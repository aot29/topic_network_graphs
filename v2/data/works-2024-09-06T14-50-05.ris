AB  - The continuous growth of scientific literature brings innovations and, at the same time, raises new challenges. One of them is related to the fact that its analysis has become difficult due to the high volume of published papers for which manual effort for annotations and management is required. Novel technological infrastructures are needed to help researchers, research policy makers, and companies to time-efficiently browse, analyse, and forecast scientific research. Knowledge graphs i.e., large networks of entities and relationships, have proved to be effective solution in this space. Scientific knowledge graphs focus on the scholarly domain and typically contain metadata describing research publications such as authors, venues, organizations, research topics, and citations. However, the current generation of knowledge graphs lacks of an explicit representation of the knowledge presented in the research papers. As such, in this paper, we present a new architecture that takes advantage of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning methods for extracting entities and relationships from research publications and integrates them in a large-scale knowledge graph. Within this research work, we (i) tackle the challenge of knowledge extraction by employing several state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing and Text Mining tools, (ii) describe an approach for integrating entities and relationships generated by these tools, (iii) show the advantage of such an hybrid system over alternative approaches, and (vi) as a chosen use case, we generated a scientific knowledge graph including 109,105 triples, extracted from 26,827 abstracts of papers within the Semantic Web domain. As our approach is general and can be applied to any domain, we expect that it can facilitate the management, analysis, dissemination, and processing of scientific knowledge.

AB  - Examining coauthorship networks is key to study scientific collaboration patterns and structural characteristics of scientific communities. Here, we studied coauthorship networks of sociologists in Italy, using temporal and multi-level quantitative analysis. By looking at publications indexed in Scopus, we detected research communities among Italian sociologists. We found that Italian sociologists are fractured in many disconnected groups. The giant connected component could be split into five main groups with a mix of three main disciplinary topics: sociology of culture and communication (present in two groups), economic sociology (present in three groups) and general sociology (present in three groups). By applying an exponential random graph model, we found that collaboration ties are mainly driven by the research interests of these groups. Other factors, such as preferential attachment, gender and affiliation homophily are also important, but the effect of gender fades away once other factors are controlled for. Our research shows the advantages of multi-level and temporal network analysis in revealing the complexity of scientific collaboration patterns.

AB  - With the advancement of scientific collaboration in the 20th century, researchers started collaborating in many research areas. Researchers and scientists no longer remain solitary individuals; instead, they collaborate to advance fundamental understandings of research topics. Various bibliometric methods are used to quantify the scientific collaboration among researchers and scientific communities. Among these different bibliometric methods, the co-authorship method is one of the most verifiable methods to quantify or analyze scientific collaboration. In this research, the initial study has been conducted to analyze interdisciplinary research (IDR) activities in the computer science domain. The ACM has classified the computer science fields. We selected the Journal of Universal Computer Science (J.UCS) for experimentation purposes. The J.UCS is the first Journal of Computer Science that addresses a complete ACM topic. Using J.UCS data, the co-authorship network of the researcher up to the 2nd level was developed. Then the co-authorship network was analyzed to find interdisciplinary among scientific communities. Additionally, the results are also visualized to comprehend the interdisciplinary among the ACM categories. A whole working web-based system has been developed, and a forced directed graph technique has been implemented to understand IDR trends in ACM categories. Finally, the IDR values between the categories are computed to quantify the collaboration trends among the ACM categories. It was found that “Artificial Intelligence” and “Information Storage and Retrieval”, “Natural Language Processing and Information Storage and Retrieval”, and “Human-Computer Interface” and “Database Applications” were found the most overlapping areas by acquiring an IDR score of 0.879, 0.711, and 0.663, respectively.

AB  - Abstract Background The COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health emergency and experts emphasize the need for rapid and a high degree of communication and interaction between all parties, in order for critical research to be implemented. We introduce a resource (website) that provides bibliometric analysis showing the current content and structure of the published literature. As new research is published daily, the analysis is regularly updated to show the status as the research field develops and matures. Methods Two bibliometric methods were employed, the first is a keyword co-occurrence analysis, based on published work available from PubMed. The second is a bibliometric coupling analysis, based on articles available through Scopus. The results are presented as clustered network graphs; available as interactive network graphs through the webpage. Results For research as of March 23rd, keyword co-occurrence analysis showed that research was organized in 4 topic clusters: “Health and pandemic management”, “The disease and its pathophysiology”, “Clinical epidemiology of the disease” and “Treatment of the disease”. Coupling analyses resulted in 4 clusters on literature that relates to “Overview of the new virus”, “Clinical medicine”, “On the virus” and “Reproduction rate and spread”. Conclusion We introduced a dynamic resource that will give a wide readership an overview of how the structure of the COVID-19 literature is developing. To illustrate what this can look like, we showed the structure as it stands three months after the virus was identified; the structure is likely to change as we progress to later stages of this pandemic.

AB  - Text classification is a fundamental task in many applications such as topic labeling, sentiment analysis, and spam detection. The text syntactic relationship and word sequence are important and useful for text classification. How to model and incorporate them to improve performance is one key challenge. Inspired by human behavior in understanding text. In this paper, we combine the syntactic relationship, sequence structure, and semantics for text representation, and propose an attention-enhanced capsule network-based text classification model. Specifically, we use graph convolutional neural networks to encode syntactic dependency trees, build multi-head attention to encode dependencies relationship in text sequence, merge with semantic information by capsule network at last. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that our approach can effectively improve the performance of text classification compared with state-of-the-art methods. The result also shows capsule network, graph convolutional neural network, and multi-headed attention has integration effects on text classification tasks.

AB  - Bibliometrics has become an essential tool for assessing and analyzing the output of scientists, cooperation between universities, the effect of state-owned science funding on national research and development performance and educational efficiency, among other applications. Therefore, professionals and scientists need a range of theoretical and practical tools to measure experimental data. This review aims to provide an up-to-date review of the various tools available for conducting bibliometric and scientometric analyses, including the sources of data acquisition, performance analysis and visualization tools. The included tools were divided into three categories: general bibliometric and performance analysis, science mapping analysis, and libraries; a description of all of them is provided. A comparative analysis of the database sources support, pre-processing capabilities, analysis and visualization options were also provided in order to facilitate its understanding. Although there are numerous bibliometric databases to obtain data for bibliometric and scientometric analysis, they have been developed for a different purpose. The number of exportable records is between 500 and 50,000 and the coverage of the different science fields is unequal in each database. Concerning the analyzed tools, Bibliometrix contains the more extensive set of techniques and suitable for practitioners through Biblioshiny. VOSviewer has a fantastic visualization and is capable of loading and exporting information from many sources. SciMAT is the tool with a powerful pre-processing and export capability. In views of the variability of features, the users need to decide the desired analysis output and chose the option that better fits into their aims.

AB  - In order to automatically generate multiple labels for the event text of the Chinese government hotline, this paper propose a multi-label classification framework based on graph convolutional network (GCN), BERT, and memory network. The framework consists of three modules: label count prediction module, label semantic insert module, and label selection module. In the label count prediction module, this paper constructs the event graph with the abstract meaning representation (AMR) and extract the event topic information vector with GCN. To predict the label count, this paper first use BERT to extract the event semantic information vector and then fuse it with the event topic information vector (GCN-BERT fusion vector) with a dynamic fusion gate. In the label semantic insert module, to obtain the event label candidate set, this paper uses a multi-hop memory network to store the event label semantic information, and then use the answer selection framework, which matches the GCN-BERT fusion vector with the event label semantic memory vector. In label selection module, this paper uses the label count based multi-label selection to sort the event label candidate set and guide to output the optimal multi-label set of the event. Comparison experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms all baselines and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each module.

AB  - Abstract Any work's citations are regarded as a key characteristic that leads to its appraisal and study. Citations are one of the most important indicators of a research publication's quality. Citations can have a favorable or bad impact on any piece of work or publication depending on a variety of circumstances, including author skill, publication venue, research topic, and so on. The goal of this study is to see how the number of co-authors affects the number of citations in research papers. There will be a correlation analysis between the number of co-authors and the number of citations for research articles, and we will observe how the number of co-authors affects the number of citations for publications. Citation data is gathered from databases such as DBLP, ACM, MAG (Microsoft Academic Graph), and others. There are 629,814 papers and 632,752 citations in the initial version. We use two methods to examine the impact of co-author count on the number of citations in a research paper: (i) Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC), and (ii) multiple regression (MR). To test the impact of co-author count on citation count of research publications, we calculate Pearson’s correlation coefficient (ra) between the two variables number of authors (NA) and citation count (CC). We also calculate Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the citation count (CC) and the most effective variables to compare between the impact of the number of authors and the impact of the other factors such as (i) rc between number of countries (NC) and citation count (CC). (ii) rv between venue category (VC) and citation count (CC). (iii) ry between Year_From (YF) and citation count (CC). Empirical evidence shows that co-authored publications achieve higher visibility and impact. To predict the number of citations from the previously mentioned factors (NA, NC, VC, and YF), we use multiple linear regression (MLR). The goal of multiple linear regression (MLR) is to model the linear relationship between the explanatory (independent) variables and response (dependent) variables. The higher R-square, the tight relationship exists between dependent variables and independent variables. It is observed that the R-square decreases in the case of removing NA which means that the NA is the most influential factor (the relation between NA and CC is the most powerful relation). The main originality of this paper is to introduce an effective prediction module (EPM) which uses probabilistic neural network (PNN) to predict the number of citations from the most effective factors (NA, NC, VC, and YF).

AB  - Is cognitive science interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary? We contribute to this debate by examining the authorship structure and topic similarity of contributions to the Cognitive Science Society from 2000 to 2019. We compare findings from CogSci to abstracts from the Vision Science Society over the same time frame. Our analysis focuses on graph theoretic features of the co-authorship network—edge density, transitivity, and maximum subgraph size—as well as clustering within the topic space of CogSci contributions. We also combine structural and semantic information with an analysis of homophily. We validate this approach by predicting new collaborations in this year’s CogSci proceedings. Our results suggest that cognitive science has become increasingly interdisciplinary in the last 19 years. More broadly, we argue that a formal quantitative approach which combines structural co-authorship information and semantic topic analysis provides inroads to questions about the level of interdisciplinary collaboration in the cognitive science community.

AB  - Finding the news of same case from the large numbers of case-involved news is an important basis for public opinion analysis. Existing text clustering methods usually based on topic models which only use topic and case infomation as the global features of documents, so distinguishing between different cases with similar types remains a challenge. The contents of documents contain rich local features. Taking into account the internal features of news, the information of cases and the contributions provided by different topics, we propose a clustering method of case-involved news, which combines topic network and multi-head attention mechanism. Using case information and topic information to construct a topic network, then extracting the global features by graph convolution network, thus realizing the combination of case information and topic information. At the same time, the local features are extracted by multi-head attention mechanism. Finally, the fusion of global features and local features is realized by variational auto-encoder, and the learned latent representations are used for clustering. The experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised clustering methods.

AB  - The proliferation of short texts resulting from the rapid advancements of social networks, online communication, and e-commerce has created a pressing need for short text classification in various applications. This paper presents a novel approach for short text classification, which combines a hierarchical heterogeneous graph with latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) fusion. Our method first models the short text dataset as a hierarchical heterogeneous graph, which incorporates more syntactic and semantic information through a word graph, parts-of-speech (POS) tag graph, and entity graph. We then connected the representation of these three feature maps to derive a comprehensive feature vector for the text. Finally, we used the LDA topic model to adjust the feature weight, enhancing the effectiveness of short text extension. Our experiments demonstrated that our proposed approach has a promising performance in English short text classification, while in Chinese short text classification, although slightly inferior to the LDA + TF-IDF method, it still achieved promising results.

AB  - Abstract Is cognitive science interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary? We contribute to this debate by examining the authorship structure and topic similarity of contributions to the Cognitive Science Society from 2000 to 2019. Our analysis focuses on graph theoretic features of the co‐authorship network—edge density, transitivity, and maximum subgraph size—as well as clustering within the space of scientific topics. We also combine structural and semantic information with an analysis of how authors choose their collaborators based on their interests and prior collaborations. We compare findings from CogSci to abstracts from the Vision Science Society over the same time frame and validate our approach by predicting new collaborations in the 2020 CogSci proceedings. Our results suggest that collaboration across authors and topics within cognitive science has become increasingly integrated in the last 19 years. More broadly, we argue that a formal quantitative approach which combines structural co‐authorship information and semantic topic analysis provides inroads to questions about the level of interdisciplinary collaboration in a scientific community.

AB  - Prior work finds a diversity paradox: Diversity breeds innovation, yet underrepresented groups that diversify organizations have less successful careers within them. Does the diversity paradox hold for scientists as well? We study this by utilizing a near-complete population of ∼1.2 million US doctoral recipients from 1977 to 2015 and following their careers into publishing and faculty positions. We use text analysis and machine learning to answer a series of questions: How do we detect scientific innovations? Are underrepresented groups more likely to generate scientific innovations? And are the innovations of underrepresented groups adopted and rewarded? Our analyses show that underrepresented groups produce higher rates of scientific novelty. However, their novel contributions are devalued and discounted: For example, novel contributions by gender and racial minorities are taken up by other scholars at lower rates than novel contributions by gender and racial majorities, and equally impactful contributions of gender and racial minorities are less likely to result in successful scientific careers than for majority groups. These results suggest there may be unwarranted reproduction of stratification in academic careers that discounts diversity's role in innovation and partly explains the underrepresentation of some groups in academia.

AB  - Currently, the Internet has given people the opportunity to access to human knowledge quickly and conveniently through various channels such as Web pages, social networks, digital libraries, portals... However, with the process of exchanging and updating information quickly, the volume of information stored (in the form of digital documents) is increasing rapidly. Therefore, we are facing challenges in representing, storing, sorting and classifying documents.In this paper, we present a new approach to text classification. This approach is based on semi-supervised machine learning and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The new point of the study is that instead of calculating the distance between the vectors by Euclidean distance, we use geodesic distance. To do this, the text must first be expressed as an n-dimensional vector. In the n-dimensional vector space, each vector is represented by one point; use geodesic distance to calculate the distance from a point to nearby points and connect into a graph. The classification is based on calculating the shortest path between vertices on the graph through a kernel function. We conducted experiments on articles taken from Reuters on 5 different topics. To evaluate the proposed method, we tested the SVM method with the traditional calculation based on Euclidean distance and the method we proposed based on geodesic distance. The experiment was performed on the same data set of 5 topics: Business, Markets, World, Politics, and Technology. The results showed that the correct classification rate is better than the traditional SVM method based on Euclidean distance (average of 3.2 %)

AB  - Efficient distributed numerical word representation models (word embeddings) combined with modern machine learning algorithms have recently yielded considerable improvement on automatic document classification tasks. However, the effectiveness of such techniques has not been assessed for the hierarchical text classification (HTC) yet. This study investigates the application of those models and algorithms on this specific problem by means of experimentation and analysis. We trained classification models with prominent machine learning algorithm implementations—fastText, XGBoost, SVM, and Keras’ CNN—and noticeable word embeddings generation methods—GloVe, word2vec, and fastText—with publicly available data and evaluated them with measures specifically appropriate for the hierarchical context. FastText achieved an lcaF1 of 0.893 on a single-labeled version of the RCV1 dataset. An analysis indicates that using word embeddings and its flavors is a very promising approach for HTC.

AB  - New sources of citation data have recently become available, such as Microsoft Academic, Dimensions, and the OpenCitations Index of CrossRef open DOI-to-DOI citations (COCI). Although these have been compared to the Web of Science Core Collection (WoS), Scopus, or Google Scholar, there is no systematic evidence of their differences across subject categories. In response, this paper investigates 3,073,351 citations found by these six data sources to 2,515 English-language highly-cited documents published in 2006 from 252 subject categories, expanding and updating the largest previous study. Google Scholar found 88% of all citations, many of which were not found by the other sources, and nearly all citations found by the remaining sources (89-94%). A similar pattern held within most subject categories. Microsoft Academic is the second largest overall (60% of all citations), including 82% of Scopus citations and 86% of WoS citations. In most categories, Microsoft Academic found more citations than Scopus and WoS (182 and 223 subject categories, respectively), but had coverage gaps in some areas, such as Physics and some Humanities categories. After Scopus, Dimensions is fourth largest (54% of all citations), including 84% of Scopus citations and 88% of WoS citations. It found more citations than Scopus in 36 categories, more than WoS in 185, and displays some coverage gaps, especially in the Humanities. Following WoS, COCI is the smallest, with 28% of all citations. Google Scholar is still the most comprehensive source. In many subject categories Microsoft Academic and Dimensions are good alternatives to Scopus and WoS in terms of coverage.

AB  - We propose a new framework for research synthesis of both evidence and influence, named research weaving. It summarizes and visualizes information content, history, and networks among a collection of documents on any given topic. Research weaving achieves this feat by combining the power of two methods: systematic mapping and bibliometrics. Systematic mapping provides a snapshot of the current state of knowledge, identifying areas needing more research attention and those ready for full synthesis. Bibliometrics enables researchers to see how pieces of evidence are connected, revealing the structure and development of a field. We explain how researchers can use some or all of these tools to gain a deeper, more nuanced understanding of the scientific literature.

AB  - Until recently, comprehensive scientometrics data has been made available only in siloed, subscription-based tools that are inaccessible to researchers who lack institutional support and resources. As a result of limited data access, research evaluation practices have focused upon basic indicators that only take publications and their citation rates into account. This has blocked innovation on many fronts. Dimensions is a database that links and contextualizes different research information objects. It brings together data describing and linking awarded grants, clinical trials, patents, and policy documents, as well as altmetric information, alongside traditional publications and citations data. This article describes the approach that Digital Science is taking to support the scientometric community, together with the various Dimensions tools available to researchers who wish to use Dimensions data in their research at no cost.

AB  - Accurate semantic representation models are essential in text mining applications. For a successful application of the text mining process, the text representation adopted must keep the interesting patterns to be discovered. Although competitive results for automatic text classification may be achieved with traditional bag of words, such representation model cannot provide satisfactory classification performances on hard settings where richer text representations are required. In this paper, we present an approach to represent document collections based on embedded representations of words and word senses. We bring together the power of word sense disambiguation and the semantic richness of word- and word-sense embedded vectors to construct embedded representations of document collections. Our approach results in semantically enhanced and low-dimensional representations. We overcome the lack of interpretability of embedded vectors, which is a drawback of this kind of representation, with the use of word sense embedded vectors. Moreover, the experimental evaluation indicates that the use of the proposed representations provides stable classifiers with strong quantitative results, especially in semantically-complex classification scenarios.

AB  - Text classification (TC) is the task of automatically assigning documents to a fixed number of categories. TC is an important component in many text applications. Many of these applications perform preprocessing. There are different types of text preprocessing, e.g., conversion of uppercase letters into lowercase letters, HTML tag removal, stopword removal, punctuation mark removal, lemmatization, correction of common misspelled words, and reduction of replicated characters. We hypothesize that the application of different combinations of preprocessing methods can improve TC results. Therefore, we performed an extensive and systematic set of TC experiments (and this is our main research contribution) to explore the impact of all possible combinations of five/six basic preprocessing methods on four benchmark text corpora (and not samples of them) using three ML methods and training and test sets. The general conclusion (at least for the datasets verified) is that it is always advisable to perform an extensive and systematic variety of preprocessing methods combined with TC experiments because it contributes to improve TC accuracy. For all the tested datasets, there was always at least one combination of basic preprocessing methods that could be recommended to significantly improve the TC using a BOW representation. For three datasets, stopword removal was the only single preprocessing method that enabled a significant improvement compared to the baseline result using a bag of 1,000-word unigrams. For some of the datasets, there was minimal improvement when we removed HTML tags, performed spelling correction or removed punctuation marks, and reduced replicated characters. However, for the fourth dataset, the stopword removal was not beneficial. Instead, the conversion of uppercase letters into lowercase letters was the only single preprocessing method that demonstrated a significant improvement compared to the baseline result. The best result for this dataset was obtained when we performed spelling correction and conversion into lowercase letters. In general, for all the datasets processed, there was always at least one combination of basic preprocessing methods that could be recommended to improve the accuracy results when using a bag-of-words representation.

AB  - Hierarchical text classification, which aims to classify text documents into a given hierarchy, is an important task in many real-world applications. Recently, deep neural models are gaining increasing popularity for text classification due to their expressive power and minimum requirement for feature engineering. However, applying deep neural networks for hierarchical text classification remains challenging, because they heavily rely on a large amount of training data and meanwhile cannot easily determine appropriate levels of documents in the hierarchical setting. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised neural method for hierarchical text classification. Our method does not require a large amount of training data but requires only easy-to-provide weak supervision signals such as a few class-related documents or keywords. Our method effectively leverages such weak supervision signals to generate pseudo documents for model pre-training, and then performs self-training on real unlabeled data to iteratively refine the model. During the training process, our model features a hierarchical neural structure, which mimics the given hierarchy and is capable of determining the proper levels for documents with a blocking mechanism. Experiments on three datasets from different domains demonstrate the efficacy of our method compared with a comprehensive set of baselines.

AB  - Many academic analyses of good practice in the use of bibliometric data address only technical aspects and fail to account for and appreciate user requirements, expectations, and actual practice. Bibliometric indicators are rarely the only evidence put before any user group. In the present state of knowledge, it is more important to consider how quantitative evaluation can be made simple, transparent, and readily understood than it is to focus unduly on precision, accuracy, or scholarly notions of purity. We discuss how the interpretation of ‘performance’ from a presentation using accurate but summary bibliometrics can change when iterative deconstruction and visualization of the same dataset is applied. From the perspective of a research manager with limited resources, investment decisions can easily go awry at governmental, funding program, and institutional levels. By exploring select real-life data samples we also show how the specific composition of each dataset can influence interpretive outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Citations and text analysis are both used to study the distribution and flow of ideas between researchers, fields and countries, but the resulting flows are rarely equal. We argue that the differences in these two flows capture a growing global inequality in the production of scientific knowledge. We offer a framework called ‘citational lensing’ to identify where citations should appear between countries but are absent given that what is embedded in their published abstract texts is highly similar. This framework also identifies where citations are overabundant given lower similarity. Our data come from nearly 20 million papers across nearly 35 years and 150 fields from the Microsoft Academic Graph. We find that scientific communities increasingly centre research from highly active countries while overlooking work from peripheral countries. This inequality is likely to pose substantial challenges to the growth of novel ideas.

AB  - The multi-label text classification task aims to tag a document with a series of labels. Previous studies usually treated labels as symbols without semantics and ignored the relation among labels, which caused information loss. In this paper, we show that explicitly modeling label semantics can improve multi-label text classification. We propose a hybrid neural network model to simultaneously take advantage of both label semantics and fine-grained text information. Specifically, we utilize the pre-trained BERT model to compute context-aware representation of documents. Furthermore, we incorporate the label semantics in two stages. First, a novel label graph construction approach is proposed to capture the label structures and correlations. Second, we propose a neoteric attention mechanism-adjustive attention to establish the semantic connections between labels and words and to obtain the label-specific word representation. The hybrid representation that combines context-aware feature and label-special word feature is fed into a document encoder to classify. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets show that our model is superior to other state-of-the-art classification methods.

AB  - Citation analysis does not tell the whole story about the innovativeness of scientific papers. Works by prominent authors tend to receive disproportionately many citations, while publications by less well-known researchers covering the same topics may not attract as much attention. In this paper we address the shortcomings of traditional scientometric approaches by proposing a novel method that utilizes a classifier for predicting publication years based on latent topic distributions. We then calculate real-number innovation scores used to identify potential breakthrough papers and turnaround years. The proposed approach can complement existing citation-based measures of article importance and author contribution analysis; it opens as well novel research direction for time-based, innovation-centered research scientific output evaluation. In our experiments, we focus on two corpora of research papers published over several decades at two well-established conferences: The World Wide Web Conference (WWW) and the International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR), containing around 3500 documents in total. We indicate significant years and demonstrate examples of highly-ranked papers, thus providing a novel insight on the evolution of the two conferences. Finally, we compare our results to citation analysis and discuss how our approach may complement traditional scientometrics.

AB  - With the growing number of published scientific papers world-wide, the need to evaluation and quality assessment methods for research papers is increasing. Scientific fields such as scientometrics, informetrics, and bibliometrics establish quantified analysis methods and measurements for evaluating scientific papers. In this area, an important problem is to predict the future influence of a published paper. Particularly, early discrimination between influential papers and insignificant papers may find important applications. In this regard, one of the most important metrics is the number of citations to the paper, since this metric is widely utilized in the evaluation of scientific publications and moreover, it serves as the basis for many other metrics such as h-index. In this paper, we propose a novel method for predicting long-term citations of a paper based on the number of its citations in the first few years after publication. In order to train a citation count prediction model, we employed artificial neural network which is a powerful machine learning tool with recently growing applications in many domains including image and text processing. The empirical experiments show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with respect to the prediction accuracy in both yearly and total prediction of the number of citations.

AB  - The goal in extreme multi-label classification (XMC) is to learn a classifier which can assign a small subset of relevant labels to an instance from an extremely large set of target labels. The distribution of training instances among labels in XMC exhibits a long tail, implying that a large fraction of labels have a very small number of positive training instances. Detecting tail-labels, which represent diversity of the label space and account for a large fraction (upto 80%) of all the labels, has been a significant research challenge in XMC. In this work, we pose the tail-label detection task in XMC as robust learning in the presence of worst-case perturbations. This viewpoint is motivated by a key observation that there is a significant change in the distribution of the feature composition of instances of these labels from the training set to test set. For shallow classifiers, our robustness perspective to XMC naturally motivates the well-known $$\ell _1$$ -regularized classification. Contrary to the popular belief that Hamming loss is unsuitable for tail-labels detection in XMC, we show that minimizing (convex upper bound on) Hamming loss with appropriate regularization surpasses many state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we also highlight the sub-optimality of the co-ordinate descent based solver in the LibLinear package, which, given its ubiquity, is interesting in its own right. We also investigate the spectral properties of label graphs for providing novel insights towards understanding the conditions governing the performance of Hamming loss based one-vs-rest scheme vis-à-vis label embedding methods.

AB  - Dramatic changes in the technology landscape marked by increasing scales and pervasiveness of compute and data have resulted in the proliferation of edge applications aimed at effectively processing data in a timely manner. As the levels and fidelity of instrumentation increases and the types and volumes of available data grow, new classes of applications are being explored that seamlessly combine real-time data with complex models and data analytics to monitor and manage systems of interest. However, these applications require a fluid integration of resources at the edge, the core, and along the data path to support dynamic and data-driven application workflows, that is, they need to leverage a computing continuum. In this article, we present our vision for enabling such a computing continuum and specifically focus on enabling edge-to-cloud integration to support data-driven workflows. The research is driven by an online data-driven tsunami warning use case that is supported by the deployment of large-scale national environment observation systems. This article presents our overall approach as well as current status and next steps.

AB  - Artificial intelligence, as an emerging and multidisciplinary domain of research and innovation, has attracted growing attention in recent years. Delineating the domain composition of artificial intelligence is central to profiling and tracking its development and trajectories. This paper puts forward a bibliometric definition for artificial intelligence which can be readily applied, including by researchers, managers, and policy analysts. Our approach starts with benchmark records of artificial intelligence captured by using a core keyword and specialized journal search. We then extract candidate terms from high frequency keywords of benchmark records, refine keywords and complement with the subject category "artificial intelligence". We assess our search approach by comparing it with other three recent search strategies of artificial intelligence, using a common source of articles from the Web of Science. Using this source, we then profile patterns of growth and international diffusion of scientific research in artificial intelligence in recent years, identify top research sponsors in funding artificial intelligence and demonstrate how diverse disciplines contribute to the multidisciplinary development of artificial intelligence. We conclude with implications for search strategy development and suggestions of lines for further research.

AB  - Throughout history, a relatively small number of individuals have made a profound and lasting impact on science and society. Despite long-standing, multi-disciplinary interests in understanding careers of elite scientists, there have been limited attempts for a quantitative, career-level analysis. Here, we leverage a comprehensive dataset we assembled, allowing us to trace the entire career histories of nearly all Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine over the past century. We find that, although Nobel laureates were energetic producers from the outset, producing works that garner unusually high impact, their careers before winning the prize follow relatively similar patterns as ordinary scientists, being characterized by hot streaks and increasing reliance on collaborations. We also uncovered notable variations along their careers, often associated with the Nobel prize, including shifting coauthorship structure in the prize-winning work, and a significant but temporary dip in the impact of work they produce after winning the Nobel. Together, these results document quantitative patterns governing the careers of scientific elites, offering an empirical basis for a deeper understanding of the hallmarks of exceptional careers in science.

AB  - Abstract The amount of omics data in the public domain is increasing every year. Modern science has become a data-intensive discipline. Innovative solutions for data management, data sharing, and for discovering novel datasets are therefore increasingly required. In 2016, we released the first version of the Omics Discovery Index (OmicsDI) as a light-weight system to aggregate datasets across multiple public omics data resources. OmicsDI aggregates genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and multiomics datasets, as well as computational models of biological processes. Here, we propose a set of novel metrics to quantify the attention and impact of biomedical datasets. A complete framework (now integrated into OmicsDI) has been implemented in order to provide and evaluate those metrics. Finally, we propose a set of recommendations for authors, journals and data resources to promote an optimal quantification of the impact of datasets.

AB  - Working with data is an increasingly powerful way of making knowledge claims about the world. There is, however, a growing gap between those who can work effectively with data and those who cannot. Because it is state and corporate actors who possess the resources to collect, store and analyze data, individuals (e.g., citizens, community members, professionals) are more likely to be the subjects of data than to use data for civic purposes. There is a strong case to be made for cultivating data literacy for people in non-technical fields as one way of bridging this gap. Literacy, following the model of popular education proposed by Paulo Freire, requires not only the acquisition of technical skills but also the emancipation achieved through the literacy process. This article proposes the term creative data literacy to refer to the fact that non-technical learners may need pathways towards data which do not come from technical fields. Here I offer five tactics to cultivate creative data literacy for empowerment. They are grounded in my experience as a data literacy researcher, educator and software developer. Each tactic is explained and introduced with examples. I assert that working towards creative data literacy is not only the work of educators but also of data creators, data publishers, tool developers, tool and visualization designers, tutorial authors, government, community organizers and artists.

AB  - In this paper we perform a comparative analysis of three models for a feature representation of text documents in the context of document classification. In particular, we consider the most often used family of bag-of-words models, the recently proposed continuous space models word2vec and doc2vec, and the model based on the representation of text documents as language networks. While the bag-of-word models have been extensively used for the document classification task, the performance of the other two models for the same task have not been well understood. This is especially true for the network-based models that have been rarely considered for the representation of text documents for classification. In this study, we measure the performance of the document classifiers trained using the method of random forests for features generated with the three models and their variants. Multi-objective rankings are proposed as the framework for multi-criteria comparative analysis of the results. Finally, the results of the empirical comparison show that the commonly used bag-of-words model has a performance comparable to the one obtained by the emerging continuous-space model of doc2vec. In particular, the low-dimensional variants of doc2vec generating up to 75 features are among the top-performing document representation models. The results finally point out that doc2vec shows a superior performance in the tasks of classifying large documents.

AB  - Nowadays, big data has become a hot research topic. It gives fresh impetus to the economic and social development. However, the huge value of big data also makes it the focus of attacks. Big data security incidents occur frequently in recent years. The security supervision capacities for big data do not match its important role. Data provenance which describes the origins of data and the process by which it arrived the current state, is an effective approach for data supervision. For the full use of provenance in big data supervision, a provenance model which defines the concepts used to represent the provenance types and relations is required to be built in advance, but current provenance models do not adapt to big data scenarios well. In this paper, we comprehensively consider the characteristics of big data and the requirements of data security supervision, extend the widely used provenance model PROV-DM by subtyping and new relation definition, and propose a big data provenance model (BDPM) for data supervision. BDPM model supports the provenance representation of various data types and diverse data processing modes to represent the entire data transformation process through different components in the big data system, and defines new relations to enrich provenance analysis functions. Based on BDPM model, we introduce the constraints that should be satisfied in the construction of valid provenance graph and present the data security supervision methods via provenance graph analysis. Finally, we evaluated the satisfiability of BDPM model through a case study.

AB  - Marine data are needed for many purposes: for acquiring a better scientific understanding of the marine environment, but also, increasingly, as marine knowledge for decision making as well as developing products and services supporting economic growth. Data must be of sufficient quality to meet the specific users' needs. It must also be accessible in a timely manner. And yet, despite being critical, this timely access to known-quality data proves challenging. Europe's marine data have traditionally been collected by a myriad of entities with the result that much of our data are scattered throughout unconnected databases and repositories. Even when data are available, they are often not compatible, making the sharing of the information and data aggregation particularly challenging. In this paper, we present how the European Marine Observation and Data network (EMODnet) has developed over the last decade to tackle these issues. Today, EMODnet is comprised of more than 150 organisations which gather marine data, metadata and data products and make them more easily accessible for a wider range of users. EMODnet currently consists of seven sub-portals: bathymetry, geology, physics, chemistry, biology, seabed habitats and human activities. In addition, Sea-basin Checkpoints have been established to assess the observation capacity in the North Sea, Mediterranean, Atlantic, Baltic, Artic and Black Sea. The Checkpoints identify whether the observation infrastructure in Europe meets the needs of users by undertaking a number of challenges. To complement this, a Data Ingestion Service has been set up to tackle the problem of the wealth of marine data that remain unavailable, by reaching out to data holders, explaining the benefits of sharing their data and offering a support service to assist them in releasing their data and making them available through EMODnet. The EMODnet Central Portal (www.emodnet.eu) provides a single point of access to these services, which are free to access and use. The strategic vision of EMODnet in the next decade is also presented, together with key focal areas towards a more user-oriented service, including EMODnet for business, internationalization for global users and stakeholder engagement to connect the diverse communities across the marine knowledge value chain.

AB  - Multi-label document classification (MLDC) problems can be challenging, especially for long documents with a large label set and a long-tail distribution over labels. In this paper, we present an effective convolutional attention network for the MLDC problem with a focus on medical code prediction from clinical documents. Our innovations are three-fold: (1) we utilize a deep convolution-based encoder with the squeeze-and-excitation networks and residual networks to aggregate the information across the document and learn meaningful document representations that cover different ranges of texts; (2) we explore multi-layer and sum-pooling attention to extract the most informative features from these multi-scale representations; (3) we combine binary cross entropy loss and focal loss to improve performance for rare labels. We focus our evaluation study on MIMIC-III, a widely used dataset in the medical domain. Our models outperform prior work on medical coding and achieve new state-of-the-art results on multiple metrics. We also demonstrate the language independent nature of our approach by applying it to two non-English datasets. Our model outperforms prior best model and a multilingual Transformer model by a substantial margin.

AB  - Currently, with the growth of the Internet of Things devices and the emergence of massive edge resources, security protection content has not only empowered IoT devices with the accumulation of networked computing and storage as a flexible whole but also enabled storing, transferring and processing DIKW (data, information, knowledge, and wisdom) content at the edge of the network from multiple devices in a mobile manner.However, understanding various DIKW content or resources poses a conceptual challenge in unifying the semantics of the core concepts as a starting point.Through building metamodels of the DIKW framework, we propose to cognitively formalize the semantics of the key elements of the DIKW in a conceptual process.The formalization centers on modeling the perceived world only by relationships or semantics as the prime atomic comprising elements.Based on this cognitive world model, we reveal the difference between relationships and entities during the conceptualization process as a foundation for distinguishing data and information.Thereafter, we show the initial case for using this formalization to construct security protection solutions for edge computing scenarios centering on type conversions among typed resources formalized through our proposed formalization of the DIKW.

AB  - Effective collaboration in data science can leverage domain expertise from each team member and thus improve the quality and efficiency of the work. Computational notebooks give data scientists a convenient interactive solution for sharing and keeping track of the data exploration process through a combination of code, narrative text, visualizations, and other rich media. In this paper, we report how synchronous editing in computational notebooks changes the way data scientists work together compared to working on individual notebooks. We first conducted a formative survey with 195 data scientists to understand their past experience with collaboration in the context of data science. Next, we carried out an observational study of 24 data scientists working in pairs remotely to solve a typical data science predictive modeling problem, working on either notebooks supported by synchronous groupware or individual notebooks in a collaborative setting. The study showed that working on the synchronous notebooks improves collaboration by creating a shared context, encouraging more exploration, and reducing communication costs. However, the current synchronous editing features may lead to unbalanced participation and activity interference without strategic coordination. The synchronous notebooks may also amplify the tension between quick exploration and clear explanations. Building on these findings, we propose several design implications aimed at better supporting collaborative editing in computational notebooks, and thus improving efficiency in teamwork among data scientists.

AB  - The use of background knowledge is largely unexploited in text classification tasks. This paper explores word taxonomies as means for constructing new semantic features, which may improve the performance and robustness of the learned classifiers. We propose tax2vec, a parallel algorithm for constructing taxonomy-based features, and demonstrate its use on six short text classification problems: prediction of gender, personality type, age, news topics, drug side effects and drug effectiveness. The constructed semantic features, in combination with fast linear classifiers, tested against strong baselines such as hierarchical attention neural networks, achieves comparable classification results on short text documents. The algorithm’s performance is also tested in a few-shot learning setting, indicating that the inclusion of semantic features can improve the performance in data-scarce situations. The tax2vec capability to extract corpus-specific semantic keywords is also demonstrated. Finally, we investigate the semantic space of potential features, where we observe a similarity with the well known Zipf’s law.

AB  - Patent categorization, which is to assign multiple International Patent Classification (IPC) codes to a patent document, relies heavily on expert efforts, as it requires substantial domain knowledge. When formulated as a multi-label text classification (MTC) problem, it draws two challenges to existing models: one is to learn effective document representations from text content; the other is to model the cross-section behavior of label set. In this work, we propose a label attention model based on graph convolutional network. It jointly learns the document-word associations and word-word co-occurrences to generate rich semantic embeddings of documents. It employs a non-local attention mechanism to learn label representations in the same space of document representations for multi-label classification. On a large CIRCA patent database, we evaluate the performance of our model and as many as seven competitive baselines. We find that our model outperforms all those prior state of the art by a large margin and achieves high performance on P@k and nDCG@k.

AB  - The scholarly output of the new coronavirus research has been proliferating. During five months, an amount of 14,588 scientific publications about nCoV-2 and COVID-19 has been generated intensively (as indexed in Scopus on 31 May 2020). Such a knowledge outburst has created ample interest in understanding the research landscape of this newly configured area. This paper demonstrates on scientometric dimensions of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) research using quantifiable characteristics of the publication dataset. Findings reveal that the rate of publication growth (1600%) is very significant to a synergic response of the researchers to combat with the most extended sequence of an RNA virus. Indeed their response has geared up to an average of 100 articles per day. Many scholarly publishers have disclosed their preprint servers to make the publications available immediately, even by enabling Open Access. The scientific contents have published in more than 500 journals from 240 academic publishers. While the top-ten publishers occupied almost 70% of the articles, then about 25% of the studies were sponsored by 300 funding agencies. Among the notable journals Lancet, Nature, BMJ, JAMA, JMV, and NEJM are prominent. Findings also reveal that majority of the contributions have occurred in Medical Science, focusing on virology, immunology, epidemiology, pharmacology, public health, critical care, and emergency medicine. However, the closely associated terms are virus transmission, infection control, asymptomatic, quarantine, pneumonia, human, disease severity, clinical trials, viral pathogenesis, pandemic, risk, and mortality. The study suggests that academic hubs are located mostly in the USA, China, Italy, and the UK. Among the productive institutions; Huazhong Univ (China), Tongji Med. College (China), Harvard Med. School (USA), Univ of Milan (Italy), INSERM (France), UCL (UK) are outstanding. The G7 countries together produced 50% of the global research output on nCov-2. It also noted an encouraging trend of collaborative research across many countries and disciplines, where the values of CI (6.46), DC (0.79), and CC (0.59) are very significant. It examines the geographical diversity of the collaborating authors, thereby visualized their linkages via co-authorship occurrences. Finally, it analyzed the publications' impact to showcase the most influential contributions of the new coronavirus research.

AB  - In past years, we have witnessed the fields of geosciences and remote sensing and artificial intelligence (AI) become closer. Thanks to the massive availability of observational data, improved simulations, and algorithmic advances, these disciplines have found common objectives and challenges to help advance the modeling and understanding of the Earth system. Despite such great opportunities, we have also observed a worrisome tendency to remain in disciplinary comfort zones, applying recent advances from AI on well-resolved remote sensing problems. Here, we take a position on the research directions for which we think the interface between these fields will have the most significant impact and become potential game changers. In our declared agenda for AI in Earth sciences, we aim to inspire researchers, especially the younger generations, to tackle these challenges for a real advance of remote sensing and the geosciences.

AB  - Categorizing Arabic text documents is considered an important research topic in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML).The number of Arabic documents is tremendously increasing daily as new web pages, news articles, social media contents are added.Hence, classifying such documents in specific classes is of high importance to many people and applications.Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a class of deep learning that has been shown to be useful for many NLP tasks, including text translation and text categorization for the English language.Word embedding is a text representation currently used to represent text terms as real-valued vectors in vector space that represent both syntactic and semantic traits of text.Current research studies in classifying Arabic text documents use traditional text representation such as bag-of-words and TF-IDF weighting, but few use word embedding.Traditional ML algorithms have already been used in Arabic text categorization, and good results are achieved.In this study, we present a Multi-Kernel CNN model for classifying Arabic news documents enriched with n-gram word embedding, which we call A Superior Arabic Text Categorization Deep Model (SATCDM).The proposed solution achieves very high accuracy compared to current research in Arabic text categorization using 15 of freely available datasets.The model achieves an accuracy ranging from 97.58% to 99.90%, which is superior to similar studies on the Arabic document classification task.

AB  - Hands-on practice is a critical component of cybersecurity education. Most of the existing hands-on exercises or labs materials are usually managed in a problem-centric fashion, while it lacks a coherent way to manage existing labs and provide productive lab exercising plans for cybersecurity learners. With the advantages of big data and natural language processing (NLP) technologies, constructing a large knowledge graph and mining concepts from unstructured text becomes possible, which motivated us to construct a machine learning based lab exercising plan for cybersecurity education. In the research presented by this paper, we have constructed a knowledge graph in the cybersecurity domain using NLP technologies including machine learning based word embedding and hyperlink-based concept mining. We then utilized the knowledge graph during the regular learning process based on the following approaches: 1. We constructed a web-based front-end to visualize the knowledge graph, which allows students to browse and search cybersecurity-related concepts and the corresponding interdependence relations; 2. We created a personalized knowledge graph for each student based on their learning progress and status; 3. We built a personalized lab recommendation system by suggesting more relevant labs based on students' past learning history to maximize their learning outcomes. To measure the effectiveness of the proposed solution, we have conducted a use case study and collected survey data from a graduate-level cybersecurity class. Our study shows that, by leveraging the knowledge graph for the cybersecurity area study, students tend to benefit more and show more interests in cybersecurity area.

We provide speculative answers to these questions which may be somewhat biased by our initial motivation for studying the topic: the need for provenance information in curated databases. Such databases involve extensive human interaction with data; and we argue that the need continues in other forms of human interaction such as those that take place in social media.

AB  - Abstract Social media metrics have a genuine networked nature, reflecting the networking characteristics of the social media platform from where they are derived. This networked nature has been relatively less explored in the literature on altmetrics, although new network‐level approaches are starting to appear. A general conceptualization of the role of social media networks in science communication, and particularly of social media as a specific type of interface between science and society, is still missing. The aim of this paper is to provide a conceptual framework for appraising interactions between science and society in multiple directions, in what we call heterogeneous couplings. Heterogeneous couplings are conceptualized as the co‐occurrence of science and non‐science objects, actors, and interactions in online media environments. This conceptualization provides a common framework to study the interactions between science and non‐science actors as captured via online and social media platforms. The conceptualization of heterogeneous couplings opens wider opportunities for the development of network applications and analyses of the interactions between societal and scholarly entities in social media environments, paving the way toward more advanced forms of altmetrics, social (media) studies of science, and the conceptualization and operationalization of more advanced science‐society studies.

AB  - Conventional topic models suffer from a severe sparsity problem when facing extremely short texts such as social media posts. The family of Dirichlet multinomial mixture (DMM) can handle the sparsity problem, however, they are still very sensitive to ordinary and noisy words, resulting in inaccurate topic representations at the document level. In this paper, we alleviate this problem by preserving local neighborhood structure of short texts, enabling to spread topical signals among neighboring documents, so as to correct the inaccurate topic representations. This is achieved by using variational manifold regularization, constraining the close short texts should have similar variational topic representations. Upon this idea, we propose a novel Laplacian DMM (LapDMM) topic model. During the document graph construction, we further use the word mover’s distance with word embeddings to measure document similarities at the semantic level. To evaluate LapDMM, we compare it against the state-of-theart short text topic models on several traditional tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our LapDMM achieves very significant performance gains over baseline models, e.g., achieving even about 0.2 higher scores on clustering and classification tasks in many cases.

AB  - Fast growing scientific topics have famously been key harbingers of the new frontiers of science, yet, large-scale analyses of their genesis and impact are rare. We investigate one possible factor connected with a topic's extraordinary growth: scientific prizes. Our longitudinal analysis of nearly all recognized prizes worldwide and over 11,000 scientific topics from 19 disciplines indicates that topics associated with a scientific prize experience extraordinary growth in productivity, impact, and new entrants. Relative to matched non-prizewinning topics, prizewinning topics produce 40% more papers and 33% more citations, retain 55% more scientists, and gain 37% and 47% more new entrants and star scientists, respectively, in the first five-to-ten years after the prize. Funding do not account for a prizewinning topic's growth. Rather, growth is positively related to the degree to which the prize is discipline-specific, conferred for recent research, or has prize money. These findings reveal new dynamics behind scientific innovation and investment.

AB  - Complex cycling workflows are fundamental to numerical weather prediction (NWP) and related environmental forecasting systems. Large numbers of jobs are executed at regular intervals to process new data and generate new forecasts. Dependence between these forecast cycles creates a single never-ending workflow, but NWP workflow schedulers have traditionally ignored this—at the cost of efficiency when running “off the clock”—by enforcing a simpler nonoverlapping sequence of single-cycle workflows. Cylc (“Silk”)1 –3 is designed to manage infinite cycling workflows efficiently even after delays in real-time operation, or in historical runs, when cycles can typically interleave for much-increased throughput. Cylc is not actually specialized to environmental forecasting, however, and cycling workflows may also be useful in other contexts. In this paper, we describe the origins and major features of Cylc, future plans for the project, and our experience of Open Source development and community engagement.

AB  - Compared with traditional sequential learning models, graph-based neural networks exhibit excellent properties when encoding text, such as the capacity of capturing global and local information simultaneously. Especially in the semi-supervised scenario, propagating information along the edge can effectively alleviate the sparsity of labeled data. In this paper, beyond the existing architecture of heterogeneous word-document graphs, for the first time, we investigate how to construct lightweight non-heterogeneous graphs based on different linguistic information to better serve free text representation learning. Then, a novel semi-supervised framework for text classification that refines graph topology under theoretical guidance and shares information across different text graphs, namely Text-oriented Graph-based Transductive Learning (TextGTL), is proposed. TextGTL also performs attribute space interpolation based on dense substructure in graphs to predict low-entropy labels with high-quality feature nodes for data augmentation. To verify the effectiveness of TextGTL, we conduct extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets, observing significant performance gains over conventional heterogeneous graphs. In addition, we also design ablation studies to dive deep into the validity of components in TextTGL.

AB  - Abstract Review articles are an often neglected genre in scholarly communication. Though there was intense discussion about review articles in scientometrics in the 1970s and 1980s, we find less studies devoted to this genre within the last 20 years. Yet, recent discussions in other fields, such as linguistics, sociology or medicine imply that review articles are part of important debates about problems of research in academia, such as research quality or transparency. Against that background, the purpose of this paper is to review recent developments for the study of review articles in scientometrics and beyond, to discuss theoretical, conceptual and empirical accounts of how review articles can be defined, and to identify major methodological and conceptual challenges for studying review articles. Based on reviewing work and inputs received from of a workshop conducted at a Conference of the International Society of Informetrics in September 2019, we propose a research agenda for the study of review articles. We have identified six realms of study in this area: (1) the study of methodological caveats resulting from the usage of scholarly databases, (2) the study of field specific patterns of reception and usage of review articles, (3) the study of argumentative and textual structures of review articles, (4) the exploration of organizations and infrastructures for review articles, (5) the study of epistemic roles of review articles, and (6) the analysis of authorship patterns in review articles.

AB  - The process of tagging a given text or document with suitable labels is known as text categorization or classification. The aim of this work is to automatically tag a news article based on its vocabulary features. To accomplish this objective, 2 large datasets have been constructed from various Arabic news portals. The first dataset contains of 90k single-labeled articles from 4 domains (Business, Middle East, Technology and Sports). The second dataset has over 290 k multi-tagged articles. To examine the single-label dataset, we employed an array of ten shallow learning classifiers. Furthermore, we added an ensemble model that adopts the majority-voting technique of all studied classifiers. The performance of the classifiers on the first dataset ranged between 87.7% (AdaBoost) and 97.9% (SVM). Analyzing some of the misclassified articles confirmed the need for a multi-label opposed to single-label categorization for better classification results. For the second dataset, we tested both shallow learning and deep learning multi-labeling approaches. A custom accuracy metric, designed for the multi-labeling task, has been developed for performance evaluation along with hamming loss metric. Firstly, we used classifiers that were compatible with multi-labeling tasks such as Logistic Regression and XGBoost, by wrapping each in a OneVsRest classifier. XGBoost gave the higher accuracy, scoring 84.7%, while Logistic Regression scored 81.3%. Secondly, ten neural networks were constructed (CNN, CLSTM, LSTM, BILSTM, GRU, CGRU, BIGRU, HANGRU, CRF-BILSTM and HANLSTM). CGRU proved to be the best multi-labeling classifier scoring an accuracy of 94.85%, higher than the rest of the classifies.

AB  - We propose a backward tracking model for measuring knowledge transfer in the whole translational research spectrum. Using the drugs-patents-papers-grants backward linkages, we try to figure out the funding-science-technology-innovation translational pattern and ponder some policy implications on e.g., which priority areas and knowledge convergence level are more likely to generate new drugs. The drug-patent linkage data was accessed through the USFDA Orange Book, covering a drug's active ingredient, formulation, or methods of use for approved indications. It will take about 10 years from the application of earliest patent to the approval of the new drug. Also such high-value patents in FDA Orange Book tend to cite scientific knowledge published on average 10–15 years ago. The technology linkage of new drugs was relatively stable while the science linkage of technology inventions increased rapidly. Among the scientific papers cited by drug patents, private-institution originated papers are only a quarter of the public. By linking theses scientific papers with funding sources, we found a large majority (90%) are public-funded and only a very small part are private-funded or public-private joint-funded. Our study also indicates the importance of research on such fields as pharmacology, chemistry (including medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, and organic chemistry), molecular biology, neurosciences, and immunology on new drugs innovation. There is no obvious relationship between "basicness" and linkages to the resulting patents' impact and to drugs innovation. A balanced basic research and applied research maybe essential for fostering drug innovation because it is a complete chain translating from basic discovery to clinical evidence then to clinical practice. In order to achieve successful pharmaceutical innovation, rather than focusing on only technology, convergence with science at moderate levels (maybe 1/3) is suggested.

AB  - Recruitment in the IT sector has been on the rise in recent times.Software companies are on the hunt to recruit raw talent right from the colleges through job fairs.The process of allotment of projects to the new recruits is a manual affair, usually carried out by the Human Resources department of the organization.This process of project allotment to the new recruits is a costly affair for the organization as it relies mostly on human effort.In the recent times, software companies round the world are leveraging the advances in machine learning and Artificial intelligence in general to automate routine tasks in the enterprise to increase the productivity.In the paper, we discuss the design and implementation of a resume classifier application which employs an ensemble learning based voting classifier to classify a profile of a candidate into a suitable domain based on his interest, work-experience and expertise mentioned by the candidate in the profile.The model employs topic modelling techniques to introduce a new domain to the list of domains upon failing to achieve the threshold value of confidence for the classification of the candidate profile.The Stack-Overflow REST APIs are called for the profiles which fail on the confidence threshold test set in the application.The topics returned by the APIs are subjected to topic modelling to obtain a new domain, on which the voting classifier is retrained after a fixed interval to improve the accuracy of the model.Overall, emphasis is laid out on building a dynamic machine learning automation tool which is not solely dependent on the training data in allotment of projects to the new recruits.We extended our previous work withnew learning model that has the ability to classify the resumes with better accuracy and support more new domains.

AB  - Biological, clinical, and pharmacological research now often involves analyses of genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, and interactomes, within and between individuals and across species. Due to large volumes, the analysis and integration of data generated by such high-throughput technologies have become computationally intensive, and analysis can no longer happen on a typical desktop computer. In this chapter we show how to describe and execute the same analysis using a number of workflow systems and how these follow different approaches to tackle execution and reproducibility issues. We show how any researcher can create a reusable and reproducible bioinformatics pipeline that can be deployed and run anywhere. We show how to create a scalable, reusable, and shareable workflow using four different workflow engines: the Common Workflow Language (CWL), Guix Workflow Language (GWL), Snakemake, and Nextflow. Each of which can be run in parallel. We show how to bundle a number of tools used in evolutionary biology by using Debian, GNU Guix, and Bioconda software distributions, along with the use of container systems, such as Docker, GNU Guix, and Singularity. Together these distributions represent the overall majority of software packages relevant for biology, including PAML, Muscle, MAFFT, MrBayes, and BLAST. By bundling software in lightweight containers, they can be deployed on a desktop, in the cloud, and, increasingly, on compute clusters. By bundling software through these public software distributions, and by creating reproducible and shareable pipelines using these workflow engines, not only do bioinformaticians have to spend less time reinventing the wheel but also do we get closer to the ideal of making science reproducible. The examples in this chapter allow a quick comparison of different solutions.

AB  - Although international mobility is associated with various positive outcomes, the process of knowledge transfer resulting from working abroad has not yet been sufficiently investigated. The main reason why the relationship between international mobility and knowledge transfer is still underresearched is that there are not yet reliable methods to identify knowledge transfer. The current study aims to close this research gap by introducing a network-based approach that is capable of indicating knowledge flows. Assuming that coauthorship constitutes one instance through which knowledge transfer can take place, the approach relies on coauthorship networks. In the first approach to be presented, the transfer of published knowledge is operationalized as the use of rarely cited publications. In the second approach, the transfer of methodological know-how is operationalized as the occurrence of lexical terms in abstracts of publications. The study focuses on German scientists who were internationally mobile and acted as knowledge transmitters between the country of mobility and Germany. The results show that the network-based approach is well suited to identifying the sources of knowledge, knowledge transmitters, and the recipients of knowledge. Moreover, the findings suggest that knowledge transfer processes are field specific.

AB  - The main objective of this work is to improve the quality and transparency of the medical text classification solutions. Conventional text classification methods provide users with only a restricted mechanism (based on frequency) for selecting features. In this paper, a three-stage hybrid method combining the gated attention-based bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (ABLSTM) and the regular expression based classifier is proposed for medical text classification tasks. The bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture with an attention layer allows the network to weigh words according to their perceived importance and focus on crucial parts of a sentence. Feature words (or keywords) extracted by ABLSTM model are utilized to guide the regular expression rule construction. Our proposed approach leverages the advantages of both the interpretability of rule-based algorithms and the computational power of deep learning approaches for a production-ready scenario. Experimental results on real-world medical online query data clearly validate the superiority of our system in selecting domain-specific and topic-related features. Results show that the proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 0.89 and an F1-score of 0.92 respectively. Furthermore, our experimentation also illustrates the versatility of regular expressions as a user-level tool for focusing on desired patterns and providing interpretable solutions for human modification.

AB  - Being able to duplicate published research results is an important process of conducting research whether to build upon these findings or to compare with them. This process is called "replicability" when using the original authors' artifacts (e.g., code), or "reproducibility" otherwise (e.g., re-implementing algorithms). Reproducibility and replicability of research results have gained a lot of interest recently with assessment studies being led in various fields, and they are often seen as a trigger for better result diffusion and transparency. In this work, we assess replicability in Computer Graphics, by evaluating whether the code is available and whether it works properly. As a proxy for this field we compiled, ran and analyzed 151 codes out of 374 papers from 2014, 2016 and 2018 SIGGRAPH conferences. This analysis shows a clear increase in the number of papers with available and operational research codes with a dependency on the subfields, and indicates a correlation between code replicability and citation count. We further provide an interactive tool to explore our results and evaluation data.

AB  - To deal with the problem where each instance is associated with multiple labels, a lot of multi-label learning algorithms have been developed in recent years. Some approaches have been proposed to select label-specific features to utilize discriminate features for multi-label classification. Although label correlation has been considered in learning label-specific features, the critical correlation among instances was less taken into account. In this paper, we proposed a new approach called multi-label learning with label-specific features using correlation information (LSF-CI) to learn label-specific features for each label with the consideration of both correlation information in label space and correlation information in feature space. In the LSF-CI, the instance correlation in feature space is computed by a probabilistic neighborhood graph model, and label correlation in label space is computed by cosine similarity. For multi-label data, the LSF-CI has the capability to select Label-specific features for each label as well as classify an unseen instance into a set of relevant labels. To validate the effectiveness of LSF-CI, we conducted comprehensive experiments on eight multi-label datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the LSF-CI is capable of selecting compact label-specific features, and achieving a competitive performance in comparison with the performances of the existing multi-label learning approaches.

AB  - Virtual Research Environments (VREs), also known as science gateways or virtual laboratories, assist researchers in data science by integrating tools for data discovery, data retrieval, workflow management and researcher collaboration, often coupled with a specific computing infrastructure. Recently, the push for better open data science has led to the creation of a variety of dedicated research infrastructures (RIs) that gather data and provide services to different research communities, all of which can be used independently of any specific VRE. There is therefore a need for generic VREs that can be coupled with the resources of many different RIs simultaneously, easily customised to the needs of specific communities. The resource metadata produced by these RIs rarely all adhere to any one standard or vocabulary however, making it difficult to search and discover resources independently of their providers without some translation into a common framework. Cross-RI search can be expedited by using mapping services that harvest RI-published metadata to build unified resource catalogues, but the development and operation of such services pose a number of challenges. In this paper, we discuss some of these challenges and look specifically at the VRE4EIC Metadata Portal, which uses X3ML mappings to build a single catalogue for describing data products and other resources provided by multiple RIs. The Metadata Portal was built in accordance to the e-VRE Reference Architecture, a microservice-based architecture for generic modular VREs, and uses the CERIF standard to structure its catalogued metadata. We consider the extent to which it addresses the challenges of cross-RI search, particularly in the environmental and earth science domain, and how it can be further augmented, for example to take advantage of linked vocabularies to provide more intelligent semantic search across multiple domains of discourse.

AB  - Abstract Ranking models are the main components of information retrieval systems. Several approaches to ranking are based on traditional machine learning algorithms using a set of hand-crafted features. Recently, researchers have leveraged deep learning models in information retrieval. These models are trained end-to-end to extract features from the raw data for ranking tasks, so that they overcome the limitations of hand-crafted features. A variety of deep learning models have been proposed, and each model presents a set of neural network components to extract features that are used for ranking. In this paper, we compare the proposed models in the literature along different dimensions in order to understand the major contributions and limitations of each model. In our discussion of the literature, we analyze the promising neural components, and propose future research directions. We also show the analogy between document retrieval and other retrieval tasks where the items to be ranked are structured documents, answers, images and videos.

AB  - Existing text clustering methods utilize only one representation at a time (single view), whereas multiple views can represent documents. The multiview multirepresentation method enhances clustering quality. Moreover, existing clustering methods that utilize more than one representation at a time (multiview) use representation with the same nature. Hence, using multiple views that represent data in a different representation with clustering methods is reasonable to create a diverse set of candidate clustering solutions. On this basis, an effective dynamic clustering method must consider combining multiple views of data including semantic view, lexical view (word weighting), and topic view as well as the number of clusters. The main goal of this study is to develop a new method that can improve the performance of web search result clustering (WSRC). An enhanced multiview multirepresentation consensus clustering ensemble (MMCC) method is proposed to create a set of diverse candidate solutions and select a high-quality overlapping cluster. The overlapping clusters are obtained from the candidate solutions created by different clustering methods. The framework to develop the proposed MMCC includes numerous stages: (1) acquiring the standard datasets (MORESQUE and Open Directory Project-239), which are used to validate search result clustering algorithms, (2) preprocessing the dataset, (3) applying multiview multirepresentation clustering models, (4) using the radius-based cluster number estimation algorithm, and (5) employing the consensus clustering ensemble method. Results show an improvement in clustering methods when multiview multirepresentation is used. More importantly, the proposed MMCC model improves the overall performance of WSRC compared with all single-view clustering models.

AB  - A Triple in knowledge-graph takes a form that consists of head, relation, tail. Triple Classification is used to determine the truth value of an unknown Triple. This is a hard task for 1-to-N relations using the vector-based embedding approach. We propose a new region-based embedding approach using fine-grained type chains. A novel geometric process is presented to extend the vectors of pre-trained entities into n-balls (n-dimensional balls) under the condition that head balls shall contain their tail balls. Our algorithm achieves zero energy cost, therefore, serves as a case study of perfectly imposing tree structures into vector space. An unknown Triple (h,r,x) will be predicted as true, when x’s n-ball is located in the r-subspace of h’s n-ball, following the same construction of known tails of h. The experiments are based on large datasets derived from the benchmark datasets WN11, FB13, and WN18. Our results show that the performance of the new method is related to the length of the type chain and the quality of pre-trained entityembeddings, and that performances of long chains with welltrained entity-embeddings outperform other methods in the literature.

AB  - Abstract One can point to a variety of historical milestones for gender equality in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), however, practical effects are incremental and ongoing. It is important to quantify gender differences in subdomains of scientific work in order to detect potential biases and monitor progress. In this work, we study the relevance of gender in scientific collaboration patterns in the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS), a professional society with sixteen peer-reviewed journals. Using their publication data from 1952 to 2016, we constructed a large temporal bipartite network between authors and publications, and augmented the author nodes with gender labels. We characterized differences in several basic statistics of this network over time, highlighting how they have changed with respect to relevant historical events. We find a steady increase in participation by women (e.g., fraction of authorships by women and of new women authors) starting around 1980. However, women still comprise less than 25% of the INFORMS society and an even smaller fraction of authors with many publications. Moreover, we describe a methodology for quantifying the structural role of an authorship with respect to the overall connectivity of the network, using it to measure subtle differences between authorships by women and by men. Specifically, as measures of structural importance of an authorship, we use effective resistance and contraction importance, two measures related to diffusion throughout a network. As a null model, we propose a degree-preserving temporal and geometric network model with emergent communities. Our results suggest the presence of systematic differences between the collaboration patterns of men and women that cannot be explained by only local statistics.

AB  - Representing the true label as one-hot vector is the common practice in training text classification models. However, the one-hot representation may not adequately reflect the relation between the instance and labels, as labels are often not completely independent and instances may relate to multiple labels in practice. The inadequate one-hot representations tend to train the model to be over-confident, which may result in arbitrary prediction and model overfitting, especially for confused datasets (datasets with very similar labels) or noisy datasets (datasets with labeling errors). While training models with label smoothing can ease this problem in some degree, it still fails to capture the realistic relation among labels. In this paper, we propose a novel Label Confusion Model (LCM) as an enhancement component to current popular text classification models. LCM can learn label confusion to capture semantic overlap among labels by calculating the similarity between instance and labels during training and generate a better label distribution to replace the original one-hot label vector, thus improving the final classification performance. Extensive experiments on five text classification benchmark datasets reveal the effectiveness of LCM for several widely used deep learning classification models. Further experiments also verify that LCM is especially helpful for confused or noisy datasets and superior to the label smoothing method.

AB  - Abstract With the development of the Internet, the way people read has changed, the readers are more and more willing to share their reading opinions via the reading platforms. However, as the continuous increase in the number of users and reviews on the book platforms, the review data is growing exponentially. It is difficult for people to find useful information quickly in the massive reviews. Therefore, using automated methods to identify high-quality reviews among a large number of book reviews has become a hot topic in current research. This paper studies a quality evaluation method of book reviews based on graph convolution neural network, which introduces the LDA document topic generation model to add topic nodes on the basis of review and word nodes, builds the relationship between the three nodes as edges to generate heterogeneous graph. The graph is sent to a two-layer GCN model for training. In the last, this article did experimental evaluation and analysis based on the book review data of non-commercial platforms. The results show that the proposed method is superior to the machine learning method and the traditional neural network model.

AB  - Recently, Transformer has been demonstrating promising performance in many NLP tasks and showing a trend of replacing Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Meanwhile, less attention is drawn to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) due to its weak ability in capturing sequential and long-distance dependencies, although it has excellent local feature extraction capability. In this paper, we introduce an Attentive Convolutional Transformer (ACT) that takes the advantages of both Transformer and CNN for efficient text classification. Specifically, we propose a novel attentive convolution mechanism that utilizes the semantic meaning of convolutional filters attentively to transform text from complex word space to a more informative convolutional filter space where important n-grams are captured. ACT is able to capture both local and global dependencies effectively while preserving sequential information. Experiments on various text classification tasks and detailed analyses show that ACT is a lightweight, fast, and effective universal text classifier, outperforming CNNs, RNNs, and attentive models including Transformer.

AB  - Label propagation aims to iteratively diffuse the label information from labeled examples to unlabeled examples over a similarity graph. Current label propagation algorithms cannot consistently yield satisfactory performance due to two reasons: one is the instability of single propagation method in dealing with various practical data, and the other one is the improper propagation sequence ignoring the labeling difficulties of different examples. To remedy above defects, this paper proposes a novel propagation algorithm called hybrid diffusion under ensemble teaching (HyDEnT). Specifically, HyDEnT integrates multiple propagation methods as base "learners" to fully exploit their individual wisdom, which helps HyDEnT to be stable and obtain consistent encouraging results. More importantly, HyDEnT conducts propagation under the guidance of an ensemble of "teachers". That is to say, in every propagation round the simplest curriculum examples are wisely designated by a teaching algorithm, so that their labels can be reliably and accurately decided by the learners. To optimally choose these simplest examples, every teacher in the ensemble should comprehensively consider the examples' difficulties from its own viewpoint, as well as the common knowledge shared by all the teachers. This is accomplished by a designed optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved via the block coordinate descent method. Thanks to the efforts of the teachers, all the unlabeled examples are logically propagated from simple to difficult, leading to better propagation quality of HyDEnT than the existing methods. Experiments on six popular datasets reveal that HyDEnT achieves the highest classification accuracy when compared with six state-of-the-art propagation methodologies such as harmonic functions, Fick's law assisted propagation, linear neighborhood propagation, semisupervised ensemble learning, bipartite graph-based consensus maximization, and teaching-to-learn and learning-to-teach.

AB  - Abstract Portfolio analysis is a fundamental practice of organizational leadership and is a necessary precursor of strategic planning. Successful application requires a highly detailed model of research options. We have constructed a model, the first of its kind, that accurately characterizes these options for the biomedical literature. The model comprises over 18 million PubMed documents from 1996–2019. Document relatedness was measured using a hybrid citation analysis + text similarity approach. The resulting 606.6 million document-to-document links were used to create 28,743 document clusters and an associated visual map. Clusters are characterized using metadata (e.g., phrases, MeSH) and over 20 indicators (e.g., funding, patent activity). The map and cluster-level data are embedded in Tableau to provide an interactive model enabling in-depth exploration of a research portfolio. Two example usage cases are provided, one to identify specific research opportunities related to coronavirus, and the second to identify research strengths of a large cohort of African American and Native American researchers at the University of Michigan Medical School.

AB  - We aimed at developing a structured study protocol utilizing the bibliographic web-application science performance evaluation (SciPE) to perform comprehensive scientometric analyses. Metadata related to publications derived from online databases were processed and visualized by transferring the information to an undirected multipartite graph and distinct partitioned sets of nodes. Also, institution-specific data were normalized and merged allowing precise geocoordinate positioning, to enable heatmapping and valid identification. As a result, verified, processed data regarding articles, institutions, journals, authors gender, nations and subject categories can be obtained. We recommend including the total number of publications, citations, the population, research institutions, gross domestic product, and the country-specific modified Hirsch Index and to form corresponding ratios (e.g., population/publication). Also, our approach includes implementation of bioinformatical methods such as heatmapping based on exact geocoordinates, simple chord diagrams, and the central implementation of specific ratios with plain visualization techniques. This protocol allows precise conduction of contemporaneous scientometric analyses based on bioinformatic and meta-analytical techniques, allowing to evaluate and contextualize scientific efforts. Data presentation with the depicted visualization techniques is mandatory for transparent and consistent analyses of research output across different nations and topics. Research performance can then be discussed in a synopsis of all findings.

AB  - Background: Many authors are concerned which types of peer-review articles can be cited most in academics and who were the highest-cited authors in a scientific discipline. The prerequisites are determined by: (1) classifying article types; and (2) quantifying co-author contributions. We aimed to apply Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) with social network analysis (SNA) and an authorship-weighted scheme (AWS) to meet the prerequisites above and then demonstrate the applications for scholars. Methods: By searching the PubMed database (pubmed.com), we used the keyword “Medicine” [journal] and downloaded 5,636 articles published from 2012 to 2016. A total number of 9,758 were cited in Pubmed Central (PMC). Ten MeSH terms were separated to represent the journal types of clusters using SNA to compare the difference in bibliometric indices, that is, h, g, and x as well as author impact factor(AIF). The methods of Kendall coefficient of concordance (W) and one-way ANOVA were performed to verify the internal consistency of indices and the difference across MeSH clusters. Visual representations with dashboards were shown on Google Maps. Results: We found that Kendall W is 0.97 (χ = 26.22, df = 9, P < .001) congruent with internal consistency on metrics across MeSH clusters. Both article types of methods and therapeutic use show higher frequencies than other 8 counterparts. The author Klaus Lechner (Austria) earns the highest research achievement(the mean of core articles on g = Ag = 15.35, AIF = 21, x = 3.92, h = 1) with one paper (PMID: 22732949, 2012), which was cited 23 times in 2017 and the preceding 5 years. Conclusion: Publishing article type with study methodology and design might lead to a higher IF. Both classifying article types and quantifying co-author contributions can be accommodated to other scientific disciplines. As such, which type of articles and who contributes most to a specific journal can be evaluated in the future.

AB  - Abstract Finding the most suitable co-author is one of the most important ways to conduct effective research in scientific fields. Data science has contributed to achieving this possibility significantly. The present study aims at designing a mathematical model of co-author recommender system in bioinformatics using graph mining techniques and big data applications. The present study employed an applied-developmental research method and a mixed-methods research design. The research population consisted of all scientific products in bioinformatics in the PubMed database. To achieve the research objectives, the most appropriate effective features in choosing a co-author were selected, prioritized, and weighted by experts. Then, they were weighted using graph mining techniques and big data applications. Finally, the mathematical co-author recommender system model in bioinformatics was presented. Data analysis instruments included Expert Choice, Excel, Spark, Scala and Python programming languages in a big data server. The research was conducted in four steps: (1) identifying and prioritizing the criteria effective in choosing a co-author using AHP; (2) determining the correlation degree of articles based on the criteria obtained from step 1 using algorithms and big data applications; (3) developing a mathematical co-author recommender system model; and (4) evaluating the developed mathematical model. Findings showed that the journal titles and citations criteria have the highest weight while the abstract has the lowest weight in the mathematical co-author recommender system model. The accuracy of the proposed model was 72.26. It was concluded that using content-based features and expert opinions have high potentials in recommending the most appropriate co-authors. It is expected that the proposed co-author recommender system model can provide appropriate recommendations for choosing co-authors on various fields in different contexts of scientific information. The most important innovation of this model is the use of a combination of expert opinions and systemic weights, which can accelerate the finding of co-authors and consequently saving time and achieving a greater quality of scientific products.

AB  - Author co-citation analysis (ACA) is a commonly used method to map knowledge domains and depict scientific intellectual structures. Although all authors’ information has been considered in previous studies, ACA does not distinguish credits of different collaborators within a team. Authors’ sequence in a publication illustrates their contributions and specialty of research, which offers more information as inputs of ACA. This paper considers author sequence in ACA and proposes a sequence-based ACA method. By assigning various weight values to authors with different sequences, this proposed method considers distinct contributions of co-authors influencing the effect of ACA. Extra weight is given to corresponding authors, beyond their sequence, to acknowledge their additional contributions. Results of the empirical study based on the data from the field of Library and Information Science show many details on the visualization maps of the proposed methods, such as the number of sub-fields, the position of sub-fields, the position of authors, and clarity and interpretability of visualization maps. Meanwhile, the current paper proposes a novel framework of evaluating knowledge domain maps with both quantitative and qualitative facets.

AB  - The World Wide Web and the Semantic Web are designed as a network of distributed services and datasets. The distributed character of the Web brings manifold collaborative possibilities to interchange data. The commonly adopted collaborative solutions for RDF data are centralized (e.g. SPARQL endpoints and wiki systems). But to support distributed collaboration, a system is needed, that supports divergence of datasets, brings the possibility to conflate diverged states, and allows distributed datasets to be synchronized. In this paper, we present Quit Store, it was inspired by and it builds upon the successful Git system. The approach is based on a formal expression of evolution and consolidation of distributed datasets. During the collaborative curation process, the system automatically versions the RDF dataset and tracks provenance information. It also provides support to branch, merge, and synchronize distributed RDF datasets. The merging process is guarded by specific merge strategies for RDF data. Finally, we use our reference implementation to show overall good performance and demonstrate the practical usability of the system.

AB  - The University of Texas at Dallas has proposed 24 top journals (UTD24) covering all areas related to management. UTD24 are currently the most authoritative management journals. Institutions or research scholars who have published papers in these journals are considered to have a high academic level. This study uses the paper quality published by an institution in the UTD24 journals to indicate the research quality of this institution and takes the papers published by Chinese Business School in the UTD24 journals from 2000 to 2018 as the research object. By analyzing the staged evolution process and the research hotspot of international research collaboration network (IRC network) of Chinese Business School, this paper summarizes and analyzes the factors that influence the quality of papers published by Chinese Business School in UTD24 journals: degree centrality of an institution, betweenness centrality of an institution, the degree of attention of an institution, the degree of novelty of an institution, and the number of countries cooperating with the institution. This paper divides paper quality into two parts: the total number of papers and citations per paper of an institution. Among them, degree centrality and betweenness centrality of the institution have a significant positive impact on the total number of papers of the institution. The degree of attention and the number of countries cooperating with the institution have a significant positive impact on citations per paper, and the degree of novelty has a significant negative impact on citations per paper.

AB  - Medical text classification assigns medical related text into different categories such as topics or disease types.Machine learning based techniques have been widely used to perform such tasks despite the obvious drawback in such ''black box'' approach, leaving no easy way to fine-tune the resultant model for better performance.We propose a novel constructive heuristic approach to generate a set of regular expressions that can be used as effective text classifiers.The main innovation of our approach is that we develop a novel regular expression based text classifier with both satisfactory classification performance and excellent interpretability.We evaluate our framework on real-world medical data provided by our collaborator, one of the largest online healthcare providers in the market, and observe the high performance and consistency of this approach.Experimental results show that the machine-generated regular expressions can be effectively used in conjunction with machine learning techniques to perform medical text classification tasks.The proposed methodology improves the performance of baseline methods (Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines) by 9% in precision and 4.5% in recall.We also evaluate the performance of modified regular expressions by human experts and demonstrate the potential of practical applications using the proposed method.

AB  - Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) has acquired notorious relevance in modern computing as it effectively solves complex tasks traditionally done by humans. AI provides methods to represent and infer knowledge, efficiently manipulate texts and learn from vast amount of data. These characteristics are applicable in many activities that human find laborious or repetitive, as is the case of the analysis of scientific literature. Manually preparing and writing a systematic literature review (SLR) takes considerable time and effort, since it requires planning a strategy, conducting the literature search and analysis, and reporting the findings. Depending on the area under study, the number of papers retrieved can be of hundreds or thousands, meaning that filtering those relevant ones and extracting the key information becomes a costly and error-prone process. However, some of the involved tasks are repetitive and, therefore, subject to automation by means of AI. In this paper, we present a survey of AI techniques proposed in the last 15 years to help researchers conduct systematic analyses of scientific literature. We describe the tasks currently supported, the types of algorithms applied, and available tools proposed in 34 primary studies. This survey also provides a historical perspective of the evolution of the field and the role that humans can play in an increasingly automated SLR process.

AB  - Abstract This paper presents a novel methodology for defining and analyzing the dynamics of the collaboration networks of scientists working on general relativity from the mid-1920s–1970. During these four and a half decades the status of the theory underwent a radical transformation: from a marginal theory before the mid-1950s to a pillar of modern physics. To investigate this passage—known as the renaissance of general relativity—we used a definition of collaboration networks broader than the co-authorship relations retrievable from online datasets. We constructed a multilayer network, in which each layer represents a different kind of collaboration. After having analyzed the evolution over time of specific parameters of the co-authorship network, we investigated the effects of adding one type of collaboration edge at a time, in a cumulative fashion, on the values of these parameters and on the topology of the collaboration network through time, including rapid shifts in the dynamic evolution of the largest component. This analysis provides robust quantitative evidence that a shift in the structure of the relativity collaboration network occurred between the late 1950s and the early 1960s, when a giant component started forming. We interpret this shift as the central social dynamic of the renaissance process and then identify its central actors. Our analysis disproves common explanations of the renaissance process. It shows that this phenomenon was not a consequence of astrophysical discoveries in the 1960s, nor was it a simple by-product of socio-economic transformations in the physics landscape after World War II.

AB  - In this work, we study semi-supervised multi-label node classification problem in attributed graphs. Classic solutions to multi-label node classification follow two steps, first learn node embedding and then build a node classifier on the learned embedding. To improve the discriminating power of the node embedding, we propose a novel collaborative graph walk, named Multi-Label-Graph-Walk, to finely tune node representations with the available label assignments in attributed graphs via reinforcement learning. The proposed method formulates the multi-label node classification task as simultaneous graph walks conducted by multiple label-specific agents. Furthermore, policies of the label-wise graph walks are learned in a cooperative way to capture first the predictive relation between node labels and structural attributes of graphs; and second, the correlation among the multiple label-specific classification tasks. A comprehensive experimental study demonstrates that the proposed method can achieve significantly better multi-label classification performance than the state-of-the-art approaches and conduct more efficient graph exploration.

AB  - Abstract Dimensions was introduced as an alternative bibliometric database to the well-established Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus, however all three databases have fundamental differences in coverage and content, resultant from their owners’ indexation philosophies. In light of these differences, we explore here, using a citation network analysis and assessment of normalized citation impact of overlapping publications indexed in all three databases, whether the three databases offer structurally different perspectives of the bibliometric landscape or if they are essentially homogenous substitutes. Our citation network analysis of core and exclusive 2016–2018 publications revealed a large set of core publications indexed in all three databases that are highly self-referential. In comparison, each database selected a set of exclusive publications that appeared to hold similarly low levels of relevance to the core set and to one another, with slightly more internal communication between exclusive publications in Scopus and Dimensions than WoS. Our comparison of normalized citations for 41,848 publications indexed in all three databases found that German sectors were valuated as more impactful in Scopus and Dimensions compared to WoS, particularly for sectors with an applied research focus. We conclude that the databases do present structurally different perspectives, although Scopus and Dimensions with their additional circle of applied research vary more from the more base research-focused WoS than they do from one another.

AB  - Multi-label feature selection has received considerable attentions during the past decade. However, existing algorithms do not attempt to uncover the underlying causal mechanism, and individually solve different types of variable relationships, ignoring the mutual effects between them. Furthermore, these algorithms lack of interpretability, which can only select features for all labels, but cannot explain the correlation between a selected feature and a certain label. To address these problems, in this paper, we theoretically study the causal relationships in multi-label data, and propose a novel Markov blanket based multi-label causal feature selection (MB-MCF) algorithm. MB-MCF mines the causal mechanism of labels and features first, to obtain a complete representation of information about labels. Based on the causal relationships, MB-MCF then selects predictive features and simultaneously distinguishes common features shared by multiple labels and label-specific features owned by single labels. Experiments on real-world data sets validate that MB-MCF could automatically determine the number of selected features and simultaneously achieve the best performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. An experiment in Emotions data set further demonstrates the interpretability of MB-MCF.

AB  - Automated social text annotation is the task of suggesting a set of tags for shared documents on social media platforms.The automated annotation process can reduce users' cognitive overhead in tagging and improve tag management for better search, browsing, and recommendation of documents.It can be formulated as a multilabel classification problem.We propose a novel deep learning-based method for this problem and design an attention-based neural network with semantic-based regularization, which can mimic users' reading and annotation behavior to formulate better document representation, leveraging the semantic relations among labels.The network separately models the title and the content of each document and injects an explicit, title-guided attention mechanism into each sentence.To exploit the correlation among labels, we propose two semantic-based loss regularizers, i.e., similarity and subsumption, which enforce the output of the network to conform to label semantics.The model with the semantic-based loss regularizers is referred to as the joint multilabel attention network (JMAN).We conducted a comprehensive evaluation study and compared JMAN to the state-of-the-art baseline models, using four large, real-world social media data sets.In terms of F 1 , JMAN significantly outperformed bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) relatively by around 12.8%-78.6%and the hierarchical attention network (HAN) by around 3.9%-23.8%.The JMAN model demonstrates advantages in convergence and training speed.Further improvement of performance was observed against latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM).When applying the semantic-based loss regularizers, the performance of HAN and Bi-GRU in terms of F 1 was also boosted.It is also found that dynamic update of the label semantic matrices (JMAN d ) has

AB  - As more applications are being moved to the Cloud thanks to serverless computing, it is increasingly necessary to support the native life cycle execution of those applications in the data center. But existing cloud orchestration systems either focus on short-running workflows (like IBM Composer or Amazon Step Functions Express Workflows) or impose considerable overheads for synchronizing massively parallel jobs (Azure Durable Functions, Amazon Step Functions). None of them are open systems enabling extensible interception and optimization of custom workflows. We present Triggerflow: an extensible Trigger-based Orchestration architecture for serverless workflows. We demonstrate that Triggerflow is a novel serverless building block capable of constructing different reactive orchestrators (State Machines, Directed Acyclic Graphs, Workflow as code, Federated Learning orchestrator). We also validate that it can support high-volume event processing workloads, auto-scale on demand with scale down to zero when not used, and transparently guarantee fault tolerance and efficient resource usage when orchestrating long running scientific workflows.

AB  - G raph C onvolutional N etwork (GCN) has been commonly applied for semi-supervised learning tasks. However, the established GCN frequently only considers the given labels in the topology optimization, which may not deliver the best performance for semi-supervised learning tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel G raph C onvolutional N etwork with E stimated labels (E-GCN) for semi-supervised learning. The core design of E-GCN is to learn a suitable network topology for semi-supervised learning by linking both estimated labels and given labels in a centralized network framework. The major enhancement is that both given labels and estimated labels are utilized for the topology optimization in E-GCN, which assists the graph convolution implementation for unknown labels evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that E-GCN is significantly better than s tate-o f-t he-a rt (SOTA) baselines without estimated labels.

AB  - Abstract The study on which this article reports investigated the internationalisation of higher education studies by examining collaborations in the form of international co‐authorships. We analyse how network‐based mechanisms, related to structural relationship between authors (preferential attachment, i.e., higher tendency to collaborate among the most productive ones) and node level features (homophily, i.e., tendency to collaborate with similar others), affect higher education co‐authorship networks. We build a bipartite co‐authorship network based on 17,262 publications from 33 specialised higher education journals indexed in Scopus from 1996–2018. Scientific collaboration in higher education mainly occurs within national borders. We found that higher education is not an internationally oriented field of research, with around 90% single‐country publications. A geographical divide was observed between the two largest communities (Europe, Asia and Oceania vs. the Americas) which was also reflected in the research themes addressed by these communities, structured around the known divide between (1) learning and teaching, and (2) policy‐based studies. Preferential attachment was observed to be a network‐based mechanism that contributes to drive the formation of new co‐authorships. Similarly, homophily based on academic seniority and research productivity emerged as a significant explanatory mechanism. We present a methodology for disambiguating the names of higher education institutions. We demonstrate an associated effect on co‐authorship networks. Our research and analysis support the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - This article elaborates how to identify and evaluate causal factors to improve scientific impact. Currently, analyzing scientific impact can be beneficial to various academic activities including funding application, mentor recommendation, discovering potential cooperators, and the like. It is universally acknowledged that high-impact scholars often have more opportunities to receive awards as an encouragement for their hard work. Therefore, scholars spend great efforts in making scientific achievements and improving scientific impact during their academic life. However, what are the determinate factors that control scholars’ academic success? The answer to this question can help scholars conduct their research more efficiently. Under this consideration, our article presents and analyzes the causal factors that are crucial for scholars’ academic success. We first propose five major factors including article-centered factors, author-centered factors, venue-centered factors, institution-centered factors, and temporal factors. Then, we apply recent advanced machine learning algorithms and jackknife method to assess the importance of each causal factor. Our empirical results show that author-centered and article-centered factors have the highest relevancy to scholars’ future success in the computer science area. Additionally, we discover an interesting phenomenon that the h -index of scholars within the same institution or university are actually very close to each other.

AB  - Abstract Increasing evidence of women’s under-representation in some scientific disciplines is prompting researchers to expand our understanding of this social phenomenon. Moreover, any countermeasures proposed to eliminate this under-representation should be tailored to the actual reasons for this different participation. Here, we take a multi-dimensional approach to assessing gender differences in science by representing scientific communities as social networks, and using data analytics, complexity science methods, and semantic methods to measure gender differences in the context, the attitude and the success of scientists. We apply this approach to four scientific communities in the two fields of computer science and information systems using the network of authors at four different conferences. For each discipline, one conference is based in Italy and attracts mostly Italians, while one conference is international in both location and participants. The present paper provides evidence against common narratives that women’s under-representation is due to women’s limited skills and/or less social centrality.

AB  - Text classification is considered one of the most fundamental and essential problems that deal with automatically classifying textual resources into pre-defined categories.Numerous algorithms, datasets, and evaluation measurements have been proposed to address the task.Within the era of information redundancy, it is challenging and time-consuming to engineering a sizable amount of data in multi-languages manually.However, it is time-consuming to consider all words in a text, but rather several key tokens.In this work, the authors proposed an effective method to classify Vietnamese texts leveraging the TextRank algorithm and Jaccard similarity coefficient.TextRank ranks words and sentences according to their contribution value and extracts the most representative keywords.First, we collected textual sources from a wide range of Vietnamese news websites.We then applied data preprocessing, extracted keywords by TextRank algorithm, measured similarity score by Jaccard distance and predicted categories.The authors have conducted numerous experiments, and the proposed method has achieved an accuracy of 90.07% on real-world datasets.We have proved that it is entirely applicable in practice.

AB  - Adding to the literature on the recognition and spread of ideas, and alongside the bias against novelty view documented in prior research, we introduce the perspective that articles compete for the attention of researchers who might build upon them. We investigate this effect by analyzing more than 5.3 million research publications from 1970 to 1999 in the life sciences. In support of our competition for attention perspective, we show that articles covering rarely addressed topics tend to receive more citations and have a higher chance of being breakthrough papers as compared to articles on more popular topics. We also explore conditions under which these effects might vary by using decade subsamples, home- versus foreign-field forward citations, as well as short-, medium- and long-term time windows. Finally, we also find evidence consistent with the previously documented bias against novelty and show that both mechanisms can work simultaneously.

AB  - Citation plays an important role in the bibliometrics analysis since the introduction of the impact factors, but traditional measures mainly focused on the direct citations between articles. In this work, we introduce a new metric, namely Article Network Influence (ANI), to measure the influence of an article by using broader citation relationships quantitatively. We prepare our article citation networks from one of the largest citation databases called the Web of Science, and we demonstrate the use of ANI on the analysis of these networks in the statistics research community. These analyses appear in the top-20 influential articles in statistics within every 11 years during 1981-2016. We consider differences between the new metric and several traditional measures, including the impact factor, PageRank, and Field-Weighted Citation Impact (FWCI).

AB  - Since 1978, alongside China’s rise as a leading country in science, technology and innovation (STI), the studies of the country’s STI have been emerging as a field attracting increasing scholarly attention. Using the bibliometric method and the data from the Web of Science (WoS), this paper seeks to provide a comprehensive picture of the studies of China’s STI. The findings show that scholarly interests in China’s STI started in 1995 and have since developed rapidly; institutions in China, the U.S. and the U.K. are main contributors to the field, contributing 50%, 27.2% and 12% of the scholarship respectively, with Tsinghua University, Zhejiang University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences being three major institutional contributors. Seminal works have been focused on STI issues at the macro or national, meso or industrial and regional, and micro or organizational and firm levels. A possible agenda for further research is to develop new theories based on China’s practice paying specific attention to issues including R&D expenditure, S&T performance evaluation, regional innovation ecosystem, SOEs in innovation and the role of the Chinese Communist Party in innovation.

AB  - Abstract The science of science has attracted growing research interests, partly due to the increasing availability of large-scale datasets capturing the innerworkings of science. These datasets, and the numerous linkages among them, enable researchers to ask a range of fascinating questions about how science works and where innovation occurs. Yet as datasets grow, it becomes increasingly difficult to track available sources and linkages across datasets. Here we present SciSciNet, a large-scale open data lake for the science of science research, covering over 134M scientific publications and millions of external linkages to funding and public uses. We offer detailed documentation of pre-processing steps and analytical choices in constructing the data lake. We further supplement the data lake by computing frequently used measures in the literature, illustrating how researchers may contribute collectively to enriching the data lake. Overall, this data lake serves as an initial but useful resource for the field, by lowering the barrier to entry, reducing duplication of efforts in data processing and measurements, improving the robustness and replicability of empirical claims, and broadening the diversity and representation of ideas in the field.

AB  - The term “in situ processing” has evolved over the last decade to mean both a specific strategy for visualizing and analyzing data and an umbrella term for a processing paradigm. The resulting confusion makes it difficult for visualization and analysis scientists to communicate with each other and with their stakeholders. To address this problem, a group of over 50 experts convened with the goal of standardizing terminology. This paper summarizes their findings and proposes a new terminology for describing in situ systems. An important finding from this group was that in situ systems are best described via multiple, distinct axes: integration type, proximity, access, division of execution, operation controls, and output type. This paper discusses these axes, evaluates existing systems within the axes, and explores how currently used terms relate to the axes.

AB  - The Semantic Web emerged as an extension to the traditional Web, adding meaning (semantics) to a distributed Web of structured and linked information. At its core, the concept of ontology provides the means to semantically describe and structure information, and expose it to software and human agents in a machine and human-readable form. For software agents to be realized, it is crucial to develop powerful artificial intelligence and machine-learning techniques, able to extract knowledge from information sources, and represent it in the underlying ontology. This survey aims to provide insight into key aspects of ontology-based knowledge extraction from various sources such as text, databases, and human expertise, realized in the realm of feature selection. First, common classification and feature selection algorithms are presented. Then, selected approaches, which utilize ontologies to represent features and perform feature selection and classification, are described. The selective and representative approaches span diverse application domains, such as document classification, opinion mining, manufacturing, recommendation systems, urban management, information security systems, and demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of such methods. This survey, in addition to the criteria-based presentation of related works, contributes a number of open issues and challenges related to this still active research topic.

AB  - Forecasting is one of the methods applied in many studies in the library and information science (LIS) field for numerous purposes, from making predictions of the next Nobel laureates to potential technological developments. This study sought to draw a picture for the future of the LIS field and its sub-fields by analysing 97 years of publication and citation patterns. The core Web of Science indexes were used as the data source, and 123,742 articles were examined in-depth for time series analysis. The social network analysis method was used for sub-field classification. The field was divided into four sub-fields: (1) librarianship and law librarianship, (2) health information in LIS, (3) scientometrics and information retrieval and (4) management and information systems. The results of the study show that the LIS sub-fields are completely different from each other in terms of their publication and citation patterns, and all the sub-fields have different dynamics. Furthermore, the number of publications, references and citations will increase significantly in the future. It is expected that more scholars will work together. The future subjects of the LIS field show astonishing diversity from fake news to predatory journals, open government, e-learning and electronic health records. However, the findings prove that publish or perish culture will shape the field. Therefore, it is important to go beyond numbers. It can only be achieved by understanding publication and citation patterns of the field and developing research policies accordingly.

AB  - Linkages between science and technology have been extensively studied using nonpatent literature citations or author-inventor matching. These methods suffer from limitations, such as the lack of citations to relevant documents or challenges with the disambiguation of author–inventor linkages. To mitigate these limitations, this paper uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation to create topic-based linkages between publications and patents based on the semantic content in the documents. The approach allows for the detection of topical overlap between patent and scientific publications, highlighting topical areas shared by research and application. Using a case study on “Taxol,” a cancer drug, with in total 26 475 documents retrieved from EuropePMC database the study illustrates the performance of the approach. The study offers qualitative and quantitative support that the approach is valuable in detecting patent and publication linkages.

AB  - Abstract Single-label classification technology has difficulty meeting the needs of text classification, and multi-label text classification has become an important research issue in natural language processing (NLP). Extracting semantic features from different levels and granularities of text is a basic and key task in multi-label text classification research. A topic model is an effective method for the automatic organization and induction of text information. It can reveal the latent semantics of documents and analyze the topics contained in massive information. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-label text classification method based on tALBERT-CNN: an LDA topic model and ALBERT model are used to obtain the topic vector and semantic context vector of each word (document), a certain fusion mechanism is adopted to obtain in-depth topic and semantic representations of the document, and the multi-label features of the text are extracted through the TextCNN model to train a multi-label classifier. The experimental results obtained on standard datasets show that the proposed method can extract multi-label features from documents, and its performance is better than that of the existing state-of-the-art multi-label text classification algorithms.

AB  - In fields with high science linkage, such as the nanocarbon field, trends in academic papers are particularly important for identifying future technological trends. The use of the number of citations allows us to predict the qualitative trends on a paper-by-paper basis. At the same time, it is necessary to be able to comprehensively discuss both qualitative and quantitative aspects in the subject area. This study aimed to detect emerging areas in the nanocarbon field using network models and topic models. It was possible to not only construct a model that exceeded an 86.2% F1 measure but also to focus on an area that could not be detected by the prediction model. This was accomplished by focusing on paper units, such as the research on the chemical synthesis of zigzag single-walled carbon nanotubes. Thus, it is possible to obtain knowledge that contributes to diversified R&amp;D strategies and innovation policies by considering the emergence of new fields from multiple perspectives.

AB  - Implementing supervised machine learning on the Hindi corpus for classification and prediction of verses is an untouched and useful area. Classifying and predictions benefits many applications like organizing a large corpus, information retrieval and so on. The metalinguistic facility provided by websites makes Hindi as a major language in the digital domain of information technology today. Text classification algorithms along with Natural Language Processing (NLP) facilitates fast, cost-effective, and scalable solution. Performance evaluation of these predictors is a challenging task. To reduce manual efforts and time spent for reading the document, classification of text data is important. In this paper, 697 Hindi poems are classified based on four topics using four eager machine-learning algorithms. In the absence of any other technique, which achieves prediction on Hindi corpus, misclassification error is used and compared to prove the betterment of the technique. Support vector machine performs best amongst all.

AB  - The increasingly available large-scale bibliographic data that generate a heterogeneous network provide opportunities to detect, track, and predict the evolution of science.Recently, many efforts have been devoted to quantifying the impact of scientific papers within different citation time windows.However, the complex patterns of the citation network make it difficult to predict future citations on the basis of a short time window.Accordingly, we present a data-centric methodology to predict long-term scientific impact by combining numerous bibliographic features and convolutional neural network.More specifically, we first expand the input features from the annual citation records to the features of the whole heterogeneous bibliographic information network that completely represents the topology structure of academic activities.Then, a convolutional neural network model is designed to capture the complex nonlinear relationships between the early network features and the final cumulative citation count.Finally, we conduct an experiment on papers of Markov Chain from 1980 to 1985.The result shows that the prediction performance can be improved by 5% to baseline models under the same problem definition and with the same dataset.Meanwhile, the long-term scientific impacts are strongly correlated with its recognition by authoritative authors or venues in the early stage.

AB  - In the next decade the pressures on ocean systems and the communities that rely on them will increase as multiple stressors of climate change, food security and human activities start to impact. Our ability to manage and sustain our oceans will depend on the data we collect and the information and knowledge generated. Much of the uptake of this knowledge will be outside the ocean domain, for example by policy makers, local Governments, custodians and other organizations, so it is imperative that we democratize or open the access and use of ocean data. This paper looks at how technologies, scoped by standards, best practice and communities of practice, can be deployed to change the way that ocean data is accessed, utilized, value added and transformed into information and knowledge. The current portal-download model which requires the user to know what data exists, where it is stored, in what format and with what processing, limits the uptake and use of ocean data. Using examples from a range of disciplines, a web services model of data and information flows is presented. A framework is described, including the systems, processes and human components, which delivers a radical rethink about the delivery of knowledge from ocean data. A series of vision statements describe parts of the future vision along with a series of recommendations about how this may be achieved. The paper recommends the development of virtual test-beds for end to end development of new data workflows and knowledge pathways. This supports the continued development, rationalization and uptake of standards, creates a platform around which a community of practice can be developed, promotes cross discipline engagement from ocean science through to ocean policy, allows for the commercial sector, including the informatics sector, to partner in delivering outcomes and provides a focus to leverage long term sustained funding. The next ten years will be ‘make or break’ for many ocean systems. The decadal challenge is to develop the governance and co-operative mechanisms to harness emerging information technology to deliver on the goal of generating the information and knowledge required to sustain oceans into the future.

AB  - The effective evaluation of the impact of a scholarly article is a significant endeavor; for this reason, it has garnered attention. From the perspective of knowledge flow, this paper extracted various knowledge flow patterns concealed in articles citation counts to describe the citation impact of the articles. First, the intensity characteristic of knowledge flow was investigated to distinguish the different citation vitality of articles. Second, the knowledge diffusion capacity was examined to differentiate the size of the scope of articles’ influences on the academic environment. Finally, the knowledge transfer capacity was discussed to investigate the support degree of articles on the follow-up research. Experimental results show that articles got more citations recently have a higher knowledge flow intensity. The articles have various impacts on the academic environment and have different supporting effects on the follow-up research, representing the differences in their knowledge diffusion and knowledge transfer capabilities. Compared with the single quantitative index of citation frequency, these knowledge flow patterns can carefully explore the citation value of articles. By integrating the three knowledge flow patterns to examine the total citation impact of articles, we found that the articles exhibit distinct value of citation impact even if they were published in the same field, in the same year, and with similar citation frequencies.

AB  - Label embedding has been widely used as a method to exploit label dependency with dimension reduction in multilabel classification tasks. However, existing embedding methods intend to extract label correlations directly, and thus they might be easily trapped by complex label hierarchies. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Two-Stage Label Embedding (TSLE) paradigm that involves Neural Factorization Machine (NFM) to jointly project features and labels into a latent space. In encoding phase, we introduce a Twin Encoding Network (TEN) that digs out pairwise feature and label interactions in the first stage and then efficiently learn higherorder correlations with deep neural networks (DNNs) in the second stage. After the codewords are obtained, a set of hidden layers is applied to recover the output labels in decoding phase. Moreover, we develop a novel learning model by leveraging a max margin encoding loss and a label-correlation aware decoding loss, and we adopt the mini-batch Adam to optimize our learning model. Lastly, we also provide a kernel insight to better understand our proposed TSLE. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms other state-ofthe-art approaches.

AB  - Science maps are visual representations of the structure and dynamics of scholarly knowl­edge. They aim to show how fields, disciplines, journals, scientists, publications, and scientific terms relate to each other. Science mapping is the body of methods and techniques that have been developed for generating science maps. This entry is an introduction to science maps and science mapping. It focuses on the conceptual, theoretical, and methodological issues of science mapping, rather than on the mathematical formulation of science mapping techniques. After a brief history of science mapping, we describe the general procedure for building a science map, presenting the data sources and the methods to select, clean, and pre-process the data. Next, we examine in detail how the most common types of science maps, namely the citation-based and the term-based, are generated. Both are based on networks: the former on the network of publications connected by citations, the latter on the network of terms co-occurring in publications. We review the rationale behind these mapping approaches, as well as the techniques and methods to build the maps (from the extraction of the network to the visualization and enrichment of the map). We also present less-common types of science maps, including co-authorship networks, interlocking editorship networks, maps based on patents’ data, and geographic maps of science. Moreover, we consider how time can be represented in science maps to investigate the dynamics of science. We also discuss some epistemological and sociological topics that can help in the interpretation, contextualization, and assessment of science maps. Then, we present some possible applications of science maps in science policy. In the conclusion, we point out why science mapping may be interesting for all the branches of meta-science, from knowl­edge organization to epistemology.

AB  - Abstract Contextual information is widely considered for NLP and knowledge discovery in life sciences since it highly influences the exact meaning of natural language. The scientific challenge is not only to extract such context data, but also to store this data for further query and discovery approaches. Classical approaches use RDF triple stores, which have serious limitations. Here, we propose a multiple step knowledge graph approach using labeled property graphs based on polyglot persistence systems to utilize context data for context mining, graph queries, knowledge discovery and extraction. We introduce the graph-theoretic foundation for a general context concept within semantic networks and show a proof of concept based on biomedical literature and text mining. Our test system contains a knowledge graph derived from the entirety of PubMed and SCAIView data and is enriched with text mining data and domain-specific language data using Biological Expression Language. Here, context is a more general concept than annotations. This dense graph has more than 71M nodes and 850M relationships. We discuss the impact of this novel approach with 27 real-world use cases represented by graph queries. Storing and querying a giant knowledge graph as a labeled property graph is still a technological challenge. Here, we demonstrate how our data model is able to support the understanding and interpretation of biomedical data. We present several real-world use cases that utilize our massive, generated knowledge graph derived from PubMed data and enriched with additional contextual data. Finally, we show a working example in context of biologically relevant information using SCAIView.

AB  - Important changes have characterised research and knowledge production in recent decades. These changes are associated with developments in information technologies and infrastructures. The processes characterising research and knowledge production are changing through the digitalisation of science, the virtualisation of research communities and networks, the offering of underlying systems and services by infrastructures. This paper gives an overview of gCube, a software system promoting elastic and seamless access to research assets (data, services, computing) across the boundaries of institutions, disciplines and providers to favour collaboration-oriented research tasks. gCube’s technology is primarily conceived to enable Hybrid Data Infrastructures facilitating the dynamic definition and operation of Virtual Research Environments. To this end, it offers a comprehensive set of data management commodities on various types of data and a rich array of “mediators” to interface well-established Infrastructures and Information Systems from various domains. Its effectiveness has been proved by operating the D4Science.org infrastructure and serving concrete, multidisciplinary, challenging, and large scale scenarios.

AB  - Abstract Large publishing companies have been dominating scientific publishing for long, which leads to high subscription fees and inhibited access to scientific knowledge. At digital era, the opportunity of an unrestricted access appears feasible, because the cost of publishing should be low. It is no longer the readers and libraries to pay subscription fees, but scientific organizations and authors themselves who pay for the cost of having their article published. As the data shows, there is a tremendous variance of article processing charges (APC) across journals, which obviously cannot be explained by the costs. One of the explanatory variables could be reputation, but it only contributes less than 5% to the variance in average APC. This study is meant to shed light on the various determinants of APC. Based on the data from the OpenAPC Initiative, the Directory of Open Access Journals and three different datasets of Web of Science, we employ ANOVAs and multivariate regressions. The results show that market power plays an important role to explain APC, inter alia, through market concentration, market position of individual publishers (publisher size), and the choice of hybrid publishing model.

AB  - Difficulties in collecting, processing, and identifying massive data have slowed research on cutting-edge science and technology hotspots. Promoting these technologies will not be successful without an effective data-driven method to identify cutting-edge technologies. This paper proposes a data-driven model for identifying global cutting-edge science technologies based on SpaCy. In this model, we collected data released by 17 well-known American technology media websites from July 2019 to July 2020 using web crawling with Python. We combine graph-based neural network learning with active learning as the research method in this paper. Next, we introduced a ten-fold cross-check to train the model through machine learning with repeated experiments. The experimental results show that this model performed very well in entity recognition tasks with an F value of 98.11%. The model provides an information source for cutting-edge technology identification. It can promote innovations in cutting-edge technologies through its effective identification and tracking and explore more efficient scientific and technological research work modes.

AB  - Abstract Evaluating the impact of papers, researchers and venues objectively is of great significance to academia and beyond. This may help researchers, research organizations, and government agencies in various ways, such as helping researchers find valuable papers and authoritative venues and helping research organizations identify good researchers. A few studies find that rather than treating citations equally, differentiating them is a promising way for impact evaluation of academic entities. However, most of those methods are metadata-based only and do not consider contents of cited and citing papers; while a few content-based methods are not sophisticated, and further improvement is possible. In this paper, we study the citation relationships between entities by content-based approaches. Especially, an ensemble learning method is used to classify citations into different strength types, and a word-embedding based method is used to estimate topical similarity of the citing and cited papers. A heterogeneous network is constructed with the weighted citation links and several other features. Based on the heterogeneous network that consists of three types of entities, we apply an iterative PageRank-like method to rank the impact of papers, authors and venues at the same time through mutual reinforcement. Experiments are conducted on an ACL dataset, and the results demonstrate that our method greatly outperforms state-of-the art competitors in improving ranking effectiveness of papers, authors and venues, as well as in being robust against malicious manipulation of citations.

AB  - We study the evolution of topics in economics and their geographical specialization by analyzing 13,233 papers from seven top journals between 1985 and 2012 and their forward citations. The share of U.S. publications declines from 75% to 64% with a corresponding increase of the European share from 12% to 24%. We use topic modeling and document the evolution of the discipline over 27 years. We estimate, with a quasi‐structural model, the citation lag distribution for 18 different topics and three large geographical areas. The modal citation lag is about 6.7 years in the entire sample and 4.8 years for citations from the top 100 journals. We quantify (1) the home bias effect in citations, (2) how it fades away over time, (3) the long lasting impact of U.S. publications vis‐à‐vis other geographical areas, and (4) the higher speed of diffusion and faster obsolescence in the United States.

AB  - In multi-view multi-label learning, each object is represented by multiple data views, and belongs to multiple class labels simultaneously. Generally, all the data views have a contribution to the multi-label learning task, but their contributions are different. Besides, for each data view, each class label is only associated with a subset data features, and different features have different contributions to each class label. In this paper, we propose a novel framework VLSF for multi-view multi-label learning, i.e., multi-view multi-label learning with View-Label-Specific Features. Specifically, we first learn a low dimensional label-specific data representation for each data view and construct a multi-label classification model based on it by exploiting label correlations and view consensus, and learn the contribution weight of each data view to multi-label learning task for all the class labels jointly. Then, the final prediction can be made by combing the prediction results of all the classifiers and the learned contribution weights. The extensive comparison experiments with the state-of-the-art approaches manifest the effectiveness of the proposed method VLSF.

AB  - Abstract This work explores the role of university department characteristics in academic engagement with industry. In particular, we investigate the role played by research quality and previous experience in academic engagement across different scientific disciplines. We test our hypotheses on a dataset of public sponsored university-industry partnerships in the United Kingdom, combined with data from the UK Research Assessment Exercises 2001 and 2008. Our analysis reveals a negative link between academic quality and the level of engagement with industry for departments in the basic sciences and a positive relationship for departments in the applied sciences. Our results further show that the role of research quality for academic engagement strictly depends on the level of the department’s previous experience in university-industry partnerships, notably in the basic sciences, where experience acts as a moderating factor. The findings of this work are highly relevant for policy makers and university managers and contribute to the innovation literature focused on the investigation of the determinants of valuable knowledge transfer practices in academia.

AB  - Feature embedding aims to learn a low-dimensional vector representation for each instance to preserve the information in its features. These representations can benefit various offthe-shelf learning algorithms. While embedding models for a single type of features have been well-studied, real-world instances often contain multiple types of correlated features or even information within a different modality such as networks. Existing studies such as multiview learning show that it is promising to learn unified vector representations from all sources. However, high computational costs of incorporating heterogeneous information limit the applications of existing algorithms. The number of instances and dimensions of features in practice are often large. To bridge the gap, we propose a scalable framework FeatWalk, which can model and incorporate instance similarities in terms of different types of features into a unified embedding representation. To enable the scalability, FeatWalk does not directly calculate any similarity measure, but provides an alternative way to simulate the similarity-based random walks among instances to extract the local instance proximity and preserve it in a set of instance index sequences. These sequences are homogeneous with each other. A scalable word embedding algorithm is applied to them to learn a joint embedding representation of instances. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of FeatWalk.

AB  - Multilabel classification is an emergent data mining task with a broad range of real world applications. Learning from imbalanced multilabel data is being deeply studied latterly, and several resampling methods have been proposed in the literature. The unequal label distribution in most multilabel datasets, with disparate imbalance levels, could be a handicap while learning new classifiers. In addition, this characteristic challenges many of the existent preprocessing algorithms. Furthermore, the concurrence between imbalanced labels can make harder the learning from certain labels. These are what we call \textit{difficult} labels. In this work, the problem of difficult labels is deeply analyzed, its influence in multilabel classifiers is studied, and a novel way to solve this problem is proposed. Specific metrics to assess this trait in multilabel datasets, called \textit{SCUMBLE} (\textit{Score of ConcUrrence among iMBalanced LabEls}) and \textit{SCUMBLELbl}, are presented along with REMEDIAL (\textit{REsampling MultilabEl datasets by Decoupling highly ImbAlanced Labels}), a new algorithm aimed to relax label concurrence. How to deal with this problem using the R mldr package is also outlined.

AB  - Searching, retrieving, and arranging text in ever-larger document collections necessitate more efficient information processing algorithms. Document categorization is a crucial component of various information processing systems for supervised learning. As the quantity of documents grows, the performance of classic supervised classifiers has deteriorated because of the number of document categories. Assigning documents to a predetermined set of classes is called text classification. It is utilized extensively in a wide range of data-intensive applications. However, the fact that real-world implementations of these models are plagued with shortcomings begs for more investigation. Imbalanced datasets hinder the most prevalent high-performance algorithms. In this paper, we propose an approach name multi-class Convolutional Neural Network (MCNN)-Long Short-Time Memory (LSTM), which combines two deep learning techniques, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Time Memory, for text classification in news data. CNN’s are used as feature extractors for the LSTMs on text input data and have the spatial structure of words in a sentence, paragraph, or document. The dataset is also imbalanced, and we use the Tomek-Link algorithm to balance the dataset and then apply our model, which shows better performance in terms of F1-score (98%) and Accuracy (99.71%) than the existing works. The combination of deep learning techniques used in our approach is ideal for the classification of imbalanced datasets with underrepresented categories. Hence, our method outperformed other machine learning algorithms in text classification by a large margin. We also compare our results with traditional machine learning algorithms in terms of imbalanced and balanced datasets.

AB  - Recently, deep neural networks have expanded the state-of-art in various scientific fields and provided solutions to long standing problems across multiple application domains. Nevertheless, they also suffer from weaknesses since their optimal performance depends on massive amounts of training data and the tuning of an extended number of parameters. As a countermeasure, some deep-forest methods have been recently proposed, as efficient and low-scale solutions. Despite that, these approaches simply employ label classification probabilities as induced features and primarily focus on traditional classification and regression tasks, leaving multi-output prediction under-explored. Moreover, recent work has demonstrated that tree-embeddings are highly representative, especially in structured output prediction. In this direction, we propose a novel deep tree-ensemble (DTE) model, where every layer enriches the original feature set with a representation learning component based on tree-embeddings. In this paper, we specifically focus on two structured output prediction tasks, namely multi-label classification and multi-target regression. We conducted experiments using multiple benchmark datasets and the obtained results confirm that our method provides superior results to state-of-the-art methods in both tasks.

AB  - Modern applications of Big Data are transcending from being scalable solutions of data processing and analysis, to now provide advanced functionalities with the ability to exploit and understand the underpinning knowledge. This change is promoting the development of tools in the intersection of data processing, data analysis, knowledge extraction and management. In this paper, we propose TITAN, a software platform for managing all the life cycle of science workflows from deployment to execution in the context of Big Data applications. This platform is characterised by a design and operation mode driven by semantics at different levels: data sources, problem domain and workflow components. The proposed platform is developed upon an ontological framework of meta-data consistently managing processes and models and taking advantage of domain knowledge. TITAN comprises a well-grounded stack of Big Data technologies including Apache Kafka for inter-component communication, Apache Avro for data serialisation and Apache Spark for data analytics. A series of use cases are conducted for validation, which comprises workflow composition and semantic meta-data management in academic and real-world fields of human activity recognition and land use monitoring from satellite images.

AB  - Feature augmentation, which manipulates the feature space by integrating the label information, is one of the most popular strategies for solving Multi-Dimensional Classification (MDC) problems. However, the vanilla feature augmentation approaches fail to consider the intra-class exclusiveness, and may achieve degenerated performance. To fill this gap, a novel neural network based model is proposed which seamlessly integrates the Label Embedding and Feature Augmentation (LEFA) techniques to learn label correlations. Specifically, based on attentional factorization machine, a cross correlation aware network is introduced to learn a low-dimensional label representation that simultaneously depicts the inter-class correlations and the intra-class exclusiveness. Then the learned latent label vector can be used to augment the original feature space. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of LEFA over state-of-the-art MDC approaches.

AB  - Melanoma, a lethal form of skin cancer, poses a significant risk to global health if not detected and treated promptly.Its early detection is pivotal in increasing the likelihood of successful treatment and patient survival.However, the accurate diagnosis of melanoma remains a challenge, even for seasoned dermatologists.Consequently, there has been a growing interest in leveraging Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to augment the accuracy of melanoma diagnosis.Typically, melanoma is identified through dermoscopic imaging.Numerous previous studies have proposed the automated analysis of skin lesions using both traditional classification techniques and deep learning models.These analyses often involve the feeding of designed functions into traditional categorization systems.Nonetheless, the high visual similarity between different skin lesion types and the complexity of skin diseases often renders manual features insufficiently discriminative, leading to failure in various scenarios.Recent research suggests that convolutional networks with short connections between layers near the input and the output can be deeper, more precise, and more efficient in training.This paper adopts this approach and introduces the application of Hadoop's HdiDenseNet techniques.DenseNets offer several notable advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, enhance feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters.The performance of our proposed architecture is evaluated against four highly competitive benchmark object identification challenges using a dataset comprising over 40,000 images sourced diversely.The results demonstrate that the most effective method is a densely connected distributed convolutional network, particularly when applied to patient metadata.Ultimately, this paper aims to contribute to the field of medical image analysis and potentially enhance the accuracy of melanoma diagnosis.By doing so, it could play a crucial role in improving patient prognosis and saving lives.

AB  - The wide adoption of media and social media has increased the amount of digital content to an enormous level. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques provide an opportunity to extract and explore meaningful information from a large amount of text. Among natural languages, Urdu is one of the widely used languages worldwide for spoken and written communications. Due to its wide adopt-ability, digital content in the Urdu language is increasing briskly, especially with social media and online NEWS feeds. Government agencies and advertisers must filter and understand the content to analyze the trends and cohorts in their interest and national prerogative. Clustering is considered a baseline and one of the first steps in natural language understanding. There are many state-of-the-art clustering techniques specifically for English, French, and Arabic, but no significant research has been conducted in Urdu language processing. Doing it for short text segments is challenging because of limited features and the absence of meaningful language discourse and nuance. Many rule-based NLP techniques are adopted to overcome these issues, relying on human-designed features and rules. Therefore, these methods do not promise remarkable results. Alongside NLP, deep learning techniques are pretty efficient in capturing contextual information with minimal noise compared to other traditional methods. By taking on this challenging job, we develop a deep learning-based technique for Urdu short text clustering for the very first time without a human-designed feature. In this paper, we propose a method of short text clustering using a deep neural network that automatically learns feature representations and clustering assignments simultaneously. This method learns clustering objectives by converting the high dimensional feature space to a low dimensional feature space. Our experiments on the Urdu NEWS headlines dataset show remarkable results compared to state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - News media always pursue informing the public at large. It is impossible to overestimate the significance of understanding the semantics of news coverage. Traditionally, a news text is assigned to a single category; however, a piece of news may contain information from more than one domain. A multi-label text classification model for news is proposed in this paper. The proposed model is an automated expert system designed to optimize CNN’s classification of multi-label news items. The performance of a CNN is highly dependent on its hyperparameters, and manually tweaking their values is a cumbersome and inefficient task. A high-level metaheuristic optimization algorithm, spotted hyena optimizer (SHO), has higher advanced exploration and exploitation capabilities. SHO generates a collection of solutions as a group of hyperparameters to be optimized, and the process is repeated until the desired optimal solution is achieved. SHO is integrated to automate the tuning of the hyperparameters of a CNN, including learning rate, momentum, number of epochs, batch size, dropout, number of nodes, and activation function. Four publicly available news datasets are used to evaluate the proposed model. The tuned hyperparameters and higher convergence rate of the proposed model result in higher performance for multi-label news classification compared to a baseline CNN and other optimizations of CNNs. The resulting accuracies are 93.6%, 90.8%, 68.7%, and 95.4% for RCV1-v2, Reuters-21578, Slashdot, and NELA-GT-2019, respectively.

AB  - Along with the large and increasing number of scientific workflows publicly accessible on Web repositories, the discovery of workflow fragments is significant to promote the reuse or repurposing of best-practices evidenced in legacy workflows, when novel scientific experiments are to be conducted. This paper proposes a novel crossing-workflow fragment discovery mechanism, where an activity knowledge graph is constructed to capture flat invocation relations between activities, and hierarchical parent–child relations specified upon sub-workflows and their corresponding activities. Semantic relevance of activities and sub-workflows is calculated based on their representative topics, where these topics are generated by applying the biterm topic model. Given a requirement specified in terms of a workflow fragment template, individual candidate activities or sub-workflows are discovered when considering their semantic relevance and short-document descriptions. Candidate fragments are constructed through discovering the relations in activity knowledge graph specified upon candidate activities or sub-workflows. These fragments are evaluated by balancing their structural and semantic similarities. Evaluation results show that our approach is accurate in discovering appropriate crossing-workflow fragments in comparison with the state of art's techniques.

AB  - This paper introduces an open-source platform to support serverless computing for scientific data-processing workflow-based applications across the Cloud continuum (i.e. simultaneously involving both on-premises and public Cloud platforms to process data captured at the edge). This is achieved via dynamic resource provisioning for FaaS platforms compatible with scale-to-zero approaches that minimise resource usage and cost for dynamic workloads with different elasticity requirements. The platform combines the usage of dynamically deployed auto-scaled Kubernetes clusters on on-premises Clouds and automated Cloud bursting into AWS Lambda to achieve higher levels of elasticity. A use case in public health for smart cities is used to assess the platform, in charge of detecting people not wearing face masks from captured videos. Faces are blurred for enhanced anonymity in the on-premises Cloud and detection via Deep Learning models is performed in AWS Lambda for this data-driven containerised workflow. The results indicate that hybrid workflows across the Cloud continuum can efficiently perform local data processing for enhanced regulations compliance and perform Cloud bursting for increased levels of elasticity.

AB  - As the size of the document collections are increasing day-by-day, finding an essential document clusters for classification problem is one of the major problem due to high inter and intra document variations. Also, most of the conventional classification models such as SVM, neural network and Bayesian models have high true negative rate and error rate for document classification process. In order to improve the computational efficacy of the traditional document classification models, a hybrid feature extraction-based document cluster approach and classification approaches are developed on the large document sets. In the proposed work, a hybrid glove feature selection model is proposed to improve the contextual similarity of the keywords in the large document corpus. In this work, a hybrid document clustering similarity index is optimized to find the essential key document clusters based on the contextual keywords. Finally, a hybrid document classification model is used to classify the clustered documents on large corpus. Experimental results are conducted on different datasets, it is noted that the proposed document clustering-based classification model has high true positive rate, accuracy and low error rate than the conventional models.

AB  - Abstract Finding new ways to help researchers and administrators understand academic fields is an important task for information scientists. Given the importance of interdisciplinary research, it is essential to be aware of disciplinary differences in aspects of scholarship, such as the significance of recent changes in a field. This paper identifies potential changes in 25 subject categories through a term comparison of words in article titles, keywords and abstracts in 1 year compared to the previous 4 years. The scholarly influence of new research issues is indirectly assessed with a citation analysis of articles matching each trending term. While topic‐related words dominate the top terms, style, national focus, and language changes are also evident. Thus, as reflected in Scopus, fields evolve along multiple dimensions. Moreover, while articles exploiting new issues are usually more cited in some fields, such as Organic Chemistry, they are usually less cited in others, including History. The possible causes of new issues being less cited include externally driven temporary factors, such as disease outbreaks, and internally driven temporary decisions, such as a deliberate emphasis on a single topic (e.g., through a journal special issue).

AB  - In this study, we design, develop, implement and test an analytical framework and measurement model to detect scientific discoveries with 'breakthrough' characteristics. To do so, we have developed a series of computerised search algorithms that data mine large quantities of research publications. These algorithms facilitate early-stage detection of 'breakout' papers that emerge as highly cited and distinctive and are considered to be potential breakthroughs. Combining computer-aided data mining with decision heuristics, enabled us to assess structural changes within citation patterns with the international scientific literature. In our case studies, we applied a citation impact time window of 24–36 months after publication of each research paper. In this paper, we report on our test results, in which five algorithms were applied to the entire Web of Science database. We analysed the citation impact patterns of all research articles from the period 1990–1994. We succeeded in detecting many papers with distinctive impact profiles (breakouts). A small subset of these breakouts is classified as 'breakthroughs': Nobel Prize research papers; papers occurring in Nature's Top-100 Most Cited Papers Ever; papers still (highly) cited by review papers or patents; or those frequently mentioned in today's social media. We also compare the outcomes of our algorithms with the results of a 'baseline' detection algorithm developed by Redner in 2005, which selects the world's most highly cited 'hot papers'. The detection rates of the algorithms vary, but overall, they present a powerful tool for tracing breakout papers in science. The wider applicability of these algorithms, across all science fields, has not yet been ascertained. Whether or not our early-stage breakout papers present a 'breakthrough' remains a matter of opinion, where input from subject experts is needed for verification and confirmation, but our detection approach certain helps to limit the search domain to trace and track important emerging topics in science.

AB  - Recommendation system is an important type of machine learning algorithm that provide precise suggestions to the users. Recommendation systems are used in innumerable types of areas such as generation of playlists, music and video services like Jio savaan, wynk, amazon prime music etc., and products recommendation for users in e-commerce applications and commercial applications. The recommendations that are provided by various types of applications increases the speed for identifying and makes easier to access the products that users are interested in. For each user, the recommendation system is capable of envisaging the future predilections on a set of items and recommend the top items. In several industries, recommendation systems are very useful as they generate huge amount of income and this type of industries can stand uniquely from competitors. Due to cumbersome number of items that each user can find in the web, the impact of recommendation system has been increased in the internet. Recommendation systems are used for custom-made navigation by getting huge amount of data particularly in social media domain for recommending friends. A recommendation system act as a subclass for the information filtering system that pursue to predict the rating. The similarity measures that are calculated in this research are Jaccard distance and Otsuka-Ochiai coefficient. The feature extractions that are used in this paper are Adar index, PageRank, Katz centrality, Hits score. Now a days many research people are implementing different types of algorithms in various domains for recommendation systems.

AB  - Abstract For short text classification, insufficient labeled data, data sparsity, and imbalanced classification have become three major challenges. For this, we proposed multiple weak supervision, which can label unlabeled data automatically. Different from prior work, the proposed method can generate probabilistic labels through conditional independent model. What’s more, experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of multiple weak supervision. According to experimental results on public dadasets, real datasets and synthetic datasets, unlabeled imbalanced short text classification problem can be solved effectively by multiple weak supervision. Notably, without reducing precision , recall , and F1-score can be improved by adding distant supervision clustering, which can be used to meet different application needs.

AB  - The world has witnessed an information explosion in the past two decades. Electronic devices are now available in many varieties such as PCs, Laptops, book readers, mobile devices and with relatively affordable prices. This and the ubiquitous use of software applications such as social media and cloud applications, and the increasing trend towards digitalization, the amount of information on the global cloud has surged to an unprecedented level. Therefore, a dire need exists in order to mine this massively large amount of data and produce meaningful information. Text Classification is one of the known and well established data mining techniques that has been used and reported in the literature. Text classification methods include statistical and machine learning algorithms such as Naive Baysian, Support Vector Machines and others have widely been used. Many works have been reported regarding text classification of various languages including English, Chinese, Russian, and many others. Arabic is the fifth most spoken language in the world. There has been many works in the literature for Arabic text classification. However, and to the best of our knowledge, there is no recent work that presents a good, critical and comprehensive survey of the Arabic text classification for the past two decades. The aim of this paper is to present a concise and yet comprehensive review of the Arabic text classification. We have covered over 50 research papers covering the past two decades (2000 - 2019). The main focus of this paper is to address the following issues: 1) The techniques reported in the literature including. 2) New Techniques. 3) Most claimed efficient technique. 4) Datasets used and which ones are most popular. 5) Which feature selection techniques are used? 6) Popular classes/categories used. 7) Effect of stemming techniques on classification results.

AB  - As a novel learning paradigm, label distribution learning (LDL) explicitly models label ambiguity with the definition of label description degree. Although lots of work has been done to deal with real-world applications, theoretical results on LDL remain unexplored. In this paper, we rethink LDL from theoretical aspects, towards analyzing learnability of LDL. Firstly, risk bounds for three representative LDL algorithms (AA-kNN, AA-BP and SA-ME) are provided. For AA-kNN, Lipschitzness of the label distribution function is assumed to bound the risk, and for AA-BP and SA-ME, rademacher complexity is utilized to give data-dependent risk bounds. Secondly, a generalized plug-in decision theorem is proposed to understand the relation between LDL and classification, uncovering that approximation to the conditional probability distribution function in absolute loss guarantees approaching to the optimal classifier, and also data-dependent error probability bounds are presented for the corresponding LDL algorithms to perform classification. As far as we know, this is perhaps the first research on theory of LDL.

AB  - Although previous studies on human resource management (HRM) research trends in the global context provided very useful information about the structures of HRM research trends, they have critical limitations. Despite the growing contribution and significance of HRM practices in Korea, a dominant group of scholars has rarely focused on what is going on in the research community in the country. To overcome the limitations and fill the gaps found in studies on the global HRM trends, the purpose of this study is to conduct the keyword network analysis investigating the semantic network structure composed of Korean HRM studies. A total of 1158 research papers published by three top peer-reviewed HRM journals in Korea that were published from 2007 to 2018 were analyzed. The result shows that the whole network structure of Korean HRM has a complex semantic structure that is socially constructed. Additionally, this study identified the top 10 prominent keywords and its ego-centric networks, and nine thematic clusters. By adopting keywords network analysis in bibliometric methods, this study provides an accurate structural interpretation of Korean HRM research practice to facilitate the sustainable development of the studies on the global HRM trends.

AB  - Abstract The citation graph is a computational artifact that is widely used to represent the domain of published literature. It represents connections between published works, such as citations and authorship. Among other things, the graph supports the computation of bibliometric measures such as h-indexes and impact factors. There is now an increasing demand that we should treat the publication of data in the same way that we treat conventional publications. In particular, we should cite data for the same reasons that we cite other publications. In this paper we discuss what is needed for the citation graph to represent data citation. We identify two challenges: to model the evolution of credit appropriately (through references) over time and to model data citation not only to a data set treated as a single object but also to parts of it. We describe an extension of the current citation graph model that addresses these challenges. It is built on two central concepts: citable units and reference subsumption. We discuss how this extension would enable data citation to be represented within the citation graph and how it allows for improvements in current practices for bibliometric computations, both for scientific publications and for data.

AB  - Abstract To overcome obstacles and complexity of decision making in clinical oncology, we propose an integrated clinical decision support approach; the Digital Twin. We analyse the reasons for frustration in applying clinical decision support and provide a multi-levelled approach to implementing a flexible system to support and strengthen clinical decisions. Describing medical patterns and contexts with Resource Description Framework (RDF) allows for standardised way of connecting medical knowledge and processing modules. Having flexible web-based interfaces integrated a multitude of heterogeneous data processing systems to either make clinical data available altogether, or provide calculations and assessments. Transition of the Digital Twin to clinical practice promises effective assistance and safer clinical decisions.

AB  - Abstract The Fields Medal, often referred as the Nobel Prize of mathematics, is awarded to no more than four mathematicians under the age of 40, every 4 years. In recent years, its conferral has come under scrutiny of math historians, for rewarding the existing elite rather than its original goal of elevating under-represented mathematicians. Prior studies of elitism focus on citational practices while a characterization of the structural forces that prevent access remain unclear. Here we show the flow of elite mathematicians between countries and lingo-ethnic identity, using network analysis and natural language processing on 240,000 mathematicians and their advisor–advisee relationships. We present quantitative evidence of how the Fields Medal helped integrate Japan after WWII, through analysis of the elite circle formed around Fields Medalists. We show increases in pluralism among major countries, though Arabic, African, and East Asian identities remain under-represented at the elite level. Our results demonstrate concerted efforts by academic committees, such as prize giving, can either reinforce the existing elite or reshape its definition. We anticipate our methodology of academic genealogical analysis can serve as a useful diagnostic for equity and systemic bias within academic fields.

AB  - The dissemination of extremist ideas and causes online has intensified over the last decade. Extremist organizations use social media to gain publicity and new recruits, often with little interference from network providers. New techniques are being developed to identify extremist content, ensuring it can be promptly removed and its authors blocked from network access. However, most techniques are only compatible with the English language, despite the fact that extremist propaganda is frequently shared in other languages, including Arabic. Since the most effective methods for automated linguistic analysis use deep learning and require large, high-quality datasets, creating specialised data samples containing examples of extremist communication is an essential step toward a practical solution. In this paper, we present a dataset compiled for this purpose and discuss the classification methods that can be used for extremism detection. The manually annotated Arabic Twitter dataset consists of 89,816 tweets published between 2011 and 2021. Using guidelines, three expert annotators labelled the tweets as extremist or non-extremist. Exploratory data analysis was performed to understand the dataset’s features. Classification algorithms were used with the dataset, including logistic regression, support vector machine, multinominal naïve Bayes, random forest, and BERT. Among the traditional machine learning models, support vector machine with term frequency-inverse document frequency features achieved the highest accuracy (0.9729). However, BERT outperformed the traditional models with an accuracy of 0.9749. This dataset is expected to enhance the accuracy of Arabic online extremism classification in future research, and so we have made it publicly available.

AB  - Although bibliometrics are normally applied to journal articles when used to support research evaluations, conference papers are at least as important in fast-moving computing-related fields. It is therefore important to assess the relative advantages of citations and altmetrics for computing conference papers to make an informed decision about which, if any, to use. This paper compares Scopus citations with Mendeley reader counts for conference papers and journal articles that were published between 1996 and 2018 in 11 computing fields and that had at least one US author. The data showed high correlations between Scopus citation counts and Mendeley reader counts in all fields and most years, but with few Mendeley readers for older conference papers and few Scopus citations for new conference papers and journal articles. The results therefore suggest that Mendeley reader counts have a substantial advantage over citation counts for recently published conference papers due to their greater speed, but are unsuitable for older conference papers.

AB  - We propose an operationalization of the rural and urban analogy introduced in Becher and Trowler (2001). According to them, a specialism is rural if it is organized into many, smaller topics of research, with higher author mobility among them, lower rate of collaboration and productivity, lower competition for resources and citation recognitions compared to an urban specialism. It is assumed that most humanities specialisms are rural while science specialisms are in general urban: we set to test this hypothesis empirically. We first propose an operationalization of the theory in most of its quantifiable aspects. We then consider specialisms from history, literature, computer science, biology, astronomy. Our results show that specialisms in the humanities present a sensibly lower citation and textual connectivity, in agreement with their organization into more, smaller topics per specialism, as suggested by the analogy. We argue that the intellectual organization of rural specialisms might indeed be qualitative different from urban ones, discouraging the straightforward application of citation-based indicators commonly applied to urban specialisms without a dedicated re-design in acknowledgement of these differences.

AB  - Due to the rapidly increasing number of scientific articles, finding valuable work for further research has become tedious and time consuming. To alleviate this issue, search engines have used citation-based article impact ranking. However, most engines rely on very simplistic impact measures (usually the citation count) and make the problematic assumption that there is a one-size-fits-all impact measure. To address these problems, we present BIP! Finder, a search engine that facilitates the identification of valuable articles by exploiting two different impact measures, each capturing a different aspect of the article impact. In addition, BIP! Finder provides many useful features (article comparison, intuitive visualisations, article bookmarking mechanism, etc.) making it a powerful addition to the researcher's toolbox.

AB  - A citation is deemed as a potential parameter to determine linkage between research articles. The parameter has extensively been employed to form multifarious academic aspects like calculating the impact factor of journals, h-Index of researchers, allocate different research grants, find the latest research trends, etc. The current state-of-the-art contends that all citations are not of equal importance. Based on this argument, the current trend in citation classification community categorizes citations into important and non-important reasons. The community has proposed different approaches to extract important citations such as citation count, context-based, metadata, and textual based approaches. The contemporary state-of-the-art in citation classification community ignores significantly potential features that can play a vital role in citation classification. This research presents a novel approach for binary citation classification by exploiting section-wise in-text citation frequencies, similarity score, and overall citation count-based features. The study also introduces machine learning algorithms based novel approach for assigning appropriate weights to the logical sections of research papers. The weights are allocated to the citations with respect to their sections. To perform the classification, we used three classification techniques, Support Vector Machine, Kernel Linear Regression, and Random Forest. The experiment was performed on two annotated benchmark datasets that contain 465 and 311 citation pairs of research articles respectively. The results revealed that the proposed approach attained an improved value of precision (i.e., 0.84 vs 0.72) from contemporary state-of-the-art approach.

AB  - This contribution argues that Reddit, as a massive, categorized, open-access dataset, is a useful data source, for "almost any topic". Hence, it can be used in data science, e.g. for knowledge exploration. This statement is backed-up with presented analysis, based on 180 manually annotated papers, related to Reddit itself, and data acquired from popular databases of scientific papers. Finally, an open source tool is introduced, which provides an easy access to Reddit resources, and an exploratory data analysis of how Reddit covers selected topics. These functions can be used as a prelude analysis to a broader exploration of Reddit's applicability.

AB  - The goal of this paper is to conduct the study on the text classification for financial news based on partial information. By a fact that an indispensable step for the efficient use of topic information embedded in financial news is the text classification, a new neural network called "All Dataset based on CharCNN (Character Convolutional Neural Networks) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)" (in short, AD-CharCGNN) which extracts a part of the financial article and incorporates both time domain and spatial domain to classify financial texts is proposed. In the study of this paper, we first build a character level vocabulary by reading all characters of the financial dataset, part of each financial text which will be classified is mapped to a high-dimensional spatial vector based on the vocabulary. Then, the vectors are convoluted in the spatial domain to get the text local features, and next, the features are processed by the gated recurrent units to get the features contained time information. Finally, the features which contain spatial and time information will be classified through softmax function to get the text classification results. Our results on the experiments confirm that the network proposed in this paper works effectively with the accuracy of 96.45%, and it seems that the text classification algorithm with the feature by taking only partial text part is more suitable for the application of the practice. Meanwhile, for the input with character level vector, the network is not only suitable for Chinese but also for other languages.

AB  - In 1751, Jean le Rond d'Alembert had a dream: "to make a genealogical or encyclopedic tree which will gather the various branches of knowledge together under a single point of view and will serve to indicate their origin and their relationships to one another". In this paper, we address the question identifying the branches of science by taking advantage of the massive digitization of scientific production. In the framework of complex systems studies, we first formalize the notion of level and scale of knowledge dynamics. Then, we demonstrate how we can reconstruct a reasonably precise and concise multi-scale and multi-level approximation of the dynamical structures of Science: phylomemies. We introduce the notion of phylomemetic networks—projections of phylomemies in low dimensional spaces that can be grasped by the human mind—and propose a new algorithm to reconstruct both phylomemies and the associated phylomemetic networks. This algorithm offers, passing, a new temporal clustering on evolving semantic networks. Last, we show how phylomemy reconstruction can take into account users' preferences within the framework of embodied cognition, thus defining a third way between the quest for objective "ground truth" and the ad-hoc adaptation to a particular user's preferences. The robustness of this approach is illustrated by several case studies.

AB  - This paper defines and explores the direct citations between citing publications (DCCPs) of a publication. We construct an ego-centered citation network for each paper that contains all of its citing papers and itself, as well as the citation relationships among them. By utilizing a large-scale scholarly dataset from the computer science field in the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG-CS) dataset, we find that DCCPs exist universally in medium and highly cited papers. For those papers that have DCCPs, DCCPs do occur frequently; highly cited papers tend to contain more DCCPs than others. Meanwhile, the number of DCCPs of papers published in different years does not vary dramatically. The current paper also discusses the relationship between DCCPs and some indirect citation relationships (e.g., co-citation and bibliographic coupling).

AB  - The use of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) as platforms for data capture has rapidly increased in recent years. However, while there has been significant investment in improving the aircraft, sensors, operations, and legislation infrastructure for such, little attention has been paid to supporting the management of the complex data capture pipeline sUAS involve. This paper reports on a four-year, community-based investigation into the tools, data practices, and challenges that currently exist for particularly researchers using sUAS as data capture platforms. The key results of this effort are: (1) sUAS captured data—as a set that is rapidly growing to include data in a wide range of Physical and Environmental Sciences, Engineering Disciplines, and many civil and commercial use cases—is characterized as both sharing many traits with traditional remote sensing data and also as exhibiting—as common across the spectrum of disciplines and use cases—novel characteristics that require novel data support infrastructure; and (2), given this characterization of sUAS data and its potential value in the identified wide variety of use case, we outline eight challenges that need to be addressed in order for the full value of sUAS captured data to be realized. We conclude that there would be significant value gained and costs saved across both commercial and academic sectors if the global sUAS user and data management communities were to address these challenges in the immediate to near future, so as to extract the maximal value of sUAS captured data for the lowest long-term effort and monetary cost.

AB  - Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification is a challenging classification task where the classes are hierarchically structured, with superclass and subclass relationships. It is a very common task, for instance, in Protein Function Prediction, where a protein can simultaneously perform multiple functions. In these tasks it is very difficult to achieve a high predictive performance, since hundreds or even thousands of classes with imbalanced data distributions have to be considered. In addition, the models should ideally be easily interpretable to allow the validation of the knowledge extracted from the data. This work proposes and investigates the use of Genetic Algorithms to induce rules that are both hierarchical and multi-label. Several experiments with different fitness functions and genetic operators are preformed to obtain different Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification rules. The different proposed configurations of Genetic Algorithms are evaluated together with state-of-the-art methods for HMC rule induction based on Ant Colony Optimization and Predictive Clustering Trees, using many datasets related to the Protein Function Prediction task. The experimental results show that it is possible to recommend the best configuration in terms of predictive performance and model interpretability.

AB  - In text classification, texts have to be transformed into numeric representations suitable for the learning algorithms. A main problem with the commonly used bag of words method is the high dimensions of vector space, as well as the need for language-dependent tools. In the present study, text classification is performed based on a novel bi-gram alphabet approach to construct feature terms. The proposed approach has two main contributions to text classification area. First, we have demonstrated the possibility of using constant feature terms that are based on the standard alphabet without the need for the documents vocabularies; this definitely helps in reducing the dimensions of the vector space for large corpus. Second, it does not require natural language processing tools. The current work has proved the ability to classify collections of Arabic or English text documents successfully. It showed approximately 80% savings in vector space and 2% performance improvement compared to the best recorded results on Arabic dataset Aljazeera News.

AB  - Realistic, relevant, and reproducible experiments often need input traces collected from real-world environments. In this work, we focus on traces of workflows-common in datacenters, clouds, and HPC infrastructures. We show that the state-of-the-art in using workflow-traces raises important issues: (1) the use of realistic traces is infrequent and (2) the use of realistic, open-access traces even more so. Alleviating these issues, we introduce the Workflow Trace Archive (WTA), an open-access archive of workflow traces from diverse computing infrastructures and tooling to parse, validate, and analyze traces. The WTA includes > 48 million workflows captured from > 10 computing infrastructures, representing a broad diversity of trace domains and characteristics. To emphasize the importance of trace diversity, we characterize the WTA contents and analyze in simulation the impact of trace diversity on experiment results. Our results indicate significant differences in characteristics, properties, and workflow structures between workload sources, domains, and fields.

AB  - Abstract This study provides the first systematic, international, large‐scale evidence on the extent and nature of multiple institutional affiliations on journal publications. Studying more than 15 million authors and 22 million articles from 40 countries we document that: In 2019, almost one in three articles was (co‐)authored by authors with multiple affiliations and the share of authors with multiple affiliations increased from around 10% to 16% since 1996. The growth of multiple affiliations is prevalent in all fields and it is stronger in high impact journals. About 60% of multiple affiliations are between institutions from within the academic sector. International co‐affiliations, which account for about a quarter of multiple affiliations, most often involve institutions from the United States, China, Germany and the United Kingdom, suggesting a core‐periphery network. Network analysis also reveals a number communities of countries that are more likely to share affiliations. We discuss potential causes and show that the timing of the rise in multiple affiliations can be linked to the introduction of more competitive funding structures such as “excellence initiatives” in a number of countries. We discuss implications for science and science policy.

AB  - Exploiting label hierarchies has become a promising approach to tackling the zero-shot multi-label text classification (ZS-MTC) problem. Conventional methods aim to learn a matching model between text and labels, using a graph encoder to incorporate label hierarchies to obtain effective label representations (Rios and Kavuluru, 2018). More recently, pretrained models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) have been used to convert classification tasks into a textual entailment task (Yin et al., 2019). This approach is naturally suitable for the ZS-MTC task. However, pretrained models are underexplored in the existing work because they do not generate individual vector representations for text or labels, making it unintuitive to combine them with conventional graph encoding methods. In this paper, we explore to improve pretrained models with label hierarchies on the ZS-MTC task. We propose a Reinforced Label Hierarchy Reasoning (RLHR) approach to encourage interdependence among labels in the hierarchies during training. Meanwhile, to overcome the weakness of flat predictions, we design a rollback algorithm that can remove logical errors from predictions during inference. Experimental results on three real-life datasets show that our approach achieves better performance and outperforms previous non-pretrained methods on the ZS-MTC task.

AB  - Text clustering is one of the efficient unsupervised learning techniques used to partition a huge number of text documents into a subset of clusters. In which, each cluster contains similar documents and the clusters contain dissimilar text documents. Nature-inspired optimization algorithms have been successfully used to solve various optimization problems, including text document clustering problems. In this paper, a comprehensive review is presented to show the most related nature-inspired algorithms that have been used in solving the text clustering problem. Moreover, comprehensive experiments are conducted and analyzed to show the performance of the common well-know nature-inspired optimization algorithms in solving the text document clustering problems including Harmony Search (HS) Algorithm, Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Krill Herd Algorithm (KHA), Cuckoo Search (CS) Algorithm, Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Bat-inspired Algorithm (BA). Seven text benchmark datasets are used to validate the performance of the tested algorithms. The results showed that the performance of the well-known nurture-inspired optimization algorithms almost the same with slight differences. For improvement purposes, new modified versions of the tested algorithms can be proposed and tested to tackle the text clustering problems.

The ties considered include coauthorship, past colocation, and relationships mediated by advisers and the alma mater. With fixed effects capturing subject similarity and article quality, we find linkages are strongly associated with citation. Controlling for ties generally halves the negative impact of geographic barriers on citations. Ties matter more for less prominent and more recent papers and have retained their quantitative importance in recent years. The impact of distance, controlling for ties, has fallen and is statistically insignificant after 2004.

AB  - Nanopublications are Resource Description Framework (RDF) graphs encoding scientific facts extracted from the literature and enriched with provenance and attribution information. There are millions of nanopublications currently available on the Web, especially in the life science domain. Nanopublications are thought to facilitate the discovery, exploration, and re-use of scientific facts. Nevertheless, they are still not widely used by scientists outside specific circles; they are hard to find and rarely cited. We believe this is due to the lack of services to seek, find and understand nanopublications’ content. To this end, we present the NanoWeb application to seamlessly search, access, explore, and re-use the nanopublications publicly available on the Web. For the time being, NanoWeb focuses on the life science domain where the vastest amount of nanopublications are available. It is a unified access point to the world of nanopublications enabling search over graph data, direct connections to evidence papers, and scientific curated databases, and visual and intuitive exploration of the relation network created by the encoded scientific facts.

AB  - Abstract Uncovering the driving forces, strategic landscapes, and evolutionary mechanisms of China’s research systems is attracting rising interest around the globe. One topic of interest is to understand the problem-solving patterns in China’s research systems now and in the future. Targeting a set of high-quality research articles published by Chinese researchers between 2009 and 2018, and indexed in the Essential Science Indicators database, we developed an intelligent bibliometrics-based methodology for identifying the problem-solving patterns from scientific documents. Specifically, science overlay maps incorporating link prediction were used to profile China’s disciplinary interactions and predict potential cross-disciplinary innovation at a macro level. We proposed a function incorporating word embedding techniques to represent subjects, actions, and objects (SAO) retrieved from combined titles and abstracts into vectors and constructed a tri-layer SAO network to visualize SAOs and their semantic relationships. Then, at a micro level, we developed network analytics for identifying problems and solutions from the SAO network, and recommending potential solutions for existing problems. Empirical insights derived from this study provide clues to understand China’s research strengths and the science policies underlying them, along with the key research problems and solutions that Chinese researchers are focusing on now and might pursue in the future.

After a survey of current academic and non-academic programs across the globe, we focus on Canadian programs and specifically on the education program of the SciNet HPC Consortium, using its detailed enrollment and course statistics for the past four to five years. Not only do these data display a steady and rapid increase in the demand for research-computing instruction, they also show a clear shift from traditional (high performance) computing to data-oriented methods. It is argued that this growing demand warrants specialized research computing degrees. The possible curricula of such degrees are described next, taking existing programs as an example, and adding SciNet's experiences of student desires as well as trends in advanced research computing.

AB  - As a significant field of study, thirty-five years of strategic management research has accumulated a substantial amount of knowledge. This bibliometric study explores whether the unlimited flow of knowledge and the globalization of education &amp; research in this time period, could drive away (or deter) the identification and specific interest of research in phenomena of national importance. Using bibliometric techniques and visualization of similarities (VOS) procedures of citation and co-citation analyses, this Paper explores research trends at the country level over 35 years using data from the Web of Science database. The aims are to identify: 1) the most visible and prominent actors at the country, regional, and global-level; 2) the evolution of the subjects of research into strategic management at the country, global, and supra-regional level; and 3) the evolution of journals publishing strategic management research articles by location. Findings suggest that common research subjects coexist at higher levels of aggregation, establishing the “paradigm” or general agreement about the field’s boundaries. Additionally, findings show that at the country level, rather than following a global trend, there is an enduring diversification of research agendas that bow to national and supranational factors from geographically close places.

AB  - Background Despite having a crucial role in scholarly publishing, peer reviewers do not typically require any training. The purpose of this study was to conduct an international survey on the current perceptions and motivations of researchers regarding peer review training. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted of biomedical researchers. A total of 2000 corresponding authors from 100 randomly selected medical journals were invited via email. Quantitative items were reported using frequencies and percentages or means and SE, as appropriate. A thematic content analysis was conducted for qualitative items in which two researchers independently assigned codes to the responses for each written-text question, and subsequently grouped the codes into themes. A descriptive definition of each category was then created and unique themes–as well as the number and frequency of codes within each theme–were reported. Results A total of 186 participants completed the survey of which 14 were excluded. The majority of participants indicated they were men (n = 97 of 170, 57.1%), independent researchers (n = 108 of 172, 62.8%), and primarily affiliated with an academic organization (n = 103 of 170, 62.8%). A total of 144 of 171 participants (84.2%) indicated they had never received formal training in peer review. Most participants (n = 128, 75.7%) agreed–of which 41 (32.0%) agreed strongly–that peer reviewers should receive formal training in peer review prior to acting as a peer reviewer. The most preferred training formats were online courses, online lectures, and online modules. Most respondents (n = 111 of 147, 75.5%) stated that difficulty finding and/or accessing training was a barrier to completing training in peer review. Conclusion Despite being desired, most biomedical researchers have not received formal training in peer review and indicated that training was difficult to access or not available.

AB  - Search result diversification of text documents is especially necessary when a user issues a faceted or ambiguous query to the search engine. A variety of approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue in recent years. In this article, we propose a group of fusion-based result diversification methods with the aim to improve performance that considers both relevance and diversity. They are linear combinations of scores that are obtained from different component search systems. The weight of each search system is determined by considering three factors: performance, dissimilarity, and complementarity. There are two major contributions. Firstly, we find that all the three factors of performance and complementarity and dissimilarity are useful for effective weighting of linear combination. Secondly, we present the logarithmic function-based model for converting ranking information into scores. Experiments are carried out with four groups of results submitted to the TREC web diversity task. Experimental results show that some of the fusion methods that use the aforementioned techniques perform more effectively than the state-of-the-art fusion methods for result diversification.

AB  - ABSTRACT Reputation is often overlooked in the geography of innovation studies, but may represent a relevant outcome of the participation in multi‐scalar research and innovation networks. To date, a limited number of studies have outlined how collaborations in inter‐organizational networks contribute to build academic reputation and scientific excellence, generally without distinguishing between the two concepts. This paper aims at assessing to what extent the degree of participation in the European Union nanotechnology network contributes to determine the reputation of universities as captured by renowned university rankings. Reputation is conceptualized as either the opinion of other academics about a given university (“academic reputation”) or scientific achievements (“scientific excellence”). The findings presented in this paper suggest that cooperation in international inter‐organizational networks is not only essential for securing research funds and acquiring new relevant knowledge but also for positively contributing to shape academic reputation and enhance scientific excellence.

AB  - In this study, the scientific performance of Italian and Norwegian university professors is analysed using bibliometric indicators. The study is based on over 36,000 individuals and their publication output during the period 2011-2015. Applying a multidimensional indicator in which several aspects of the research performance are captured, we find large differences in the performance of men and women. These gender differences are evident across all analysed levels, such as country, field, and academic position. However, most of the gender differences can be explained by the tails of the distributions-in particular, there is a much higher proportion of men among the top 10% performing scientists. For the remaining 90% of the population, the gender differences are practically non-existent. The results of the two countries, which differ in terms of the societal role of women, are contrasting. Further, we discuss possible biases that are intrinsic in quantitative performance indicators, which might disfavour female researchers.

AB  - This paper introduces a novel scientometrics method and applies it to estimate the subject coverages of many of the popular English-focused bibliographic databases in academia. The method uses query results as a common denominator to compare a wide variety of search engines, repositories, digital libraries, and other bibliographic databases. The method extends existing sampling-based approaches that analyze smaller sets of database coverages. The findings show the relative and absolute subject coverages of 56 databases-information that has often not been available before. Knowing the databases' absolute subject coverage allows the selection of the most comprehensive databases for searches requiring high recall/sensitivity, particularly relevant in lookup or exploratory searches. Knowing the databases' relative subject coverage allows the selection of specialized databases for searches requiring high precision/specificity, particularly relevant in systematic searches. The findings illustrate not only differences in the disciplinary coverage of Google Scholar, Scopus, or Web of Science, but also of less frequently analyzed databases. For example, researchers might be surprised how Meta (discontinued), Embase, or Europe PMC are found to cover more records than PubMed in Medicine and other health subjects. These findings should encourage researchers to re-evaluate their go-to databases, also against newly introduced options. Searching with more comprehensive databases can improve finding, particularly when selecting the most fitting databases needs particular thought, such as in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. This comparison can also help librarians and other information experts re-evaluate expensive database procurement strategies. Researchers without institutional access learn which open databases are likely most comprehensive in their disciplines.

AB  - Research for development organizations generate tremendous amount of accessible knowledge, but given their scale, time and resource constraints, the impact of outputs is not systematically analyzed. This is because traditional bibliometric analyses present limitations to synthesize accumulated knowledge and retrofitting indicators to historical outputs. To address these shortcomings, this study proposes an integrated, web-based approach to systematically analyze the production and diffusion of knowledge from large-scale research programs, using climate research of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) as a case study. Our analytical framework employs text mining, social network analysis and hyperlink analysis to an unstructured mass of publicly available digital artifacts such as institutional repositories, citation databases, and social media to uncover narratives, dynamics, and relationships. Findings show CIMMYT's climate research is strongly incorporated into a holistic systems approach and that the institution is actively engaged in knowledge exchanges with key actors from the scientific, development and public policy communities. The proposed analytical framework establishes an effective approach for research for development organizations to leverage existing online data sources to assess the extent of their knowledge production, dissemination, and reach.

AB  - Science maps are visual representations of the structure and dynamics of scholarly knowl­edge. They aim to show how fields, disciplines, journals, scientists, publications, and scientific terms relate to each other. Science mapping is the body of methods and techniques that have been developed for generating science maps. This entry is an introduction to science maps and science mapping. It focuses on the conceptual, theoretical, and methodological issues of science mapping, rather than on the mathematical formulation of science mapping techniques. After a brief history of science mapping, we describe the general procedure for building a science map, presenting the data sources and the methods to select, clean, and pre-process the data. Next, we examine in detail how the most common types of science maps, namely the citation-based and the term-based, are generated. Both are based on networks: the former on the network of publications connected by citations, the latter on the network of terms co-occurring in publications. We review the rationale behind these mapping approaches, as well as the techniques and methods to build the maps (from the extraction of the network to the visualization and enrichment of the map). We also present less-common types of science maps, including co-authorship networks, interlocking editorship networks, maps based on patents’ data, and geographic maps of science. Moreover, we consider how time can be represented in science maps to investigate the dynamics of science. We also discuss some epistemological and sociological topics that can help in the interpretation, contextualization, and assessment of science maps. Then, we present some possible applications of science maps in science policy. In the conclusion, we point out why science mapping may be interesting for all the branches of meta-science, from knowl­edge organization to epistemology.

AB  - Abstract. The American Geophysical Union (AGU) is an Earth and space science professional society based in the United States. Research conducted by AGU members ranges from the Earth's deep interior to the outer planets of our solar system. However, little research exists on the AGU meeting itself. In this work, we apply network analysis and scientometrics to 17 years of AGU Fall Meetings. We are interested in the AGU network structure and what its properties can tell us about how the procedures of the AGU Fall Meeting can be enhanced to facilitate better scientific communication and collaboration. We quantify several network properties and illustrate how this type of analysis can enhance meeting planning and layout. We conclude with practical strategies for the AGU Program Committee.

AB  - Abstract Computational models are often employed in systems biology to study the dynamic behaviours of complex systems. With the rise in the number of computational models, finding ways to improve the reusability of these models and their ability to reproduce virtual experiments becomes critical. Correct and effective model annotation in community-supported and standardised formats is necessary for this improvement. Here, we present recent efforts toward a common framework for annotated, accessible, reproducible and interoperable computational models in biology, and discuss key challenges of the field.

AB  - Abstract Collaboration is encouraged because it is believed to improve academic research, supported by indirect evidence in the form of more coauthored articles being more cited. Nevertheless, this might not reflect quality but increased self‐citations or the “audience effect”: citations from increased awareness through multiple author networks. We address this with the first science wide investigation into whether author numbers associate with journal article quality, using expert peer quality judgments for 122,331 articles from the 2014–20 UK national assessment. Spearman correlations between author numbers and quality scores show moderately strong positive associations (0.2–0.4) in the health, life, and physical sciences, but weak or no positive associations in engineering and social sciences, with weak negative/positive or no associations in various arts and humanities, and a possible negative association for decision sciences. This gives the first systematic evidence that greater numbers of authors associates with higher quality journal articles in the majority of academia outside the arts and humanities, at least for the UK. Positive associations between team size and citation counts in areas with little association between team size and quality also show that audience effects or other nonquality factors account for the higher citation rates of coauthored articles in some fields.

AB  - Major societal and environmental challenges involve complex systems that have diverse multi-scale interacting processes. Consider, for example, how droughts and water reserves affect crop production and how agriculture and industrial needs affect water quality and availability. Preventive measures, such as delaying planting dates and adopting new agricultural practices in response to changing weather patterns, can reduce the damage caused by natural processes. Understanding how these natural and human processes affect one another allows forecasting the effects of undesirable situations and study interventions to take preventive measures. For many of these processes, there are expert models that incorporate state-of-the-art theories and knowledge to quantify a system's response to a diversity of conditions. A major challenge for efficient modeling is the diversity of modeling approaches across disciplines and the wide variety of data sources available only in formats that require complex conversions. Using expert models for particular problems requires integration of models with third-party data as well as integration of models across disciplines. Modelers face significant heterogeneity that requires resolving semantic, spatiotemporal, and execution mismatches, which are largely done by hand today and may take more than 2 years of effort. We are developing a modeling framework that uses artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to reduce modeling effort while ensuring utility for decision making. Our work to date makes several innovative contributions: (1) an intelligent user interface that guides analysts to frame their modeling problem and assists them by suggesting relevant choices and automating steps along the way; (2) semantic metadata for models, including their modeling variables and constraints, that ensures model relevance and proper use for a given decision-making problem; and (3) semantic representations of datasets in terms of modeling variables that enable automated data selection and data transformations. This framework is implemented in the MINT (Model INTegration) framework, and currently includes data and models to analyze the interactions between natural and human systems involving climate, water availability, agricultural production, and markets. Our work to date demonstrates the utility of AI techniques to accelerate modeling to support decision-making and uncovers several challenging directions for future work.

AB  - Abstract This work shows the use of WEKA , a tool that implements the most common machine learning algorithms, to perform a Text Mining analysis on a set of documents. Applying these methods requires initial steps where the text is converted into a structured format. Both the processing phase and the analysis of the transformed dataset, using classification and clustering algorithms, can be carried out entirely with this tool, in a rigorous and simple way. The work describes the construction of two classification models starting from two different sets of documents. These models are not meant to be good or realistic, but just illustrate how WEKA can be used for a Text Mining analysis.

AB  - Abstract We present an algorithm and a software architecture for a cloud-based system that executes cyclic scientific workflows whose structure may change during run time. Existing approaches either rely on workflow definitions based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) or require workarounds to implement cyclic structures. In contrast, our system supports cycles natively, avoids workarounds, and as such reduces the complexity of workflow modelling and maintenance. Our algorithm traverses workflow graphs and transforms them iteratively into linear sequences of executable actions. We call these sequences process chains. Our software architecture distributes the process chains to multiple compute nodes in the cloud and oversees their execution. We evaluate our approach by applying it to two practical use cases from the domains of astronomy and engineering. We also compare it with two existing workflow management systems. The evaluation demonstrates that our algorithm is able to execute dynamically changing workflows with cycles and that design and maintenance of complex workflows is easier than with existing solutions. It also shows that our software architecture can run process chains on multiple compute nodes in parallel to significantly speed up the workflow execution. An implementation of our algorithm and the software architecture is available with the Steep Workflow Management System that we released under an open-source license. The resources for the first practical use case are also available as open source for reproduction.

AB  - Abstract Citation analysis has been applied to map the landscape of scientific disciplines and to assess the impact of publications. However, it is limited in that it assumes all citations to be of equal weight. Doing away with this assumption could make such studies even more insightful. Current developments in this regard focus on the evaluation of the syntactic and semantic qualities of the text that surrounds citations. Still lacking, however, are computational techniques to unpack the thematic context in which citations appear. It is against this backdrop that we propose a text clustering approach to derive contextual aspects of individual citations and the relationship between cited and citing work in an automated and scalable fashion. The method reveals a focal publication’s absorption and use within the scientific community. It can also facilitate impact assessments at all levels. In addition to analyzing individual publications, the method can also be extended to creating impact profiles for authors, institutions, disciplines, and regions. We illustrate our results based on a large corpus of full-text articles from the field of Information systems (IS) with the help of exemplary visualizations. In addition, we provide a case study, the scientific impact of the Technology acceptance model. This way, we not only show the usefulness of our method in comparison to existing techniques but also enhance the understanding of the field by providing an in-depth analysis of the absorption of a key IS theoretical base.

AB  - Computer science has experienced dramatic growth and diversification over the last twenty years. Towards a current understanding of the structure of this discipline, we analyze a large sample of the computer science literature from the DBLP database. For insight on the features of this cohort and the relationship within its components, we have constructed article level clusters based on either direct citations or co-citations, and reconciled them with major and minor subject categories in the All Science Journal Classification. We describe complementary insights from clustering by direct citation and co-citation, and both point to the increase in computer science publications and their scope. Our analysis reveals cross-category clusters, some that interact with external fields, such as the biological sciences, while others remain inward looking. Overall, we document an increase in computer science publications and their scope.

AB  - Since the appearance of digital research infrastructures in the humanities in the last decade, important efforts are being made to understand and model scholarly processes. Different methods are used in those investigations, which often result in abstract representations of research phases, taxonomies of scholarly activities, in conceptual frameworks, or in scholarly ontologies. While the aim of these representations is to inform the design of the digital infrastructures, the complexity and diversity of scholarly work pose the question about the applicability of those models for design and evaluation of research infrastructures and tools. In this paper, we explore a methodology to analyze workflows from a micro-perspective, which aims at capturing the transitions between activities. We use two scholarly projects as case studies, describe their research activities in detail by using existing ontologies and describe the connections between activities, and analyse generic transitions. We discuss what kinds of implications this approach has to evaluation and design of information systems and services to facilitate scholars' complex and varied research processes.

AB  - Researchers and scientists need rapid access to text documents such as research papers, source code and dissertations. Many research documents are available on the Internet and need more time to retrieve exact documents based on keywords. An efficient classification algorithm for retrieving documents based on keyword words is required. The traditional algorithm performs less because it never considers words' polysemy and the relationship between bag-of-words in keywords. To solve the above problem, Semantic Featured Convolution Neural Networks (SF-CNN) is proposed to obtain the key relationships among the searching keywords and build a structure for matching the words for retrieving correct text documents. The proposed SF-CNN is based on deep semantic-based bag-of-word representation for document retrieval. Traditional deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network never use semantic representation for bag-of-words. The experiment is performed with different document datasets for evaluating the performance of the proposed SF-CNN method. SF-CNN classifies the documents with an accuracy of 94% than the traditional algorithms.

AB  - Based on the entire population of Nobel laureates in science from 1901 to 2017, we show that North America’s rise as global power in science started in the 1920s. Following a transition period (1940s to 1960s), its scientific hegemony was consolidated in the 1970s. Yet since the 2000s, North America’s global leadership in science has come under pressure. In that time, its share of laureates across disciplines dropped, although it has retained its attractiveness as a destination for future laureates from Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. In addition, we find that North America has become apparently less effective since 2010 in transferring capacities for conducting ground-breaking research from one generation of scientists to another. Furthermore, both Europe and the Asia-Pacific region have similarly high shares of newcomer organizations with regard to where prize-winning work is conducted, indicating that these two regions are very active in the inter-organizational competition for scientific talent. Despite this competition, however, we find no support for the rise of a new global center of science.

AB  - From the beginning, the process of research and its publication is an ever-growing phenomenon and with the emergence of web technologies, its growth rate is overwhelming. On a rough estimate, more than thirty thousand research journals have been issuing around four million papers annually on average. Search engines, indexing services, and digital libraries have been searching for such publications over the web. Nevertheless, getting the most relevant articles against the user requests is yet a fantasy. It is mainly because the articles are not appropriately indexed based on the hierarchies of granular subject classification. To overcome this issue, researchers are striving to investigate new techniques for the classification of the research articles especially, when the complete article text is not available (a case of non-open access articles). The proposed study aims to investigate the multilabel classification over the available metadata in the best possible way and to assess, “to what extent metadata-based features can perform in contrast to content-based approaches.” In this regard, novel techniques for investigating multilabel classification have been proposed, developed, and evaluated on metadata such as the Title and Keywords of the articles. The proposed technique has been assessed for two diverse datasets, namely, from the Journal of universal computer science (J.UCS) and the benchmark dataset comprises of the articles published by the Association for computing machinery (ACM). The proposed technique yields encouraging results in contrast to the state-of-the-art techniques in the literature.

AB  - Data-intensive science communities are progressively adopting FAIR practices that enhance the visibility of scientific breakthroughs and enable reuse. At the core of this movement, research objects contain and describe scientific information and resources in a way compliant with the FAIR principles and sustain the development of key infrastructure and tools. This paper provides an account of the challenges, experiences and solutions involved in the adoption of FAIR around research objects over several Earth Science disciplines. During this journey, our work has been comprehensive, with outcomes including: an extended research object model adapted to the needs of earth scientists; the provisioning of digital object identifiers (DOI) to enable persistent identification and to give due credit to authors; the generation of content-based, semantically rich, research object metadata through natural language processing, enhancing visibility and reuse through recommendation systems and third-party search engines; and various types of checklists that provide a compact representation of research object quality as a key enabler of scientific reuse. All these results have been integrated in ROHub, a platform that provides research object management functionality to a wealth of applications and interfaces across different scientific communities. To monitor and quantify the community uptake of research objects, we have defined indicators and obtained measures via ROHub that are also discussed herein.

AB  - Limited attention has been afforded to mapping the ‘landscape’ of South African computing research. Prior studies have considered singular sub-disciplines, publications, or publication types. Given the growing prominence of computing disciplines, it is necessary to identify the patterns of research production, publication, collaboration, and impact of South African computing research. This study presents a scientometric investigation in this regard. Through the analysis of data accessed from the Scopus citation enhanced bibliographic database, the investigation presents findings in relation to annual research production, institutional differences in outputs, topics, collaboration, and citation impact. While characterised by institutional differences, over the period considered, South African computing research output has increased at a greater rate than that of South African research at large. Additionally, despite accounting for a greater proportion of all outputs, conference papers account for a smaller proportion of citations relative to journal articles or book chapters. Corresponding to previous investigations, there exists a tendency towards applied computing topics in contrast to more theoretical topics. Finally, the collaboration network was shown to be particularly de-centralised with many researchers clustered around institutions. The findings are of interest to all researchers conducting computing or related research in South Africa.

AB  - In this paper we introduce domain detection as a new natural language processing task. We argue that the ability to detect textual segments that are domain-heavy (i.e., sentences or phrases that are representative of and provide evidence for a given domain) could enhance the robustness and portability of various text classification applications. We propose an encoder-detector framework for domain detection and bootstrap classifiers with multiple instance learning. The model is hierarchically organized and suited to multilabel classification. We demonstrate that despite learning with minimal supervision, our model can be applied to text spans of different granularities, languages, and genres. We also showcase the potential of domain detection for text summarization.

AB  - Multi-label document classification, associating one document instance with a set of relevant labels, is attracting more and more research attention. Existing methods explore the incorporation of information beyond text, such as document metadata or label structure. These approaches however either simply utilize the semantic information of metadata or employ the predefined parent-child label hierarchy, ignoring the heterogeneous graphical structures of metadata and labels, which we believe are crucial for accurate multi-label document classification. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel neural network based approach for multi-label document classification, in which two heterogeneous graphs are constructed and learned using heterogeneous graph transformers. One is metadata heterogeneous graph, which models various types of metadata and their topological relations. The other is label heterogeneous graph, which is constructed based on both the labels' hierarchy and their statistical dependencies. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show the proposed approach outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines.

AB  - This work presents a use case of building a data visualization interface for open-access repositories. The case in the analysis is the Brazilian Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (BDTD). From the almost 670,000 records of BDTD, one applies statistical methods using the language R. One of the visualization packages of R is called Shiny, which makes it easy to build interactive web applications straight from R. Through the app, a user can visualize data in a fast and customizable way. It could help to keep track of metadata and usage statistics over the repositories and also can be applied to discovering scientific information, such as bibliographic data and lists of specialists in a certain research domain. These data visualization tools can stimulate others to create open repositories and join either national, regional or international repositories networks.

AB  - This study investigates 3883 articles published by researchers affiliated with Chiang Mai University in science and technology from January 2010 to December 2019 to test whether research team characteristics and collaboration patterns can determine a citation rate. Citations were retrieved from the Scopus database and compared with their (1) number of authors, (2) type of publication, (3) gender of authors, (4) SJR values, (5) country of international collaborators, (6) number of affiliated institutions, and (7) international diversity index. The findings were based on quantile regressions and indicated that the number of authors strongly influenced citations, which increases the likelihood of being cited. The citation advantage of being a foreign-first author only existed at the 0.25th quantile; however, the evidence of foreign-first author citation advantages or disadvantages for the moderate and very productive publications was not found. A significantly positive effect of SJR value on citations was found while being a female first author negatively impacted the citation rate. These findings can be used in the planning and managing process of producing scientific and technological research to improve the research quality, boost the research impact, and increase opportunities for research results to be utilized.

AB  - User feedback is essential for understanding user needs. In this paper, we use free-text obtained from a survey on sleep-related issues to build a deep neural networks-based text classifier. However, to train the deep neural networks model, a lot of labelled data is needed. To reduce manual data labelling, we propose a method which is a combination of data augmentation and pseudo-labelling: data augmentation is applied to labelled data to increase the size of the initial train set and then the trained model is used to annotate unlabelled data with pseudo-labels. The result shows that the model with the data augmentation achieves macro-averaged f1 score of 65.2% while using 4,300 training data, whereas the model without data augmentation achieves macro-averaged f1 score of 68.2% with around 14,000 training data. Furthermore, with the combination of pseudo-labelling, the model achieves macro-averaged f1 score of 62.7% with only using 1,400 training data with labels. In other words, with the proposed method we can reduce the amount of labelled data for training while achieving relatively good performance.

AB  - Performance evaluation and prediction of academic achievements is an essential task for scientists, research organizations, research funding bodies, and government agencies alike. Recently, heterogeneous networks have been used to evaluate or predict performance of multi-entities including papers, researchers, and venues with some success. However, only a minimum of effort has been made to predict the future influence of papers, researchers and venues. In this paper, we propose a new framework WMR-Rank for this purpose. Based on the dynamic and heterogeneous network of multiple entities, we extract seven types of relations among them. The framework supports useful features including the refined granularity of relevant entities such as authors and venues, time awareness for published papers and their citations, differentiating the contribution of multiple coauthors to the same paper, amongst others. By leveraging all seven types of relations and fusing the rich information in a mutually reinforcing style, we are able to predict future influence of papers, authors and venues more precisely. Using the ACL dataset, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach considerably outperforms state-of-the art competitors.

AB  - Predicting the output of research grants is of considerable relevance to research funding bodies, scientific entities and government agencies. In this study, we investigate whether text features extracted from projects title and abstracts are able to identify productive grants. Our analysis was conducted in three distinct areas, namely Medicine, Dentistry and Veterinary Medicine. Topical and complexity text features were used to identify predictors of productivity. The results indicate that there is a statistically significant relationship between text features and grants productivity, however such a dependence is weak. A feature relevance analysis revealed that the abstract text length and metrics derived from lexical diversity are among the most discriminative features. We also found that the prediction accuracy has a dependence on the considered project language and that topical features are more discriminative than text complexity measurements. Our findings suggest that text features should be used in combination with other features to assist the identification of relevant research ideas.

AB  - Traditional news topic classification methods suffer from inaccurate text semantics, sparse text features and low classification accuracy. Based on this, this paper proposes a news topic classification method based on Enhanced Language Representation with Informative Entities (ERNIE) and multi-feature fusion. A semantically more accurate representation of text embedding is obtained by ERNIE. In addition, this paper extracts word, context and key sentence based on the news text. The key sentences of the news are obtained through the TextRank algorithm, which enables the model to focus on the content points of the news. Finally, this paper uses the attention mechanism to realize the fusion of multiple features. The proposed method is experimented on BBCNews. The experimental results show that we achieve classification accuracies superior to those of the compared methods, while validating the structural validity of the proposed method. The method in this paper has a positive effect on promoting the research of news topic classification.

AB  - In course of the organization of Workshop III entitled "Cited References Analysis Using CRExplorer" at the International Conference of the International Society for Scientometrics and Informetrics (ISSI2021), we have prepared three reference publication year spectroscopy (RPYS) analyses: (i) papers published in Journal of Informetrics; (ii) papers regarding the topic altmetrics; and (iii) papers published by Ludo Waltman (we selected this researcher since he received the Derek de Solla Price Memorial Medal during the ISSI2021 conference). The first RPYS analysis has been presented live at the workshop and the second and third RPYS analyses have been left to the participants for undertaking after the workshop. Here, we present the results for all three RPYS analyses. The three analyses have shown quite different seminal papers with a few overlaps. Many of the foundational papers in the field of scientometrics (e.g., distributions of publications and citations, citation network and co-citation analyses, and citation analysis with the aim of impact measurement and research evaluation) were retrieved as seminal papers of the papers published in Journal of Informetrics. Mainly papers with discussions of the deficiencies of citation-based impact measurements and comparisons between altmetrics and citations were retrieved as seminal papers of the topic altmetrics. The RPYS analysis of the paper set published by Ludo Waltman mainly retrieved papers about network analyses, citation relations, and citation impact measurement.

AB  - Abstract The coronavirus pandemic has exposed a host of issues with the current scholarly communication system, one aspect being the discoverability of scientific knowledge. Observing the many shortcomings of discovery workflows in the course of COVID-19 confirms that discoverability itself is in crisis. In this article, we analyze the discoverability crisis and its root causes. We introduce open discovery infrastructure as a promising approach for the development of innovative discovery solutions. We present several efforts based on open discovery infrastructure that have emerged to provide better discovery of coronavirus research and discuss what is still needed to overcome the discoverability crisis.

AB  - Real-world multilabel data are high dimensional, and directly using them for label distribution learning (LDL) will incur extensive computational costs. We propose a multilabel distribution learning algorithm based on multioutput regression through manifold learning, referred to as MDLRML. By exploiting smooth, similar spaces' information provided by the samples' manifold learning and LDL, we link the two spaces' manifolds. This facilitates using the topological relationship of the manifolds in the feature space to guide the manifold construction of the label space. The smoothest regression function is used to fit the manifold data, and a locally constrained multioutput regression is designed to improve the data's local fitting. Based on the regression results, we enhance the logical labels into the label distributions, thereby mining and revealing the label's hidden information regarding importance or significance. Extensive experimental results using real-world multilabel datasets show that the proposed MDLRML algorithm significantly improves the multilabel distribution learning accuracy and efficiency over several existing state-of-the-art schemes.

AB  - We present a bibliometric analysis of a large corpus of research work by H. J. Eysenck (1916–1997), who was one of the most famous and productive psychologists of the 20th century. It utilizes new bibliometric tools to update an analysis of Rushton (2001), examining how articles cluster in terms of themes and co-authors. We present our analysis in the light of a recent investigation by King's College London, which concluded that a number of Eysenck's papers are ‘unsafe’ and they recommended that journal editors should consider their retraction. We enquire about the relationship between these personality and fatal disease papers and the wider body of Eysenck's work. Our analysis revealed that these papers are part of a research topic that stands apart from his many other seminal contributions to psychological knowledge; and, even if they were all retracted, this would have little impact on the main corpus of his work. Our analysis and presentation shines a new light on the contribution of Britain's most productive, but sometimes controversial, psychologist.

AB  - Innovations in dental sciences are potentially disruptive; however, the language barrier in the case of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) limits access to scientific studies. There is a necessity to measure the development of dental research across the LAC region, where economic power and postgraduate education access vary significantly. This article aims to analyze documents, citations, and journals and compare the SJR, H-Index, citation rates, and Co-occurrence Networks (Keywords) between dental journals published in LAC and the rest of the world, according to the report of Scimago Journal and Country Rank, between the years 1996 and 2020. Results show that Brazil leads dental research in the LAC, scoring the highest number of published documents, citations, and SJR metrics. The mean H-index and SJR of LAC dentistry journals are significantly lower than those of other regions (p &lt; 0.03); however, there are no significant differences in the mean total citations in the last 3 years between LAC and other regions (p &gt; 0.15). This suggests that the articles published in dentistry journals from LAC are being cited in similar proportions to the journals of other regions, but a large portion of these citations came from publications with low scientific impact.

AB  - This paper presents the development of an information and analytical system to foster scientific and technological development in a given scientific field. In this work, the main software tools for implementing distributed computing, which involves a set of software components for collecting, processing, and analyzing large amounts of data, are considered. In addition, various approaches for task coordination between different sets of software are discussed and techniques for storing large amounts of data are described. The system architecture and database schema are designed and tested. Nowadays, the intellectualization of individual software agents is a key aspect of a new generation of multiagent systems. For this reason, this paper develops an approach that can organize activities of a large number of software agents to increase system intellectualization through swarm intelligence at the level of individual agents. Three remote servers were used to build and test the system deployment, comprising such components as a platform for monitoring and scheduling workflow, data storage, and a graphical user interface that enables data retrieval and interaction on the Internet.

AB  - Summary Scientific publications from a group or consortium often form a coherent larger body of work with underlying threads and relationships. Rich social, structural, and topical networks between authors and organizations can be identified, and to convey these we have created the publicly available “Science Library” as a user‐centric, interactive portal. A key consideration in this endeavor is rapid and efficient curation of the corpus of publications, both in terms of assuring quality, as well minimizing the effort required. For this to be sustainable it must offer substantial benefits to the community and avoid excessive operational cost through cumbersome or complex processes. We describe the agility of the Science Library implementation as a controlled natural language (CNL) semantic knowledge graph and describe the different roles within the community to ensure efficient curation, validation, and provenance of the content. By describing the process of curation and validation, alongside the CNL‐based definition of the model we show how relatively non‐technical users are able to interact with, and contribute to the Science Library. This provides an extensible approach, initially based around digital library and virtual community capabilities, that can be applied more broadly to support other desired capabilities of Science Gateways.

AB  - Biological resources are multifarious encompassing organisms, genetic materials, populations or any other biotic components of ecosystems, and fine-grained data management and processing of these diverse types of resources proposes a tremendous challenge for both researchers and practitioners. Before the conceptualization of data lakes, former big data management platforms in the research fields of computational biology and biomedicine could not deal with many practical data management tasks very well. As an effective complement to those previous systems, data lakes were devised to store voluminous, varied and diversely structured or unstructured data in their native formats, for the sake of various analyses like reporting, modelling, data exploration, knowledge discovery, data visualization, advanced analysis, and machine learning. Due to their intrinsic traits, data lakes are thought to be ideal technologies for processing of hybrid biological resources in the format of text, image, audio, video, and structured tabular data. This paper proposes a method for constructing a practical data lake system for processing multi-modal biological data using a prototype system named ProtoDLS, especially from the explainability point of view, which is indispensable to the rigor, transparency, persuasiveness, and trustworthiness of the applications in the field. ProtoDLS adopts a horizontal pipeline to ensure the intra-component explainability factors from data acquisition to data presentation, and a vertical pipeline to ensure the inner-component explainability factors including mathematics, algorithm, execution time, memory consumption, network latency, security, sampling size, etc. The dual mechanism can ensure the explainability guarantees on the entirety of the data lake system. ProtoDLS proves that a single point of explainability cannot thoroughly expound the cause and effect of the matter from an overall perspective, and adopting a systematic, dynamic, and multi-sided way of thinking and a system-oriented analysis method is critical when designing a data processing system for biological resources.

AB  - For a long time the ability to solve abstract reasoning tasks was considered one of the hallmarks of human intelligence. Recent advances in application of deep learning (DL) methods led, as in many other domains, to surpassing human abstract reasoning performance, specifically in the most popular type of such problems - the Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPMs). While the efficacy of DL systems is indeed impressive, the way they approach the RPMs is very different from that of humans. State-of-the-art systems solving RPMs rely on massive pattern-based training and sometimes on exploiting biases in the dataset, whereas humans concentrate on identification of the rules / concepts underlying the RPM (or generally a visual reasoning task) to be solved. Motivated by this cognitive difference, this work aims at combining DL with human way of solving RPMs and getting the best of both worlds. Specifically, we cast the problem of solving RPMs into multi-label classification framework where each RPM is viewed as a multi-label data point, with labels determined by the set of abstract rules underlying the RPM. For efficient training of the system we introduce a generalisation of the Noise Contrastive Estimation algorithm to the case of multi-label samples. Furthermore, we propose a new sparse rule encoding scheme for RPMs which, besides the new training algorithm, is the key factor contributing to the state-of-the-art performance. The proposed approach is evaluated on two most popular benchmark datasets (Balanced-RAVEN and PGM) and on both of them demonstrates an advantage over the current state-of-the-art results. Contrary to applications of contrastive learning methods reported in other domains, the state-of-the-art performance reported in the paper is achieved with no need for large batch sizes or strong data augmentation.

AB  - Scientific workflows have become mainstream for conducting large-scale scientific research. As a result, many workflow applications and Workflow Management Systems (WMSs) have been developed as part of the cyberinfrastructure to allow scientists to execute their applications seamlessly on a range of distributed platforms. Although the scientific community has addressed this challenge from both theoretical and practical approaches, failure prediction, detection, and recovery still raise many research questions. In this paper, we propose an approach inspired by the control theory developed as part of autonomic computing to predict failures before they happen, and mitigated them when possible. The proposed approach is inspired on the proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller) control loop mechanism, which is widely used in industrial control systems, where the controller will react to adjust its output to mitigate faults. PID controllers aim to detect the possibility of a non-steady state far enough in advance so that an action can be performed to prevent it from happening. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, we tackle two common execution faults of large scale data-intensive workflows—data storage overload and memory overflow. We developed a simulator, which implements and evaluates simple standalone PID-inspired controllers to autonomously manage data and memory usage of a data-intensive bioinformatics workflow that consumes/produces over 4.4 TB of data, and requires over 24 TB of memory to run all tasks concurrently. Experimental results obtained via simulation indicate that workflow executions may significantly benefit from the controller-inspired approach, in particular under online and unknown conditions. Simulation results show that nearly-optimal executions (slowdown of 1.01) can be attained when using our proposed method, and faults are detected and mitigated far in advance of their occurrence.

AB  - The detection of emerging trends is of great interest to many stakeholders such as government and industry. Previous research focused on the machine learning, network analysis and time series analysis based on the bibliometrics data and made a promising progress. However, these approaches inevitably have time delay problems. For the reason that leader papers of "emerging topics" share the similar characters with the "cover papers", this study present a novel approach to translate the "emerging topics" detection to "cover paper" prediction. By using "AdaBoost model" and topic model, we construct a machine learning framework to imitate the top journal (chief) editor's judgement to select cover paper from material science. The results of our prediction were validated by consulting with field experts. This approach was also suitable for the Nature, Science, and Cell journals.

AB  - How are social and intellectual relations structured and given shape within research universities?To answer these questions, we test to what extent various theoretically predicted processes explain the dynamics of academics' networks of collaboration and shared language use in a unique longitudinal data set (1994 to 2005) of 2,631 faculty at a large private American university.Using the latest advances in stochastic actor-oriented models (in RSiena) and text analysis, we found that social and intellectual relations are clustered and centralized on bridging faculty who form a broader interdisciplinary hub of research in the university, and that, over time, this hub disseminated its style of (interdisciplinary) research to other faculty.These networks are shaped by selection based on age, gender, race, and academic rank as well as the coevolution of social and intellectual relations over time.Clear differences emerge in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields and are strongly driven by structural mechanisms of clustering and centralization, whereas non-STEM fields (social sciences and humanities) are strongly driven by personal preferences of faculty members.

AB  - Survey research is appropriate and necessary to address certain research question types. This paper aims to provide a general overview of the textual similarity in the literature. Measuring textual similarity tends to have an increasingly important turn in related topics like text classification, recovery of specific information from data, clustering, topic retrieval, subject tracking, question answering, essay grading, summarization, and the nowadays trending Conversational Agents (CA), which is a program deals with humans through natural language conversation. Finding the similarity between terms is the essential portion of textual similarity, then used as a major phase for sentence-level, paragraph-level, and script-level similarities. In particular, we concern with textual similarity in Arabic. In the Arabic Language, applying Natural language Processing (NLP) tasks are very challenging indeed as it has many characteristics, which are considered as confrontations. However, many approaches for measuring textual similarity have been presented for Arabic text reviewed and compared in this paper.

AB  - Advances in science and technology depend on the work of research teams and the publication of results through peer-reviewed articles representing a growing socio-economic resource. Current methods to mine the scientific literature regarding a field of interest focus on content, but the workforce credited by authorship remains largely unexplored. Notably, appropriate measures of scientific production are debated. Here, a new bibliometric approach named TeamTree analysis is introduced that visualizes the development and composition of the workforce driving a field. A new citation-independent measure that scales with the H index estimates impact based on publication record, genealogical ties and collaborative connections. This author-centered approach complements existing tools to mine the scientific literature and to evaluate research across disciplines.

AB  - It is widely accepted that data is fundamental for research and should therefore be cited as textual scientific publications. However, issues like data citation, handling and counting the credit generated by such citations, remain open research questions. Data credit is a new measure of value built on top of data citation, which enables us to annotate data with a value, representing its importance. Data credit can be considered as a new tool that, together with traditional citations, helps to recognize the value of data and its creators in a world that is ever more depending on data. In this paper we define data credit distribution (DCD) as a process by which credit generated by citations is given to the single elements of a database. We focus on a scenario where a paper cites data from a database obtained by issuing a query. The citation generates credit which is then divided among the database entities responsible for generating the query output. One key aspect of our work is to credit not only the explicitly cited entities, but even those that contribute to their existence, but which are not accounted in the query output. We propose a data credit distribution strategy (CDS) based on data provenance and implement a system that uses the information provided by data citations to distribute the credit in a relational database accordingly. As use case and for evaluation purposes, we adopt the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (GtoPdb), a curated relational database. We show how credit can be used to highlight areas of the database that are frequently used. Moreover, we also underline how credit rewards data and authors based on their research impact, and not merely on the number of citations. This can lead to designing new bibliometrics for data citations.

AB  - The present study used scientometrics and word co-occurrence analysis to identify the most important topics and to assess trends in English for medical purposes over time. Documents indexed in Scopus and Web of Science were used to examine various indicators such as keywords, countries, organizations, and authors. Search results were preprocessed through BibExcel to create a file for mapping, and word co-occurrence analysis was applied to evaluate the publications. Also, scientific maps, author's network, and country contributions were depicted using VOSviewer and NetDraw. The most productive authors and countries were determined. Regarding the trend analysis, highly frequent words were examined at six-year intervals. The findings indicated that 81 countries, 1,304 authors, and 799 organizations have contributed to the scientific mobility of this field. Keyword co-occurrence analysis indicated that topics have shifted from language-specific foci to interactive domains. These findings offer evidence-based information about the past and present trends in EMP research topics and trends, as well as its future directions, moving from linear patterns (solely related to linguistic components) towards a more interrelated pattern of issues clustering around a medical education and learning topics.

AB  - Abstract With an escalating arms race to adopt machine learning (ML) in diverse application domains, there is an urgent need to support declarative machine learning over distributed data platforms. Toward this goal, a new framework is needed where users can specify ML tasks in a manner where programming is decoupled from the underlying algorithmic and system concerns. In this paper, we argue that declarative abstractions based on Datalog are natural fits for machine learning and propose a purely declarative ML framework with a Datalog query interface. We show that using aggregates in recursive Datalog programs entails a concise expression of ML applications, while providing a strictly declarative formal semantics. This is achieved by introducing simple conditions under which the semantics of recursive programs is guaranteed to be equivalent to that of aggregate-stratified ones. We further provide specialized compilation and planning techniques for semi-naive fixpoint computation in the presence of aggregates and optimization strategies that are effective on diverse recursive programs and distributed data platforms. To test and demonstrate these research advances, we have developed a powerful and user-friendly system on top of Apache Spark. Extensive evaluations on large-scale datasets illustrate that this approach will achieve promising performance gains while improving both programming flexibility and ease of development and deployment for ML applications.

AB  - Systems based on Internet of Things (IoT) technologies may violate user privacy if personal data they produce and use become available to unauthorised agents. Recording provenance of IoT system behaviour may support assessment mechanisms ensuring compliance of system components with data access constraints. In this paper, we describe a prototype implementation of a provenance-enabled MQTT broker enhanced with the ability to generate provenance records describing the actual broker behaviour during message forwarding. The implementation utilises a semantic stream based approach for generating and analysing provenance data to discover message forwarding to untrusted agents. The initial evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of semantic solutions in this context.

AB  - The advancement of science as outlined by Popper and Kuhn is largely qualitative, but with bibliometric data it is possible and desirable to develop a quantitative picture of scientific progress. Furthermore it is also important to allocate finite resources to research topics that have growth potential, to accelerate the process from scientific breakthroughs to technological innovations. In this paper, we address this problem of quantitative knowledge evolution by analysing the APS publication data set from 1981 to 2010. We build the bibliographic coupling and co-citation networks, use the Louvain method to detect topical clusters (TCs) in each year, measure the similarity of TCs in consecutive years, and visualize the results as alluvial diagrams. Having the predictive features describing a given TC and its known evolution in the next year, we can train a machine learning model to predict future changes of TCs, i.e., their continuing, dissolving, merging and splitting. We found the number of papers from certain journals, the degree, closeness, and betweenness to be the most predictive features. Additionally, betweenness increases significantly for merging events, and decreases significantly for splitting events. Our results represent a first step from a descriptive understanding of the Science of Science (SciSci), towards one that is ultimately prescriptive.

AB  - Several real-world problems in domain of healthcare, large scale scientific simulations, and manufacturing are organised as workflow applications. Efficiently managing workflow applications on the Cloud computing data-centres is challenging due to the following problems: (i) they need to perform computation over sensitive data (e.g., Healthcare workflows) hence leading to additional security and legal risks especially considering public cloud environments and (ii) the dynamism of the cloud environment can lead to several run-time problems such as data loss and abnormal termination of workflow task due to failures of computing, storage, and network services. To tackle above challenges, this paper proposes a novel workflow management framework call Deploy on Federated Cloud Framework (DoFCF) that can dynamically partition scientific workflows across federated cloud (public/private) data-centres for minimising the financial cost, adhering to security requirements, while gracefully handling run-time failures. The framework is validated in cloud simulation tool (CloudSim) as well as in a realistic workflow-based cloud platform (e-Science Central). The results showed that our approach is practical and is successful in meeting users security requirements and reduces overall cost, and dynamically adapts to the run-time failures.

AB  - Abstract Scientific discovery is shaped by scientists’ choices and thus by their career patterns. The increasing knowledge required to work at the frontier of science makes it harder for an individual to embark on unexplored paths. Yet collaborations can reduce learning costs—albeit at the expense of increased coordination costs. In this article, we use data on the publication histories of a very large sample of physicists to measure the effects of knowledge and social relatedness on their diversification strategies. Using bipartite networks, we compute a measure of topic similarity and a measure of social proximity. We find that scientists’ strategies are not random, and that they are significantly affected by both. Knowledge relatedness across topics explains $$\approx 10\%$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>≈</mml:mo> <mml:mn>10</mml:mn> <mml:mo>%</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> of logistic regression deviances and social relatedness as much as $$\approx 30\%$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>≈</mml:mo> <mml:mn>30</mml:mn> <mml:mo>%</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> , suggesting that science is an eminently social enterprise: when scientists move out of their core specialization, they do so through collaborations. Interestingly, we also find a significant negative interaction between knowledge and social relatedness, suggesting that the farther scientists move from their specialization, the more they rely on collaborations. Our results provide a starting point for broader quantitative analyses of scientific diversification strategies, which could also be extended to the domain of technological innovation—offering insights from a comparative and policy perspective.

AB  - Abstract Understanding the nature and value of scientific collaboration is essential for sound management and proactive research policies. One component of collaboration is the composition and diversity of contributing authors. This study explores how ethnic diversity in scientific collaboration affects scientific impact, by presenting a conceptual model to connect ethnic diversity, based on author names, with scientific impact, assuming novelty and audience diversity as mediators. The model also controls for affiliated country diversity and affiliated country size. Using path modeling, we apply the model to the Web of Science subject categories Nanoscience &amp; Nanotechnology , Ecology and Information Science &amp; Library . For all three subject categories, and regardless of if control variables are considered or not, we find a weak positive relationship between ethnic diversity and scientific impact. The relationship is weaker, however, when control variables are included. For all three fields, the mediated effect through audience diversity is substantially stronger than the mediated effect through novelty in the relationship, and the former effect is much stronger than the direct effect between the ethnic diversity and scientific impact. Our findings further suggest that ethnic diversity is more associated with short-term scientific impact compared to long-term scientific impact.

AB  - Data is central in almost all scientific disciplines nowadays. Furthermore, intelligent systems have developed rapidly in recent years, so that in many disciplines the expectation is emerging that with the help of intelligent systems, significant challenges can be overcome and science can be done in completely new ways. In order for this to succeed, however, first, fundamental research in computer science is still required, and, second, generic tools must be developed on which specialized solutions can be built. In this paper, we introduce a recently started collaborative project funded by the Carl Zeiss Foundation, a virtual manufactory for digitization in the sciences, the “Werkstatt”, which is being established at the Michael Stifel Center Jena (MSCJ) for data-driven and simulation science to address fundamental questions in computer science and applications. The Werkstatt focuses on three key areas, which include generic tools for machine learning, knowledge generation using machine learning processes, and semantic methods for the data life cycle, as well as the application of these topics in different disciplines. Core and pilot projects address the key aspects of the topics and form the basis for sustainable work in the Werkstatt.

AB  - The worldwide web is an extraordinary resource for gaining access to information of all kinds.Each day a greater number of resources become available online.The advantages that internet offers researchers are tremendous; so much that some may be tempted to bypass the library entirely and conduct all their research on the web.In spite of this, the enquirers are being confronted with information overloaded with noise which the conventional search methods lack the capability to tackle.Existing search engines such as Google, Yahoo and Bing often return a long list of results which forces users to sift through it to find relevant documents; thereby making search for information difficult.This paper takes a critical study of document tracking and classification systems and presents a Neuro-fuzzy based model for classification of search results based on the strength of words in the query.The structured systems analysis and design methodology and the neuro-fuzzy clustering technique were employed to study and classify the documents into groups of similar topics for specific knowledge.The work built an adaptive intelligent information retrieval system which will cluster internet documents into similar topic using an unsupervised machine learning techniques to reduce the percentage of irrelevant documents that are retrieved and presented to users.

AB  - With the sudden growth of the internet and digital documents available on the web, the task of organizing text data has become a major problem.In recent times, text classification has become one of the main techniques for organizing text data.The idea behind text classification is to classify a given piece of text to a predefined class or category.In the present research work, SVM has been used with linear kernel using the One-V-Rest strategy.The SVM is trained using various data sets collected from various sources.It may so happen that some particular words were not so common around 5-6 years ago, but are currently prevalent due to recent trends.Similarly, new discoveries may result in the coinage of new words.This process can also be applied to text blogs which can be crawled and then analyzed.This technique should in theory be able to classify blogs, tweets or any other document with a significant amount of accuracy.In any text classification process, preprocessing phase takes the most amount of timecleaning, stemming, lemmatization etc.Hence, the authors have used a multithreading approach to speed up the process.The authors further tried to improve the processing time of the algorithm using GPU parallelism using CUDA.

AB  - Does the rise of open access journals change the way researchers collaborate? Specifically, since publishing in open access journals requires a publication fee, does income affect how researchers form international collaborations? To answer this question, we create a new data set by scraping bibliographic data from Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI) journals. Using the four income group classifications from the World Bank Analytical Classifications, we find that researchers from low-income nations are more likely to form international collaborations than researchers from wealthier nations. This result is verified to be significant using a series of pairwise Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests. We then study which nations most frequently form international collaborations with other nations and find that the USA, China, Germany, and France are the most preferred nations for forming international collaborations. While most nations prefer to form international collaborations with high-income nations, some exceptions exist, where a nation most often forms international collaborations with a nearby nation that is either an upper-middle-income or lower-middle-income nation. We further this analysis by showing that these results are apparent across the six different research categories established in the Frascati Manual. Finally, trends in publications in MDPI journals mirror trends seen in all journals, such as the continued increase in the percentage of published papers involving international collaboration.

AB  - Many individuals, including researchers, professors, and students, encounter difficulties when searching for scholarly documents, papers, and journals within a specific domain. Consequently, scholars have begun to focus on document classification problem, offering various methods to address this issue. Researchers have utilized diverse data sources, such as citations, metadata, content, and hybrids, in their approaches.In these sources, the meta-data-based approach stands out for research paper classification due to its availability at no cost. Various scholars have employed different metadata parameters of research articles, including the title, abstract, keywords, and general terms, for research paper classification. In this study, we chose four meta-data-based features such as, title, keyword, abstract, and general terms from the SANTOS dataset, which was prepared by ACM. To represent these features numerically, we employed a semantic-based model called BERT instead of the commonly used count-based models. BERT generates a 768-dimensional vector for each record, which introduces significant time complexity during computation. Additionally, our proposed model optimizes the features using a genetic algorithm. Optimal feature selection performances a crucial role in this domain, enhancing the overall accuracy of the document classification system while reducing the time complexity associated with selecting the most relevant features from this large-dimensional space. For classification purposes, we employed GNB and SVM classifiers. The outcomes of our study exposed that the combination of title and keywords outperformed other combinations.

AB  - This study aims to estimate the scientific productivity of collective subjects. The objective is to build a method for evaluating scientific productivity through calculation, including for new collective subjects with a small citation network—the paper proposes the Time-Weighted PageRank method with citation intensity (TWPR-CI). The Citation Network Dataset (ver. 13) has been analyzed to verify the method. The dataset includes more than 5 million scientific publications and 48 million citations. Four classes of collective subjects (more than 27,000 collective subjects in total) were established. For each class, scientific productivity estimates from 2000 to 2021 were calculated using the PageRank, Time-Weighted PageRank, and TWPR-CI methods. It is shown that the advantage of the TWPR-CI method is the higher sensitivity of the scientific productivity estimates for new collective subjects on average during the first ten years of observation. At the same time, the assessment of scientific productivity for other collective subjects according to this method is stable. However, the small citation network of the new collective subjects prevents the adequate assessment of scientific productivity during the first years of its operation. Therefore, the TWPR-CI method can be used to assess the scientific productivity of collective subjects, in particular the productivity of new ones.

AB  - The study of topic evolution aims to analyze the behavior of different research fields by utilizing various features such as the relationships between articles. In recent years, many published papers consider more than one field of study which has led to a significant increase in the number of inter-field and interdisciplinary articles. Therefore, we can analyze the similarity/dissimilarity and convergence/divergence of research fields based on topic analysis of the published papers. Our research intends to create a methodology for studying the evolution of the research fields. In this paper, we propose an embedding approach for modeling each research topics as a multidimensional vector. Using this model, we measure the topic's distances over the years and investigate how topics evolve over time. The proposed similarity metric showed many advantages over other alternatives (such as Jaccard similarity) and it resulted in better stability and accuracy. As a case study, we applied the proposed method to subsets of computer science for experimental purposes, and the results were quite comprehensible and coherent.

AB  - Scientific research communities are embracing AI-based solutions to target tractable scientific tasks and improve research workflows. However, the development and evaluation of such solutions are scattered across multiple disciplines. We formalize the problem of scientific AI benchmarking, and propose a system called SAIBench in the hope of unifying the efforts and enabling low-friction on-boarding of new disciplines. The system approaches this goal with SAIL, a domain-specific language to decouple research problems, AI models, ranking criteria, and software/hardware configuration into reusable modules. We show that this approach is flexible and can adapt to problems, AI models, and evaluation methods defined in different perspectives. The project homepage is https://www.computercouncil.org/SAIBench

AB  - Due to its quantitative nature, bibliometrics is becoming increasingly popular among policy makers for academic hiring and career promotions. In this article, we quantitatively assess the impact that the granularity level in the classification of scientific areas would entail on research evaluation based on bibliometric indicators. We use as a case study the Italian national habilitation system (ASN), which classifies faculty members according to their academic discipline and relies on journal counts, citations, and h-indices as a basis for promoting tenure track researchers to associate professors and associate to full professors. The assessment checks whether the individual indicators of a researcher are above a certain threshold, e.g., the median over the population of researchers working in the same discipline. Our investigation focuses on two related, rather broad disciplines: computer science and computer engineering. We show that the ASN practice of using the same thresholds for all members of a scientific discipline can favor certain sub-communities that are characterized by higher bibliometric indicators, and disfavor others. We report evidence that up to 30% of Italian faculty members of certain sub-communities would see their indicators drop below the threshold, thus becoming not eligible for promotion, if the ASN were conducted on a more accurate, fine-grained classification. Conversely, in the same scenario, up to 11% of faculty members, in different sub-communities, would see their indicators rise above the threshold, granting them eligibility. Our data set includes 1685 authors, 89,185 distinct publications, and 262,286 author-publication pairs.

AB  - With the continued rise of scientific computing and the enormous increases in the size of data being processed, scientists must consider whether the processes for transmitting and storing data sufficiently assure the integrity of the scientific data. When integrity is not preserved, computations can fail and result in increased computational cost due to reruns, or worse, results can be corrupted in a manner not apparent to the scientist and produce invalid science results. Technologies such as TCP checksums, encrypted transfers, checksum validation, RAID and erasure coding provide integrity assurances at different levels, but they may not scale to large data sizes and may not cover a workflow from end-to-end, leaving gaps in which data corruption can occur undetected. In this paper we explore an approach of assuring data integrity - considering either malicious or accidental corruption - for workflow executions orchestrated by the Pegasus Workflow Management System. To validate our approach, we introduce Chaos Jungle - a toolkit providing an environment for validating integrity verification mechanisms by allowing researchers to introduce a variety of integrity errors during data transfers and storage. In addition to controlled experiments with Chaos Jungle, we provide analysis of integrity errors that we encountered when running production workflows.

AB  - One of the most widely used measures of scientific impact is the number of citations. However, due to its heavy-tailed distribution, citations are fundamentally difficult to predict but can be improved. This study was aimed at investigating the factors and parts influencing the citation number of a scientific paper in the otology field. Therefore, this work proposes a new solution that utilizes machine learning and natural language processing to process English text and provides a paper citation as the predicted results. Different algorithms are implemented in this solution, such as linear regression, boosted decision tree, decision forest, and neural networks. The application of neural network regression revealed that papers' abstracts have more influence on the citation numbers of otological articles. This new solution has been developed in visual programming using Microsoft Azure machine learning at the back end and Programming Without Coding Technology at the front end. We recommend using machine learning models to improve the abstracts of research articles to get more citations.

AB  - Deep learning (DL) applications, built upon a heterogeneous and complex DL stack (e.g., Nvidia GPU, Linux, CUDA driver, Python runtime, and TensorFlow), are subject to software and hardware dependencies across the DL stack. One challenge in dependency management across the entire engineering lifecycle is posed by the asynchronous and radical evolution and the complex version constraints among dependencies. Developers may introduce dependency bugs (DBs) in selecting, using and maintaining dependencies. However, the characteristics of DBs in DL stack is still under-investigated, hindering practical solutions to dependency management in DL stack. To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive study to characterize symptoms, root causes and fix patterns of DBs across the whole DL stack with 446 DBs collected from StackOverflow posts and GitHub issues. For each DB, we first investigate the symptom as well as the lifecycle stage and dependency where the symptom is exposed. Then, we analyze the root cause as well as the lifecycle stage and dependency where the root cause is introduced. Finally, we explore the fix pattern and the knowledge sources that are used to fix it. Our findings from this study shed light on practical implications on dependency management.

AB  - Despite the shortcomings and criticisms of world university rankings, such metrics are widely used by students and parents to select institutions and by educational institutions to attract talented students and researchers, as well as funding. This article introduces the first contrast pattern-based scientometric study of world university rankings. Specifically, this study collects a database containing 34 features, which describe the essential research indicators for the top 200 universities in the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) ranking. The use of 18 state-of-the-art classifiers in this database shows that the top 100 universities in the QS World University Rankings are separable from the remaining compared universities, achieving an average accuracy of 71%. Additionally, using a contrast pattern mining algorithm, a set of patterns describing the top 100 universities is extracted based on scientometric features. Additionally, this study proposes an approach for visualizing the extracted patterns to facilitate the decision-makers, such as senior university managers, in formulating and evaluating their research (ranking) strategies.

AB  - To identify common temporal evolution profiles in biological data and propose a semi-automated method to these patterns in a clinical data warehouse (CDW). We leveraged the CDW of the European Hospital Georges Pompidou and tracked the evolution of 192 biological parameters over a period of 17 years (for 445,000 + patients, and 131 million laboratory test results). We identified three common profiles of evolution: discretization, breakpoints, and trends. We developed computational and statistical methods to identify these profiles in the CDW. Overall, of the 192 observed biological parameters (87,814,136 values), 135 presented at least one evolution. We identified breakpoints in 30 distinct parameters, discretizations in 32, and trends in 79. our method allowed the identification of several temporal events in the data. Considering the distribution over time of these events, we identified probable causes for the observed profiles: instruments or software upgrades and changes in computation formulas. We evaluated the potential impact for data reuse. Finally, we formulated recommendations to enable safe use and sharing of biological data collection to limit the impact of data evolution in retrospective and federated studies (e.g. the annotation of laboratory parameters presenting breakpoints or trends).

AB  - Aiming at the problems of diversification, complexity and islanding of power operation and inspection data and the high dependence of operation and inspection operations on expert experience and normative information, the key technology research of intelligent judgment of defect types of power operation inspection equipment is carried out. For the field of power operation and inspection, the defect text classification algorithm based on graph convolutional neural network is proposed. And the practical tests in a large defect text network diagram built by main transformer defect reports are performed. And the proposed model achieves better classification results than 7 benchmark models in the defect text classification task. Specifically, the Accuracy, Weighed-Precision, and Weighed-F1 indicators reach 73.39, 72.42, and 72.21 respectively, which improves the model’s ability to identify defect types to a greater extent and plays an important role in improving the intelligence and digitalization of power operation and inspection work.

AB  - Abstract In the last decades, research in science mapping has delivered several powerful techniques, based on citation or textual analysis, for charting the intellectual organization of research fields. To map the social network underlying science and scholarship, by contrast, science mapping has mainly relied on one method, co-authorship analysis. This method, however, suffers from well-known limitations related to the practice of authorship. Moreover, it does not perform well on those fields where multi-authored publications are rare. In this study, a new method for mapping the social structure of research fields is advanced, based on the analysis of the acknowledgments of academic publications. We first discuss the standard account of the function of acknowledgments in scholarly communication, then we introduce a new interpretative framework in which the acknowledgments are intended as positioning signals exchanged by researchers. Next, we provide the formal definition of the four acknowledgments-based networks that stand at the core of the method, and we test it on a humanities field, analytic philosophy. Results show that acknowledgement-based networks allow to reconstruct the fine-grained social structure of analytic philosophy from different perspectives. Furthermore, by comparing the citation-based maps of the field with the acknowledgments-based networks, it permits to shed light on the relationship between the intellectual and social layer of analytic philosophy. We conclude by presenting practical limitations of the method and by sketching some further research lines.

AB  - This paper introduces the use of co-nomination as a method to map research fields by directly accessing their knowledge networks organised around exchange relationships of intellectual influence. Co-nomination is a reputation-based approach combining snowball sampling and social network analysis. It compliments established bibliometric mapping methods by addressing some of their typical shortcomings in specific instances. Here we test co-nomination by mapping one such instance: the idiosyncratic field of CERN-based heavy flavour physics (HFP). HFP is a 'hyper-authorship' field where papers conventionally list thousands of authors alphabetically, masking individual intellectual contributions. We also undertook an illustrative author co-citation analysis (ACA) mapping of 2310 HFP articles published 2013–18 and identified using a simple keyword query. Both maps were presented to two HFP scientists for commentary upon structure and validity. Our results suggest co-nomination allows us to access individual-level intellectual influence and discern the experimental and theoretical HFP branches. Co-nomination is powerful in uncovering current and emerging research specialisms in HFP that might remain opaque to other methods. ACA, however, better captures HFP's historical and intellectual foundations. We conclude by discussing possible future uses of co-nomination in science policy and research evaluation arrangements.

AB  - The main goals and challenges for the life science communities in the Open Science framework are to increase reuse and sustainability of data resources, software tools, and workflows, especially in large-scale data-driven research and computational analyses. Here, we present key findings, procedures, effective measures and recommendations for generating and establishing sustainable life science resources based on the collaborative, cross-disciplinary work done within the EOSC-Life (European Open Science Cloud for Life Sciences) consortium. Bringing together 13 European life science research infrastructures, it has laid the foundation for an open, digital space to support biological and medical research. Using lessons learned from 27 selected projects, we describe the organisational, technical, financial and legal/ethical challenges that represent the main barriers to sustainability in the life sciences. We show how EOSC-Life provides a model for sustainable data management according to FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) principles, including solutions for sensitive- and industry-related resources, by means of cross-disciplinary training and best practices sharing. Finally, we illustrate how data harmonisation and collaborative work facilitate interoperability of tools, data, solutions and lead to a better understanding of concepts, semantics and functionalities in the life sciences.

AB  - This paper introduces Amharic Text Summarization for News Items posted on social media, to summarize the news items posted Amharic texts over a time posted documents from social media on Twitter and Facebook; The main problems of the social media posted texts are that most people would probably read their posted in Amharic texts with duplicate posted documents. However, to find the information the user is looking for she or he will have to find summary posted texts and read important portions of posts as Amharic documents to extract desired information on social media. Summarization is dealing with information overload presenting and posted with a text document for the current time representation of the posted documents to summarize. Our proposed approach has three main components: First, calculate the similarity between each posted document within the two pair of sentences. Second, clustering based on the similarity results of the documents to group them by using Kmeans algorithm. Third, summarizing the clustered posted document individually using TF-IDF algorithms that involve finding statistical ways for the frequent terms to rank the documents. We applied the summarization technique is an extractive summarization approach that is assigned an extract the sentences with highest ranked sentences in the posted documents to form the summaries and the size of the summary can be identified by the user. In the experiment one the highest F-measure score is 87.07% for extraction rate at 30%, in the clustered group of protests posts. The second experiment the highest F-measure score is 84% for extraction rate at 30%, in droughts post groups. In the third experiment the highest F-measure score is 91.37% for extraction rate at 30%, in the sports post groups and also the fourth experiments the highest F-measure score is 93.52% for extraction rate at 30% to generate the summary post texts. If the system to generate the size of summary is increased, the extraction rate also increased in posted texts. For this the evaluation system shown that a very good results to summaries the posted texts on social media.

AB  - Feature selection is critical in reducing the size of data and improving classifier accuracy by selecting an optimum subset of the overall features. Traditionally, each feature is given a score against a particular category (such as using Mutual Information) and the task of feature selection comes down to choosing the top $k$ ranked features with the best average score across all categories. However, this approach has two major drawbacks. Firstly, the maximum or average score of a feature with a class might not necessarily determine its discriminating strength among samples of other classes. Secondly, most feature selection methods only use the scores to select the discriminating features from the corpus without taking into account the redundancy of information provided by the selected features. In this paper, we propose a new feature ranking score measure called the Discriminative Mutual Information (DMI) score. This score helps to select features that distinguish samples of one category against all other categories. Moreover, Non-Redundant Feature Selection (NRFS) heuristic is also proposed that explicitly takes the problem of feature redundancy into account when selecting the features set. The performance of our approach is investigated and compared with other feature selection techniques on datasets derived from high-dimensional text corpora using multiple classification algorithms. The results show that the proposed method leads to better classification micro-F1 score as compared to other state-of-the-art methods. In particular, the proposed method shows great improvement when the number of selected features are small as well as an overall higher robustness to label noise.

AB  - Abstract The effect of research collaboration (RC) on citation impact (the citations that the scientific knowledge has received) has been studied over the years. However, the extant literature has not considered that the effect of RC can not be efficiently assessed if the level of development of the research and innovation system (RIS) of the collaborating countries is disregarded. I have addressed this gap by looking at the articles published by 36 countries and controlling for other variables that also influence citation impact. The results show that the higher the development of the RIS, the higher the citation impact, as measured by the percentile each article occupies in the respective Web of Science subject area, of single–authored articles and of articles with domestic research collaboration (DRC). The articles representing DRC always have a higher citation impact than single-authored articles, regardless of the level of development of RIS of the countries. Even the articles representing an international research collaboration do not always have a higher impact than single-authored articles; (1) there is no statistically significant difference between the citation impact of articles published in collaboration between scientists from countries considered strong innovators and modest innovators and the citation impact of single-authored articles of scientists from countries considered strong innovators; and (2) articles published by scientists from countries considered innovation leaders in collaboration with scientists from countries considered modest innovators have a lower impact than single-authored articles published by scientists from countries considered innovation leaders. In general, collaboration between scientists from countries with a well-developed RIS and those with a less developed RIS results in articles with a lower citation impact than articles with DRC originating from scientists from countries with a well-developed RIS and higher than articles with DRC originating from scientists from countries with a less developed RIS.

AB  - We analyze the changes in the training and educational efforts of the SciNet HPC Consortium, a Canadian academic High Performance Computing center, in the areas of Scientific Computing and High-Performance Computing, over the last six years.Initially, SciNet offered isolated training events on how to use HPC systems and write parallel code, but the training program now consists of a broad range of workshops and courses that users can take toward certificates in scientific computing, data science, or high-performance computing.Using data on enrollment, attendence, and certificate numbers from SciNet's education website, used by almost 1800 users so far, we extract trends on the growth, demand, and breadth of SciNet's training program.Among the results are a steady overall growth, a sharp and steady increase in the demand for data science training, and a wider participation of 'non-traditional' computing disciplines, which has motivated an increasingly broad spectrum of training offerings.Of interest is also that many of the training initiatives have evolved into courses that can be taken as part of the graduate curriculum at the University of Toronto.

AB  - The present study examines the intellectual structure of research on coronavirus as revealed from an author co-citation analysis using citation data retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection and mapped to the PubMed database. Four major dimensions are identified: (I) Outbreaks, (II) Viral structure and function, (III) Vaccine and therapeutic development, and (IV) Coronaviruses found in a range of animals. The "Outbreaks" dimension is by far the most prominent, dominated by reports on the three recent major outbreaks: COVID-19, SARS, and MERS. The focus of research on major outbreaks is on public health issues such as diagnosis, transmission, and clinical course. Research did not, however, stand out as a specialty or identifiable topic in the coronavirus research landscape identified here in a number of important areas, such as issues in mental health related to outbreaks. Results from this study should contribute to the understanding of the coronavirus research landscape and to the identification of strengths and weaknesses of current research on COVID-19.

AB  - Abstract Text classification is a crucial task in data mining and artificial intelligence. In recent years, deep learning-based text classification methods have made great development. The deep learning methods supervise model training by representing a label as a one-hot vector. However, the one-hot label representation cannot adequately reflect the relation between an instance and the labels, as labels are often not completely independent, and the instance may be associated with multiple labels in practice. Simply representing the labels as one-hot vectors leads to overconfidence in the model, making it difficult to distinguish some label confusions. In this paper, we propose a simulated label distribution method based on concepts (SLDC) to tackle this problem. This method captures the overlap between the labels by computing the similarity between an instance and the labels and generates a new simulated label distribution for assisting model training. In particular, we incorporate conceptual information from the knowledge base into the representation of instances and labels to address the surface mismatching problem when instances and labels are compared for similarity. Moreover, to fully use the simulated label distribution and the original label vector, we set up a multi-loss function to supervise the training process. Expensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SLDC on five complex text classification datasets. Further experiments also verify that SLDC is especially helpful for confused datasets.

AB  - Abstract Machine learning (ML) has already fundamentally changed several businesses. More recently, it has also been profoundly impacting the computational science and engineering domains, like geoscience, climate science, and health science. In these domains, users need to perform comprehensive data analyses combining scientific data and ML models to provide for critical requirements, such as reproducibility, model explainability, and experiment data understanding. However, scientific ML is multidisciplinary, heterogeneous, and affected by the physical constraints of the domain, making such analyses even more challenging. In this work, we leverage workflow provenance techniques to build a holistic view to support the lifecycle of scientific ML. We contribute with (i) characterization of the lifecycle and taxonomy for data analyses; (ii) design decisions to build this view, with a W3C PROV compliant data representation and a reference system architecture; and (iii) lessons learned after an evaluation in an Oil &amp; Gas case using an HPC cluster with 393 nodes and 946 GPUs. The experiments show that the decisions enable queries that integrate domain semantics with ML models while keeping low overhead (&lt;1%), high scalability, and an order of magnitude of query acceleration under certain workloads against without our representation.

AB  - Abstract Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) is a formidable task which involves classifying textual descriptions into a taxonomic hierarchy. Existing methods, however, have difficulty in adequately modeling the hierarchical label structures, because they tend to focus on employing graph embedding methods to encode the hierarchical structure while disregarding the fact that the HTC labels are rooted in a tree structure. This is significant because, unlike a graph, the tree structure inherently has a directive that ordains information flow from one node to another—a critical factor when applying graph embedding to the HTC task. But in the graph structure, message-passing is undirected, which will lead to the imbalance of message transmission between nodes when applied to HTC. To this end, we propose a unidirectional message-passing multi-label generation model for HTC, referred to as UMP-MG. Instead of viewing HTC as a classification problem as previous methods have done, this novel approach conceptualizes it as a sequence generation task, introducing prior hierarchical information during the decoding process. This further enables the blocking of information flow in one direction to ensure that the graph embedding method is better suited for the HTC task and thus resulted in the enhanced tree structure representation. Results obtained through experimentation on both the public WOS dataset and an E-commerce user intent classification dataset demonstrate that our proposed model can achieve superlative results.

AB  - In this paper we aim to provide an implementation of the FAIR Data Points (FDP) spec, that will apply our bias detection algorithm and automatically calculate a FAIRness score (FNS). FAIR metrics would be themselves represented as FDOs, and could be presented via a visual dashboard, and be machine accessible (Mons 2020, Wilkinson et al. 2016). This will enable dataset owners to monitor the level of FAIRness of their data. This is a step forward in making data FAIR, i.e., Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable; or simply, Fully AI Ready data. First we may discuss the context of this topic with respect to Deep Learning (DL) problems. Why are Bayesian Networks (BN, explained below) beneficial for such issues? Explainability – Obtaining a directed acyclic graph (DAG) from a BN training provides coherent information about independence variables in the data base. In a generic DL problem, features are functions of these variables. Thus, one can derive which variables are dominant in our system. When customers or business units are interested in the cause of a neural net outcome, this DAG structure can be both a source to provide importance and clarify the model. Dimension Reduction — BN provides the joint distribution of our variables and their associations. The latter may play a role in reducing the features that we induce to the DL engine: If we know that for random variables X,Y the conditional entropy of X in Y are low, we may omit X since Y provides its nearly entire information. We have, therefore, a tool that can statistically exclude redundant variables Tagging Behavior – This section can be less evident for those who work in domains such as vision or voice. In some frameworks, labeling can be an obscure task (to illustrate, consider a sentiment problem with many categories that may overlap). When we tag the data, we may rely on some features within the datasets and generate conditional probability. Training BN, when we initialize an empty DAG, may provide outcomes in which the target is a parent of other nodes. Observing several tested examples, these outcomes reflect these “taggers’ manners”. We can therefore use DAGs not merely for the purpose of model development in machine learning but mainly learning taggers policy and improve it if needed. The conjunction of DL and Casual inference — Causal Inference is a highly developed domain in data analytics. It offers tools to resolve questions that on the one hand, DL models commonly do not and, on the other hand, the real-world raises. There is a need to find a framework in which these tools will work in conjunction. Indeed, such frameworks already exist (e.g., GNN). But a mechanism that merges typical DL problems causality is less common. We believe that the flow, as described in this paper, is a good step in the direction of achieving benefits from this conjunction. Fairness and Bias – Bayesian networks, in their essence, are not a tool for bias detection but they reveal which of the columns (or which of the data items) is dominant and modify other variables. When we discuss noise and bias, we address these faults to the column and not to the model or to the entire data base. However, assume we have a set of tools to measure bias (Purian et al. 2022). Bayesian networks can provide information about the prominence of these columns (as they are “cause” or “effect” in the data), thus allow us to assess the overall bias in the database. Explainability – Obtaining a directed acyclic graph (DAG) from a BN training provides coherent information about independence variables in the data base. In a generic DL problem, features are functions of these variables. Thus, one can derive which variables are dominant in our system. When customers or business units are interested in the cause of a neural net outcome, this DAG structure can be both a source to provide importance and clarify the model. Dimension Reduction — BN provides the joint distribution of our variables and their associations. The latter may play a role in reducing the features that we induce to the DL engine: If we know that for random variables X,Y the conditional entropy of X in Y are low, we may omit X since Y provides its nearly entire information. We have, therefore, a tool that can statistically exclude redundant variables Tagging Behavior – This section can be less evident for those who work in domains such as vision or voice. In some frameworks, labeling can be an obscure task (to illustrate, consider a sentiment problem with many categories that may overlap). When we tag the data, we may rely on some features within the datasets and generate conditional probability. Training BN, when we initialize an empty DAG, may provide outcomes in which the target is a parent of other nodes. Observing several tested examples, these outcomes reflect these “taggers’ manners”. We can therefore use DAGs not merely for the purpose of model development in machine learning but mainly learning taggers policy and improve it if needed. The conjunction of DL and Casual inference — Causal Inference is a highly developed domain in data analytics. It offers tools to resolve questions that on the one hand, DL models commonly do not and, on the other hand, the real-world raises. There is a need to find a framework in which these tools will work in conjunction. Indeed, such frameworks already exist (e.g., GNN). But a mechanism that merges typical DL problems causality is less common. We believe that the flow, as described in this paper, is a good step in the direction of achieving benefits from this conjunction. Fairness and Bias – Bayesian networks, in their essence, are not a tool for bias detection but they reveal which of the columns (or which of the data items) is dominant and modify other variables. When we discuss noise and bias, we address these faults to the column and not to the model or to the entire data base. However, assume we have a set of tools to measure bias (Purian et al. 2022). Bayesian networks can provide information about the prominence of these columns (as they are “cause” or “effect” in the data), thus allow us to assess the overall bias in the database. What are Bayesian Networks? The motivation for using Bayesian Networks (BN) is to learn the dependencies within a set of random variables. The networks themselves are directed acyclic graphs (DAG), which mimic the joint distribution of the random variables (e.g., Perrier et al. (2008)). The graph structure follows the probabilistic dependencies factorization of the joint distribution: a node V depends only on its parents (a r.v X independent of the other nodes will be presented as a parent free node). Real-World Example In this paper we present a way of using the DL engine tabular data, with the python package bnlearn. Since this project is commercial, the variable names were masked; thus, they will have meaningless names. Constructing Our DAG We begin by finding our optimal DAG. import bnlearn as bn DAG = bn.structure_learning.fit(dataframe) We now have a DAG. It has a set of nodes and an adjacency matrix that can be found as follow: print(DAG[ 'adjmat' ]) The outcome has this form Fig. 1a. Where rows are sources (namely the direction of the arc is from the left column to the elements in the row) and columns are targets (i.e., the header of the column receives the arcs). When we begin drawing the obtained DAG, we get for one set of variables the following image: Fig. 1b. We can see that the target node in the rectangle is a source for many nodes. We can see that it still points arrows itself to two nodes. We will discuss this in the discussion (i.e., Rauber 2021). We have more variables, therefore I increased the number of nodes. Adding the information provided a new source for the target (i.e., its entire row is “False”). The obtained graph is the following: Fig. 1c. So, we know how to construct a DAG. Now we need to train its parameters. Code-wise we perform this as follows: model_mle = bn.parameter_learning.fit(DAG, dataframe, methodtype= 'maximumlikelihood' ) We can change ‘ maximulikelihood ’ with ‘ bayes ’ as described beyond. The outcome of this training is a set of factorized conditional distributions that reflect the DAG’s structure. It has this form for a given variable: Fig. 1d. The code to create DAG presentation is provided in Fig. 2. Discussion In this paper we have presented some of the theoretical concepts of Bayesian Networks and the usage they provide in constructing an approximated DAG for a set of variables. In addition, we presented a real-world example of end to end DAG learning: Constructing it using BN, training its parameters using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) methods, and performing and inference. FAIR metrics, represented as FDOs, can also be visualised and monitored, taking care of data FAIRness.

AB  - In the last decade, the research literature has reached an enormous volume with an unprecedented current annual increase of 1.5 million new publications. As research gets ever more global and new countries and institutions, either from academia or corporate environments, start to contribute, it is important to monitor this complex phenomenon and understand its dynamics and equilibria.We present a study on a conference proceedings dataset extracted from Springer Nature SciGraph that illustrates insightful geographical trends and highlights the unbalanced growth of competitive research institutions worldwide in the 1996–2016 period. The main contribution of this work is fourfold. In the first instance, we found that the distributions of institutions and publications among countries follow a power law, consistently with previous literature, i.e., very few countries keep producing most of the papers accepted by high-tier conferences. Secondly, we show how the turnover rate of country rankings is extremely low and steadily declines over time, suggesting an alarmingly static landscape in which new entries struggle to emerge. We also performed an analysis of the venue locations and their effect on the distribution of countries involved in the publications, underlining the central role of Europe and China as knowledge hubs. Finally, we evidence the presence of an increasing gap between the number of institutions initiating and overseeing research endeavours (i.e. first and last authors’ affiliations) and the total number of institutions participating in research.The paper also discusses our experience in working with authors’ affiliations: an utterly simple matter at first glance, that is instead revealed to be a complex research and technical challenge.

AB  - Due to the increasing popularity of new research in medicine thisstudy was conducted to determine recent research trends of predictive, preventive and personalized medicine (PPM). We identified the terms relevant to PPM using own search engine based on neural network processing in PubMed database. We extracted initially about 15000 articles. Then we carried out the statistical analysis for identifying research trends. The article presents the results of solving the problem of evaluating research topics at the level of thematic clusters in a separate subject area. An approach based on the analysis of article titles has been implemented. Identification of terms, connections between them and thematic clustering were carried out using the free software VOSViewer, which allows to extract terms in the form of noun phrases, as well as to cluster them.

AB  - In multi-target prediction, an instance has to be classified along multiple target variables at the same time, where each target represents a category or numerical value. There are several strategies to tackle multi-target prediction problems: the local strategy learns a separate model for each target variable independently, while the global strategy learns a single model for all target variables together. Previous studies suggested that the global strategy should be preferred because (1) learning is more efficient, (2) the learned models are more compact, and (3) it overfits much less than the local strategy, as it is harder to overfit on several targets at the same time than on one target. However, it is not clear whether the global strategy exploits correlations between the targets optimally. In this paper, we investigate whether better results can be obtained by learning multiple multi-target models on several partitions of the targets. To answer this question, we first determined alternative partitions using an exhaustive search strategy and a strategy based on a genetic algorithm, and then compared the results of the global and local strategies against these. We used decision trees and random forests as base models. The results show that it is possible to outperform global and local approaches, but finding a good partition without incurring in overfitting remains a challenging task.

AB  - Technology-assisted review (TAR) is an important industrial application of information retrieval (IR) and machine learning (ML). While a small TAR research community exists, the complexity of TAR software and workflows is a major barrier to entry. Drawing on past open source TAR efforts, as well as design patterns from the IR and ML open source software, we present an open source Python framework for conducting experiments on TAR algorithms. Key characteristics of this framework are declarative representations of workflows and experiment plans, the ability for components to play variable numbers of workflow roles, and state maintenance and restart capabilities. Users can draw on reference implementations of standard TAR algorithms while incorporating novel components to explore their research interests. The framework is available at https://github.com/eugene-yang/tarexp.

AB  - Scientific Workflow is a composition of both coarse-grained and fine-grained computational tasks displaying varying execution requirements. Large-scale data transfer is involved in scientific workflows, so efficient techniques are required to reduce the makespan of the workflow. Task clustering is an efficient technique used in such a scenario that involves combining multiple tasks with shorter execution time into a single cluster to be executed on a resource. This leads to a reduction of scheduling overheads in scientific workflows and thus improvement of performance. However available task clustering methods involve clustering the tasks horizontally without the consideration of the structure of tasks in a workflow. We propose hybrid balanced task clustering algorithm that uses the parameter of impact factor of workflows along with the structure of workflow. According to this technique, tasks can be considered for clustering either vertically or horizontally based on the value of the impact factor. This minimizes the system overheads and the makespan for execution of a workflow. A simulation based evaluation is performed on real workflows that shows the proposed algorithm is efficient in recommending clusters. It shows improvement of 5-10\% in makespan time of workflow depending on the type of workflow used.

VOSviewer software, advanced bibliometric text mining, and visualization techniques were used to evaluate the thematic structure. We collected data about the country and institutional affiliation of all the authors and calculated production and citation impact indicators.85,697 papers were analyzed. Eleven thematic clusters were identified: 1) "health care and education"; 2) "biomechanics"; 3) "psychosocial, chronic pain and quality of life outcomes"; 4) "evidence-based physical therapy research methods"; 5) "traumatology and orthopedics"; 6) "neurological rehabilitation"; 7) "psychometrics and cross-cultural adaptation"; 8) "gait-balance analysis and Parkinson's disease"; 9) "exercise"; 10) "respiratory physical therapy"; and 11) "back pain." The United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia were the most productive countries. Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden had the highest citation impact.Our bibliometric visualization approach makes it possible to comprehensively study the thematic structure of physical therapy. The ranking of producers has evolved and now includes China and Brazil. High research production does not imply a high citation impact.

AB  - The biomedical literature is expanding at ever-increasing rates, and it has become extremely challenging for researchers to keep abreast of new data and discoveries even in their own domains of expertise. We introduce PaperBot, a configurable, modular, open-source crawler to automatically find and efficiently index peer-reviewed publications based on periodic full-text searches across publisher web portals. PaperBot may operate stand-alone or it can be easily integrated with other software platforms and knowledge bases. Without user interactions, PaperBot retrieves and stores the bibliographic information (full reference, corresponding email contact, and full-text keyword hits) based on pre-set search logic from a wide range of sources including Elsevier, Wiley, Springer, PubMed/PubMedCentral, Nature, and Google Scholar. Although different publishing sites require different search configurations, the common interface of PaperBot unifies the process from the user perspective. Once saved, all information becomes web accessible allowing efficient triage of articles based on their actual relevance and seamless annotation of suitable metadata content. The platform allows the agile reconfiguration of all key details, such as the selection of search portals, keywords, and metadata dimensions. The tool also provides a one-click option for adding articles manually via digital object identifier or PubMed ID. The microservice architecture of PaperBot implements these capabilities as a loosely coupled collection of distinct modules devised to work separately, as a whole, or to be integrated with or replaced by additional software. All metadata is stored in a schema-less NoSQL database designed to scale efficiently in clusters by minimizing the impedance mismatch between relational model and in-memory data structures. As a testbed, we deployed PaperBot to help identify and manage peer-reviewed articles pertaining to digital reconstructions of neuronal morphology in support of the NeuroMorpho.Org data repository. PaperBot enabled the custom definition of both general and neuroscience-specific metadata dimensions, such as animal species, brain region, neuron type, and digital tracing system. Since deployment, PaperBot helped NeuroMorpho.Org more than quintuple the yearly volume of processed information while maintaining a stable personnel workforce.

AB  - P2P networks have become a commonly used way of disseminating content on the Internet. In this context, constructing efficient and distributed P2P routing algorithms for complex environments that include a huge number of distributed nodes with different computing and network capabilities is a major challenge. In the last years, query routing algorithms have evolved by taking into account different features (provenance, nodes? history, topic similarity, etc.). Such features are usually stored in auxiliary data structures (tables, matrices, etc.), which provide an extra knowledge engineering layer on top of the network, resulting in an added semantic value for specifying algorithms for efficient query routing. This article examines the main existing algorithms for query routing in unstructured P2P networks in which semantic aspects play a major role. A general comparative analysis is included, associated with a taxonomy of P2P networks based on their degree of decentralization and the different approaches adopted to exploit the available semantic aspects.

AB  - Abstract Empirical economics and econometrics (EEE) research now relies primarily on the application of code to data sets. Handling the workflow that links data sets, programs, results, and finally manuscript(s) is essential if one wishes to reproduce results. Herein, we highlight the importance of “reproducible research” in EEE and propose three simple principles to follow: organize your work, code for others, and automate as much as you can. The first principle, “organize your work”, deals with the overall organization of files and the documentation of a research workflow. “Code for others” emphasizes that we should take care in how we write code that has to be read by others or later by our future self. Finally, “automate as much as you can” is a proposal to avoid any manual treatment and to automate most, if not all, of the steps used in a research process to reduce errors and increase reproducibility. As software is not always the problem and will never be the solution, we illustrate these principles with good habits and tools, with a particular focus on their implementation in most popular software and languages in applied economics.

AB  - In this paper, a non-negative matrix factorization feature expansion (NMFFE) approach was proposed to overcome the feature-sparsity issue when expanding features of short-text. First, we took the internal relationships of short texts and words into account when segmenting words from texts and constructing their relationship matrix. Second, we utilized the Dual regularization non-negative matrix tri-factorization (DNMTF) algorithm to obtain the words clustering indicator matrix, which was used to get the feature space by dimensionality reduction methods. Thirdly, words with close relationship were selected out from the feature space and added into the short-text to solve the sparsity issue. The experimental results showed that the accuracy of short text classification of our NMFFE algorithm increased 25.77%, 10.89%, and 1.79% on three data sets: Web snippets, Twitter sports, and AGnews, respectively compared with the Word2Vec algorithm and Char-CNN algorithm. It indicated that the NMFFE algorithm was better than the BOW algorithm and the Char-CNN algorithm in terms of classification accuracy and algorithm robustness.

AB  - Automatic topic classification has been studied extensively to assist managing and indexing scientific documents in a digital collection. With the large number of topics being available in recent years, it has become necessary to arrange them in a hierarchy. Therefore, the automatic classification systems need to be able to classify the documents hierarchically. In addition, each paper is often assigned to more than one relevant topic. For example, a paper can be assigned to several topics in a hierarchy tree. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset for hierarchical multi-label text classification (HMLTC) of scientific papers called SciHTC, which contains 186,160 papers and 1,234 categories from the ACM CCS tree. We establish strong baselines for HMLTC and propose a multi-task learning approach for topic classification with keyword labeling as an auxiliary task. Our best model achieves a Macro-F1 score of 34.57% which shows that this dataset provides significant research opportunities on hierarchical scientific topic classification. We make our dataset and code for all experiments publicly available.

AB  - In recent years, the pre-training-then-fine-tuning paradigm has yielded immense success on a wide spectrum of cross-modal tasks, such as visual question answering (VQA), in which a visual-language (VL) model is first optimized via self-supervised task objectives, e.g., masked language modeling (MLM) and image-text matching (ITM), and then fine-tuned to adapt to downstream task (e.g., VQA) via a brand-new objective function, e.g., answer prediction. However, the inconsistency of the objective forms not only severely limits the generalization of pre-trained VL models to downstream tasks, but also requires a large amount of labeled data for fine-tuning. To alleviate the problem, we propose an innovative VL fine-tuning paradigm (named Declaration-based Prompt Tuning, abbreviated as DPT), which fine-tunes the model for downstream VQA using the pre-training objectives, boosting the effective adaptation of pre-trained models to the downstream task. Specifically, DPT reformulates the VQA task via (1) textual adaptation, which converts the given questions into declarative sentence form for prompt-tuning, and (2) task adaptation, which optimizes the objective function of VQA problem in the manner of pre-training phase. Experimental results on GQA dataset show that DPT outperforms the fine-tuned counterpart by a large margin regarding accuracy in both fully-supervised (2.68%) and zero-shot/fewshot (over 31%) settings. All the data and codes will be available to facilitate future research.

AB  - In highly dynamic environments, systems are expected to make decisions on the fly based on their observations that are bound to be partial. As such, the reasons for its runtime behaviour may be difficult to understand. In these cases, accountability is crucial, and decisions by the system need to be traceable. Logging is essential to support explanations of behaviour, but it poses challenges. Concerns about analysing massive logs have motivated the introduction of structured logging, however, knowing what to log and which details to include is still a challenge. Structured logs still do not necessarily relate events to each other, or indicate time intervals. We argue that logging changes to a runtime model in a provenance graph can mitigate some of these problems. The runtime model keeps only relevant details, therefore reducing the volume of the logs, while the provenance graph records causal connections between the changes and the activities performed by the agents in the system that have introduced them. In this paper, we demonstrate a first version towards a reusable infrastructure for the automated construction of such a provenance graph. We apply it to a multithreaded traffic simulation case study, with multiple concurrent agents managing different parts of the simulation. We show how the provenance graphs can support validating the system behaviour, and how a seeded fault is reflected in the provenance graphs.

AB  - This paper presents the results of a method for the visualization of the long-term prediction of research trending topics. Meaningful topics were identified among the words included in the titles of scientific articles. The title is the most important element of a scientific article and the main indication of the article’s subject and topic. We treated the titles’ words, which occur several times in articles cited in the analyzed collection, as the research trending topics. The longevity of the citation trend growth was the target for the machine learning algorithms. The CatBoost machine learning method, which is one of the best implementations of decision trees, was used. We conducted experiments on a scientific dataset that included 5 million publications from the top conferences in artificial intelligence and data mining areas to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The accuracy rate of three-year forecasts for a number of experiments from 1997 to 2014 was about 60%. To visualize the forecast, the t-SNE and Word2Vec methods were used. Clusters of trending keywords on the semantic map helped to accurately identify promising directions. Two examples of forecast visualizations for the topic “Intelligent methods for data and image analysis” are presented. The presented visualizations serve as the analytical method for predicting topic trends and promising directions.

AB  - In recent years, the science of science policy has been facilitated by the greater availability of and access to digital data associated with the science, technology, and innovation enterprise. Historically, most of the studies from which such data are derived have been econometric or "scientometric" in nature, focusing on the development of quantitative data, models, and metrics of the scientific process as well as outputs and outcomes. Broader definitions of research impact, however, necessitate the use of qualitative case-study methods. For many years, U.S. federal science agencies such as the National Institutes of Health have demonstrated the impact of the research they support through tracing studies that document critical events in the development of successful technologies. A significant disadvantage and barrier of such studies is the labor-intensive nature of a case study approach. Currently, however, the same data infrastructures that have been developed to support scientometrics may also facilitate historical tracing studies. In this paper, we describe one approach we used to discover long-term, downstream outcomes of research supported in the late 1970's and early 1980's by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, a component of the National Institutes of Health.

AB  - Abstract Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most momentous technologies of our time. Thus, it is of major importance to know which stakeholders influence AI research. Besides researchers at universities and colleges, researchers in companies have hardly been considered in this context. In this article, we consider how the influence of companies on AI research can be made measurable on the basis of scientific publishing activities. We compare academic- and company-authored AI publications published in the last decade and use scientometric data from multiple scholarly databases to look for differences across these groups and to disclose the top contributing organizations. While the vast majority of publications is still produced by academia, we find that the citation count an individual publication receives is significantly higher when it is (co–)authored by a company. Furthermore, using a variety of altmetric indicators, we notice that publications with company participation receive considerably more attention online. Finally, we place our analysis results in a broader context and present targeted recommendations to safeguard a harmonious balance between academia and industry in the realm of AI research.

AB  - One could think that bibliometric measurement of academic performance has always been digital since the computer-assisted invention of the Science Citation Index. Yet, since the 2000s, the digitization of bibliometric infrastructure has accelerated at a rapid pace. Citation databases are indexing an increasing variety of publication types. Altmetric data aggregators are producing data on the reception of research outcomes. Machine-readable persistent identifiers are created to unambiguously identify researchers, research organizations, and research objects; and evaluative software tools and current research information systems are constantly enlarging their functionalities to make use of these data and extract meaning from them. In this article, we analyse how these developments in evaluative bibliometrics have contributed to an extension of indicator-based research evaluation towards data-driven research analytics. Drawing on empirical material from blogs and websites as well as from research and policy papers, we discuss how interoperability, scalability, and flexibility as material specificities of digital infrastructures generate new ways of data production and their assessment, which affect the possibilities of how academic performance can be understood and (e)valuated.

AB  - Abstract Editormetrics analyses the role of editors of academic journals and their impact on the scientific publication system. Such analyses would best rely on open, structured, and machine-readable data about editors and editorial boards, which still remains rare. To address this shortcoming, the project Open Editors collects data about academic journal editors on a large scale and structures them into a single dataset. It does so by scraping the websites of 7,352 journals from 26 publishers (including predatory ones), thereby structuring publicly available information (names, affiliations, editorial roles, ORCID etc.) about 594,580 researchers. The dataset shows that journals and publishers are immensely heterogeneous in terms of editorial board sizes, regional diversity, and editorial role labels. All codes and data are made available at Zenodo, while the result is browsable at a dedicated website (https://openeditors.ooir.org). This dataset carries implications for both practical purposes of research evaluation and for meta-scientific investigations into the landscape of scholarly publications, and allows for critical inquiries regarding the representation of diversity and inclusivity across academia.

AB  - Abstract Advising and mentoring Ph.D. students is an increasingly important aspect of the academic profession. We define and interpret a family of metrics (collectively referred to as “ a -indices”) that can potentially be applied to “ranking academic advisors” using the academic genealogical records of scientists, with the emphasis on taking into account not only the number of students advised by an individual, but also subsequent academic advising records of those students. We also define and calculate the extensions of the proposed indices that account for student co-advising (referred to as “adjusted a -indices”). In addition, we extend some of the proposed metrics to ranking universities and countries with respect to their “collective” advising impacts, as well as track the evolution of these metrics over the past several decades. To illustrate the proposed metrics, we consider the social network of over 200,000 mathematicians (as of July 2018) constructed using the Mathematics Genealogy Project data.

AB  - Multi-label text classification (MLTC) involves tagging a document with its most relevant subset of labels from a label set. In real applications, labels usually follow a long-tailed distribution, where most labels (called as tail-label) only contain a small number of documents and limit the performance of MLTC. To facilitate this low-resource problem, researchers introduced a simple but effective strategy, data augmentation (DA). However, most existing DA approaches struggle in multi-label settings. The main reason is that the augmented documents for one label may inevitably influence the other co-occurring labels and further exaggerate the long-tailed problem. To mitigate this issue, we propose a new pair-level augmentation framework for MLTC, called Label-Specific Feature Augmentation (LSFA), which merely augments positive feature-label pairs for the tail-labels. LSFA contains two main parts. The first is for label-specific document representation learning in the high-level latent space, the second is for augmenting tail-label features in latent space by transferring the documents second-order statistics (intra-class semantic variations) from head labels to tail labels. At last, we design a new loss function for adjusting classifiers based on augmented datasets. The whole learning procedure can be effectively trained. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets have shown that the proposed LSFA outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts.

AB  - A well-established agenda on the research output, impact, and structure of global scientific elites such as Nobel Prize laureates has generated interest in the scientific elites from developing countries. However, this topic has not been investigated in detail. This study, first, deploys science mapping techniques to provide a comprehensive analysis of the output, impact, and structure of the Colombian scientific elite, i.e., researchers awarded with the Alejandro Ángel Escobar Foundation National Prize 1990-2020, known locally as the Colombian Nobel. Second, we conducted a productivity and impact comparison between the Colombian scientific elite and Nobel Prize laureates in science and economics by means of a stratified random sample 1990-2020 via the composite citation indicator proposed by Ioannidis et al. Findings showed that the Colombian scientific elite has a broader agenda than indexing titles in internationally renowned bibliographic databases. The Colombian scientific elite also showed positive growth, which is an inverse trend compared with the sample of Nobel laureate productivity. There were no noticeable changes in productivity/impact before and after receiving the Alejandro Ángel Escobar Foundation National Prize. Institutional collaboration within the Colombian scientific elite displayed the highest betweenness (brokerage) role of world/local top-tier universities. However, only two Colombian scientific elite members published an article with two Nobel Prize laureates. Most of the research profiles reflected the national output priorities, but were found to diverge from the national focus in respect of strategic research capacities. The interleaving of the Colombian scientific elite and Nobel Prize laureates-particularly between the 3rd and 2nd quartiles-enabled a more nuanced analysis of the local impact in the global scientific landscape. Our findings also contrast with previous findings on the lower research impact of authors from Latin America, despite their involvement as contributors to reputable journals, and also shed light on the research performance-impact standards and agenda between the global North and South and provide an in-context assessment of outstanding local research.

AB  - Multi-Label Few-Shot Aspect Category Detection (FS-ACD) is a new sub-task of aspect-based sentiment analysis, which aims to detect aspect categories accurately with limited training instances. Recently, dominant works use the prototypical network to accomplish this task, and employ the attention mechanism to extract keywords of aspect category from the sentences to produce the prototype for each aspect. However, they still suffer from serious noise problems: (1) due to lack of sufficient supervised data, the previous methods easily catch noisy words irrelevant to the current aspect category, which largely affects the quality of the generated prototype; (2) the semantically-close aspect categories usually generate similar prototypes, which are mutually noisy and confuse the classifier seriously. In this paper, we resort to the label information of each aspect to tackle the above problems, along with proposing a novel Label-Driven Denoising Framework (LDF). Extensive experimental results show that our framework achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Simulation experiments are typically conducted repeatedly during the model development process, for example, to revalidate if a behavioral property still holds after several model changes. Approaches for automatically reusing and generating simulation experiments can support modelers in conducting simulation studies in a more systematic and effective manner. They rely on explicit experiment specifications and, so far, on user interaction for initiating the reuse. Thereby, they are constrained to support the reuse of simulation experiments in a specific setting. Our approach now goes one step further by automatically identifying and adapting the experiments to be reused for a variety of scenarios. To achieve this, we exploit provenance graphs of simulation studies, which provide valuable information about the previous modeling and experimenting activities, and contain meta-information about the different entities that were used or produced during the simulation study. We define provenance patterns and associate them with a semantics, which allows us to interpret the different activities and construct transformation rules for provenance graphs. Our approach is implemented in a Reuse and Adapt framework for Simulation Experiments (RASE), which can interface with various modeling and simulation tools. In the case studies, we demonstrate the utility of our framework for (1) the repeated sensitivity analysis of an agent-based model of migration routes and (2) the cross-validation of two models of a cell signaling pathway.

AB  - According to smoothness assumption, local topological structure can be shared between feature and label manifolds.This study proposes a new algorithm based on Local Tangent Space Alignment (LTSA) to implement the label enhancement process.In general, we first establish a learning model for feature extraction in label space and use a feature extraction method of LTSA to guide the reconstruction of label manifolds.Then, we establish an unconstrained optimization model based on the optimal theory presented in this paper.The model is suitable for solving problems with a large number of sample points.Finally, the experiment results show that the algorithm can effectively improve the training speed and multilabel dataset prediction accuracy.

AB  - The DARE platform enables researchers and their developers to exploit more capabilities to handle complexity and scale in data, computation and collaboration.Today's challenges pose increasing and urgent demands for this combination of capabilities.To meet technical, economic and governance constraints, application communities must use use shared digital infrastructure principally via virtualisation and mapping.This requires precise abstractions that retain their meaning while their implementations and infrastructures change.Giving specialists direct control over these capabilities with detail relevant to each discipline is necessary for adoption.Research agility, improved power and retained return on intellectual investment incentivise that adoption.We report on an architecture for establishing and sustaining the necessary optimised mappings and early evaluations of its feasibility with two application communities.

AB  - Altmetrics promise useful support for assessing the impact of scientific works, including beyond the scholarly community and with very limited citation windows. Unfortunately, altmetrics scores are currently available only for recent articles and cannot be used as covariates in predicting long term impact of publications. However, the study of their statistical properties is a subject of evident interest to scientometricians. Applying the same approaches used in the literature to assess the universality of citation distributions, the intention here is to test whether the universal distribution also holds for Mendeley readerships. Results of the analysis carried out on a sample of publications randomly extracted from the Web of Science confirm that readerships seem to share similar shapes across fields and can be rescaled to a common and universal form. Such rescaling results as not particularly effective on the right tails. In other regions, rescaling causes a good collapse of field specific distributions, even for very recent publications.

AB  - The creative process is essentially Darwinian and only a small proportion of creative ideas are selected for further development. However, the threshold that identifies this small fraction of successfully disseminated creative ideas at their early stage has not been thoroughly analyzed through the lens of Rogers’s innovation diffusion theory. Here, we take highly cited (top 1%) research papers as an example of the most successfully disseminated creative ideas and explore the time it takes and citations it receives at their “take-off” stage, which play a crucial role in the dissemination of creativity. Results show the majority of highly cited papers will reach 10% and 25% of their total citations within 2 years and 4 years, respectively. Interestingly, our results also present a minimal number of articles that attract their first citation before publication. As for the discipline, number of references, and Price index, we find a significant difference exists: Clinical, Pre-Clinical & Health and Life Sciences are the first two disciplines to reach the C10% and C25% in a shorter amount of time. Highly cited papers with limited references usually take more time to reach 10% and 25% of their total citations. In addition, highly cited papers will attract citations rapidly when they cite more recent references. These results provide insights into the timespan and citations for a research paper to become highly cited at the “take-off” stage in its diffusion process, as well as the factors that may influence it.

AB  - Scientific digital libraries speed dissemination of scientific publications, but also the propagation of invalid or unreliable knowledge. Although many papers with known validity problems are highly cited, no auditing process is currently available to determine whether a citing paper's findings fundamentally depend on invalid or unreliable knowledge. To address this, we introduce a new framework, the keystone framework, designed to identify when and how citing unreliable findings impacts a paper, using argumentation theory and citation context analysis. Through two pilot case studies, we demonstrate how the keystone framework can be applied to knowledge maintenance tasks for digital libraries, including addressing citations of a non-reproducible paper and identifying statements most needing validation in a high-impact paper. We identify roles for librarians, database maintainers, knowledgebase curators, and research software engineers in applying the framework to scientific digital libraries.

AB  - As an important machine learning task, multi-label learning deals with the problem where each sample instance (feature vector) is associated with multiple labels simultaneously. Most existing approaches focus on manipulating the label space, such as exploiting correlations between labels and reducing label space dimension, with identical feature space in the process of classification. One potential drawback of this traditional strategy is that each label might have its own specific characteristics and using identical features for all label cannot lead to optimized performance. In this article, we propose an effective algorithm named LSDM, i.e., leveraging label-specific discriminant mapping features for multi-label learning , to overcome the drawback. LSDM sets diverse ratio parameter values to conduct cluster analysis on the positive and negative instances of identical label. It reconstructs label-specific feature space which includes distance information and spatial topology information. Our experimental results show that combining these two parts of information in the new feature representation can better exploit the clustering results in the learning process. Due to the problem of diverse combinations for identical label, we employ simplified linear discriminant analysis to efficiently excavate optimal one for each label and perform classification by querying the corresponding results. Comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms on a total of 20 benchmark datasets clearly manifests the competitiveness of LSDM.

AB  - The development of the Internet has increased the need for daily online information storage. Finding the correct information that we are interested in takes a lot of time, so the use of techniques for organizing and processing text data are needed. These techniques are called text classification or text categorization. There are many methods of text classification, but for this paper we study and apply the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method and compare its effect with the Naïve Bayes probability method. In addition, before implementing text classification, we performed preprocessing steps on the training set by extracting keywords with dimensional reduction techniques to reduce the time needed in the classification process.

In this paper, we proposed to combine the results of text and image data classifiers to get an accurate representation of the web pages. To get and analyse the data we created the complicated classifier system with data miner, text classifier, and aggregator. The process of image and text data classification has been achieved by the deep learning models. In order to represent the common view onto the web pages, we proposed three aggregation techniques that combine the data from the classifiers.

AB  - Text classification is essential for organizing unstructured text. Traditional methods rely on human annotations or, more recently, a set of class seed words for supervision, which can be costly, particularly for specialized or emerging domains. To address this, using class surface names alone as extremely weak supervision has been proposed. However, existing approaches treat different levels of text granularity (documents, sentences, or words) independently, disregarding inter-granularity class disagreements and the context identifiable exclusively through joint extraction. In order to tackle these issues, we introduce MEGClass, an extremely weakly-supervised text classification method that leverages Mutually-Enhancing Text Granularities. MEGClass utilizes coarse- and fine-grained context signals obtained by jointly considering a document's most class-indicative words and sentences. This approach enables the learning of a contextualized document representation that captures the most discriminative class indicators. By preserving the heterogeneity of potential classes, MEGClass can select the most informative class-indicative documents as iterative feedback to enhance the initial word-based class representations and ultimately fine-tune a pre-trained text classifier. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that MEGClass outperforms other weakly and extremely weakly supervised methods.

AB  - Journal articles have been the gold standard for research and scholarly communication. Specifically, measurements of publication and citation, particularly in high-impact journals, have long been the key means of accruing credit for researchers. In turn, these credits become the currency through which researchers acquire funding and achieve professional success. But, like global trade, tying in to a fixed standard limits wealth distribution and innovation. It is time for the research community to attribute credit for contributions that reflect and drive collaborative innovation, rewarding behaviors that produce better research outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Semi-supervised text classification-based paradigms (SSTC) typically employ the spirit of self-training. The key idea is to train a deep classifier on limited labeled texts and then iteratively predict the unlabeled texts as their pseudo-labels for further training. However, the performance is largely affected by the accuracy of pseudo-labels, which may not be significant in real-world scenarios. This paper presents a Rank-aware Negative Training (RNT) framework to address SSTC in learning with noisy label settings. To alleviate the noisy information, we adapt a reasoning with uncertainty-based approach to rank the unlabeled texts based on the evidential support received from the labeled texts. Moreover, we propose the use of negative training to train RNT based on the concept that “the input instance does not belong to the complementary label”. A complementary label is randomly selected from all labels except the label on-target. Intuitively, the probability of a true label serving as a complementary label is low and thus provides less noisy information during the training, resulting in better performance on the test data. Finally, we evaluate the proposed solution on various text classification benchmark datasets. Our extensive experiments show that it consistently overcomes the state-of-the-art alternatives in most scenarios and achieves competitive performance in the others. The code of RNT is publicly available on GitHub.

AB  - Multi-view, Multi-instance, and Multi-label Learning (M3L) can model complex objects (bags), which are represented with different feature views, made of diverse instances, and annotated with discrete non-exclusive labels. Existing M3L approaches assume a complete correspondence between bags and views, and also assume a complete annotation for training. However, in practice, neither the correspondence between bags, nor the bags' annotations are complete. To tackle such a weakly-supervised M3L task, a solution called WSM3L is introduced. WSM3L adapts multimodal dictionary learning to learn a shared dictionary (representational space) across views and individual encoding vectors of bags for each view. The label similarity and feature similarity of encoded bags are jointly used to match bags across views. In addition, it replenishes the annotations of a bag based on the annotations of its neighborhood bags, and introduces a dispatch and aggregation term to dispatch bag-level annotations to instances and to reversely aggregate instance-level annotations to bags. WSM3L unifies these objectives and processes in a joint objective function to predict the instance-level and bag-level annotations in a coordinated fashion, and it further introduces an alternative solution for the objective function optimization. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of WSM3L on benchmark datasets.

AB  - Multi-label classification aims to deal with the problem that an object may be associated with one or more labels, which is a more difficult task due to the complex nature of multi-label data.The crucial problem of multi-label classification is the more robust and higher-level feature representation learning, which can reduce non-helpful feature attributes from the input space prior to training.In recent years, deep learning methods based on autoencoders have achieved excellent performance in multi-label classification for the advantages of powerful representations learning ability and fast convergence speed.However, most existing autoencoder-based methods only rely on the single autoencoder model, which pose challenges for multi-label feature representations learning and fail to measure similarities between data spaces.To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel representation learning method with dual autoencoder for multi-label classification.Compared to the existing autoencoder-based methods, our proposed method can capture different characteristics and more abstract features from data by the serially connection of two different types of autoencoders.More specifically, firstly, the algorithm of Reconstruction Independent Component Analysis (RICA) in sparse autoencoder is trained on patches on all training and test dataset for robust global feature representations learning.Secondly, with the output of RICA, stacked autoencoder with manifold regularization (SAMR) is introduced to ameliorate the quality of multi-label features learning.Comprehensive experiments on several real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared with several competing state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Constructing a novel bioinformatic workflow by reusing and repurposing fragments crossing workflows is regarded as an error-avoiding and effort-saving strategy. Traditional techniques have been proposed to discover scientific workflow fragments leveraging their profiles and historical usages of their activities (or services). However, social relations of workflows, including relations between services and their developers have not been explored extensively. In fact, current techniques describe invoking relations between services, mostly, and they can hardly reveal implicit relations between services. To address this challenge, we propose a social-aware scientific workflow knowledge graph (S2KG) to capture common types of entities and various types of relations by analyzing relevant information about bioinformatic workflows and their developers recorded in repositories. Using attributes of entities such as credit and creation time, the union impact of several positive and negative links in S2KG is identified, to evaluate the feasibility of workflow fragment construction. To facilitate the discovery of single services, a service invoking network is extracted form S2KG, and service communities are constructed accordingly. A bioinformatic workflow fragment discovery mechanism based on Yen's method is developed to discover appropriate fragments with respect to certain user's requirements. Extensive experiments are conducted, where bioinformatic workflows publicly accessible at the myExperiment repository are adopted. Evaluation results show that our technique performs better than the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of the precision, recall, and F1.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this paper is to provide a review of the literature on the original disruption index (DI 1 ) and its variants in scientometrics. The DI 1 has received much media attention and prompted a public debate about science policy implications, since a study published in Nature found that papers in all disciplines and patents are becoming less disruptive over time. This review explains in the first part the DI 1 and its variants in detail by examining their technical and theoretical properties. The remaining parts of the review are devoted to studies that examine the validity and the limitations of the indices. Particular focus is placed on (1) possible biases that affect disruption indices (2) the convergent and predictive validity of disruption scores, and (3) the comparative performance of the DI 1 and its variants. The review shows that, while the literature on convergent validity is not entirely conclusive, it is clear that some modified index variants, in particular DI 5 , show higher degrees of convergent validity than DI 1 . The literature draws attention to the fact that (some) disruption indices suffer from inconsistency, time-sensitive biases, and several data-induced biases. The limitations of disruption indices are highlighted and best practice guidelines are provided. The review encourages users of the index to inform about the variety of DI 1 variants and to apply the most appropriate variant. More research on the validity of disruption scores as well as a more precise understanding of disruption as a theoretical construct is needed before the indices can be used in the research evaluation practice.

AB  - Web pages are heterogeneous and complex and there exists complicated associations within one web pages and linking to the others. The high interactions between terms in pages demonstrate vague and ambiguous meanings. Efficient and effective clustering methods are needed to discover latent and coherent meanings in context are necessary. This paper proposes an efficient clustering approach for fair semantic web content retrieval based on tri-level ontology construction model with hybrid dragonfly algorithm. Initially the query processing phase, by making use of systematic adaptive hierarchy method (SAHM) efficient ontology selection process is carried out by means of matching keywords retrieved form user query. Secondly, fuzzy sensitive near-neighbour influence (FSNI) based clustering approach relied on the ontology driven fuzzy linguistic measure, applied to estimate the uncertainty that may be relevant to the semantic content which belongs to the user quires. The proposed FSNI clustering approach with HDA algorithm performance is be evaluated and compared with existing clustering approaches in terms of retrieval accuracy and surfing time.

AB  - In this paper, we propose three ensemble-based feature ranking scores for multi-label classification (MLC), which is a generalisation of multi-class classification where the classes are not mutually exclusive. Each of the scores (Symbolic, Genie3 and Random forest) can be computed from three different ensembles of predictive clustering trees: Bagging, Random forest and Extra trees. We extensively evaluate the proposed scores on 24 benchmark MLC problems, using 15 standard MLC evaluation measures. We determine the ranking quality saturation points in terms of the ensemble sizes, for each ranking-ensemble pair, and show that quality rankings can be computed really efficiently (typically 10 or 50 trees suffice). We also show that the proposed feature rankings are relevant and determine the most appropriate ensemble method for every feature ranking score. We empirically prove that the proposed feature ranking scores outperform current state-of-the-art methods in the quality of the rankings (for the majority of the evaluation measures), and in time efficiency. Finally, we determine the best performing feature ranking scores. Taking into account the quality of the rankings first and—in the case of ties—time efficiency, we identify the Genie3 feature ranking score as the optimal one.

AB  - Transmit and process information to establish a learning mechanism and realize the processing of image data and sound data. However, the current research on Web page classification algorithm (WPCA) based on deep learning (DL) is not in-depth. Therefore, the main research of this article is the research of WPCA based on DL. This article first uses the keyword weight calculation method to reduce the impact of a small number of high-frequency words in the web page document on the weight calculation and reduces the value of the low-frequency word weights so that the WPCA is more accurate in the calculation process; second, the use of Chinese web pages: the classification method calculates the similarity between the text to be classified and all the class templates and then determines the category of all texts according to the similarity and certain classification rules; finally, in order to improve the learning rate of DL, consider using adaptive parameters. The optimization algorithm automatically adjusts the size of the learning rate, making the research of WPCA based on DL more efficient. After comparing the DL-based WPCA with the traditional algorithm, the data shows that in terms of time expenditure, the DL WPCA is 354 s, the traditional algorithm is 2436 s; in terms of memory overhead, the DL WPCA is 6.35 s, the traditional algorithm is 186.25 s. The experimental results show that WPCA based on DL are faster and more efficient than traditional algorithms and consume less system memory.

AB  - In this study, I developed operational versions of Gini’s and Hirsch’s indexes that can be applied to characterize each researcher’s publication history (PH) as heterodox, orthodox, and interdisciplinary. In addition, the new indicators warn against anomalies that potentially arise from tactical or opportunistic citation and publication behaviors by authors and editors, and can be calculated from readily available information. I split the original Hirsch index into nested indexes to isolate networking activity, as well as to distinguish scientific production (number of articles) from scientific productivity (rate of production), and used nested Gini indexes to identify intentional and successful intertopical and interdisciplinary research. I applied the most popular standardizations (i.e., per author and per year), and used simple methodologies (i.e., least-squares linear and cubic fitting, whole-career vs. subperiods, two-dimensional graphs). I provide three representative numerical examples based on an orthodox multidisciplinary PH, a heterodox PH from the social sciences, and an orthodox unidisciplinary PH from the physical sciences. Two additional numerical examples based on PHs from the life and health sciences show that the suggested PH characterization can be applied to different disciplines where different publication and citation practices prevail. Software is provided to help readers explore the use of these indicators.

AB  - Abstract The following article aims to understand the prevalence of ascribed social characteristics such as the role of gender and the country of institutional affiliation of the authors in two prominent journals of social network science. Accordingly, we explore the Social Networks journal that has been extensively analysed to understand the evolution of the social network perspective and the development of this area of interest. Also, we explore the REDES journal, which mirrors the same journal but aims to represent the current state of social network science in Iberian America. For the analysis, we explore the network of these two journals, considering 301 papers from the Social Networks journal and 86 papers from REDES journal. For the analysis, we use exponential random graph models to control for simultaneously operating micro-mechanisms to understand the potential effects that allowed the emergence of these scientific networks. Our main results indicate that the country of institutional affiliation creates a centre-periphery tendency in both journals. Furthermore, there is a tendency of women to be an underrepresented group in the papers published in the period analysed.

AB  - In China, the application of corpus in language teaching, especially in English and American literature teaching, is still in the preliminary research stage, and there are various shortcomings, which have not been paid due attention by front-line educators. Constructing English and American literature corpus according to certain principles can effectively promote English and American literature teaching. The research of this paper is devoted to how to automatically build a corpus of English and American literature. In the process of keyword extraction, key phrases and keywords are effectively combined. The similarity between atomic events is calculated by the TextRank algorithm, and then the first N sentences with high similarity are selected and sorted. Based on ML (machine learning) text classification method, a combined classifier based on SVM (support vector machine) and NB (Naive Bayes) is proposed. The experimental results show that, from the point of view of accuracy and recall, the classification effect of the combined algorithm proposed in this paper is the best among the three methods. The best classification results of accuracy, recall, and F value are 0.87, 0.9, and 0.89, respectively. Experimental results show that this method can quickly, accurately, and persistently obtain high-quality bilingual mixed web pages.

AB  - Digital data is a basic form of research product for which citation, and the generation of credit or recognition for authors, are still not well understood. The notion of data credit has therefore recently emerged as a new measure, defined and based on data citation groundwork. Data credit is a real value representing the importance of data cited by a research entity. We can use credit to annotate data contained in a curated scientific database and then as a proxy of the significance and impact of that data in the research world. It is a method that, together with citations, helps recognize the value of data and its creators. In this paper, we explore the problem of Data Credit Distribution, the process by which credit is distributed to the database parts responsible for producing data being cited by a research entity. We adopt as use case the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (GtoPdb), a widely-used curated scientific relational database. We focus on Select-Project-Join (SPJ) queries under bag semantics, and we define three distribution strategies based on how-provenance, responsibility, and the Shapley value. Using these distribution strategies, we show how credit can highlight frequently used database areas and how it can be used as a new bibliometric measure for data and their curators. In particular, credit rewards data and authors based on their research impact, not only on the citation count. We also show how these distribution strategies vary in their sensitivity to the role of an input tuple in the generation of the output data and reward input tuples differently.

AB  - Abstract This article describes a teaching strategy that synergizes computing and management, aimed at the running of complex projects in industry and academia, in the areas of civil engineering, physics, geosciences, and a number of other related fields. The course derived from this strategy includes four parts: (a) Computing with a selected set of modern paradigms—the stress is on Control Flow and Data Flow computing paradigms, but paradigms conditionally referred to as Energy Flow and Diffusion Flow are also covered; (b) Project management that is holistic—the stress is on the wide plethora of issues spanning from the preparation of project proposals, all the way to incorporation activities to follow after the completion of a successful project; (c) Examples from past research and development experiences—the stress is on experiences of leading experts from academia and industry; (d) Student projects that stimulate creativity—the stress is on methods that educators could use to induce and accelerate the creativity of students in general. Finally, the article ends with selected pearls of wisdom that could be treated as suggestions for further elaboration.

AB  - Mining user-generated content on e-commerce platforms and social media is timely and more objective compared with other information access channels for gaining competitive intelligence. Identifying comparative text from large volumes of non-comparative text is an important but challenging task. On one hand, existing methods are time-consuming and not generalizable across different domains. On the other hand, the datasets for the task generally suffer from the severe imbalance issue. To address abovementioned problems, we propose a framework adopting advanced deep learning methods to automatically learn features and a novel textual data augmentation method named TA3S to deal with the data imbalance issue. Specifically, the TA3S method simultaneously considers the syntactic structure and semantic information of comparative text samples. Moreover, in order to support the successful implementation of TA3S, we develop a novel method based on word embedding and label propagation algorithm to distinguish between synonymous and antonymous substitute words. The experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our framework, and present that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying comparative text from user-generated content.

AB  - Abstract Citation indexes are by now part of the research infrastructure in use by most scientists: a necessary tool in order to cope with the increasing amounts of scientific literature being published. Commercial citation indexes are designed for the sciences and have uneven coverage and unsatisfactory characteristics for humanities scholars, while no comprehensive citation index is published by a public organisation. We argue that an open citation index for the humanities is desirable, for four reasons: it would greatly improve and accelerate the retrieval of sources, it would offer a way to interlink collections across repositories (such as archives and libraries), it would foster the adoption of metadata standards and best practices by all stakeholders (including publishers) and it would contribute research data to fields such as bibliometrics and science studies. We also suggest that the citation index should be informed by a set of requirements relevant to the humanities. We discuss four such requirements: source coverage must be comprehensive, including books and citations to primary sources; there needs to be chronological depth, as scholarship in the humanities remains relevant over time; the index should be collection driven, leveraging the accumulated thematic collections of specialised research libraries; and it should be rich in context in order to allow for the qualification of each citation, for example, by providing citation excerpts. We detail the fit-for-purpose research infrastructure which can make the Humanities Citation Index a reality. Ultimately, we argue that a citation index for the humanities can be created by humanists, via a collaborative, distributed and open effort.

AB  - The very nature of scientific inquiry encourages the flow of ideas across research domains in a discipline. Research topics with higher inter-domain presence tend to attract higher attention at individual and organizational levels. This is more pronounced in a discipline like computing, with its deeply intertwined ideas and strong connections with technology. In this paper, we study corpora of research publications across four domains of the computing discipline - covering more than 150,000 papers, involving more than 200,000 authors over 55 years and 175 publication venues - to examine the influences on inter-domain presence of research topics. We find statistically significant evidence that higher collective eminence of researchers publishing on a topic is related to lower inter-domain presence of that topic, fewer authors publishing on a topic relate to the topic being likely to have higher inter-domain presence, while topics belonging to more close-knit clusters of topics are likely to have lower inter-domain presence. Our results can inform decisions around defining and sustaining research agendas and offer insights on the progression of the computing discipline.

AB  - The research aim is to determine the effect of word-stemming in web pages classification using different machine learning classifiers, namely Naïve Bayes (NB), k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MP). Each classifiers' performance is evaluated in term of accuracy and processing time. This research uses BBC dataset that has five predefined categories. The result demonstrates that classifiers' performance is better without word stemming, whereby all classifiers show higher classification accuracy, with the highest accuracy produced by NB and SVM at 97% for F1 score, while NB takes shorter training time than SVM. With word stemming, the effect on training and classification time is negligible, except on Multilayer Perceptron in which word stemming has effectively reduced the training time.

AB  - Abstract There has been increasing interest in the study of research communities with the goal of optimizing their outcomes and impact. While current methods can predict future trends, they offer little insight about the causes of the trends. However, causal insight is important for strategic decision making to improve a community. This paper presents a new method to predict the possible causes for inefficiencies in a community by relating them to disconnections between trends, like trends in the number of publications, patents, citations, and so on. The method combines traditional scientometric and webometric metrics and metric predictions with a recent model for trend analysis in a community. The proposed method was used to analyze electronic design automation (EDA) domain. The analysis showed intriguing disconnections between the trends of the number of papers, number of granted patents, and impact of its main publications. The analysis suggests a slightly decreasing impact and visibility of EDA, while having less novel, commonly-accepted knowledge in the area. The gained insight suggests three possible strategic decisions to improve EDA community: avoiding to ignore new ideas, reducing the complexity of framed problems, and keeping a minimal gap between real-life needs and academic solutions.

AB  - Abstract Altmetrics are web‐based quantitative impact or attention indicators for academic articles that have been proposed to supplement citation counts. This article reports the first assessment of the extent to which mature altmetrics from Altmetric.com and Mendeley associate with individual article quality scores. It exploits expert norm‐referenced peer review scores from the UK Research Excellence Framework 2021 for 67,030+ journal articles in all fields 2014–2017/2018, split into 34 broadly field‐based Units of Assessment (UoAs). Altmetrics correlated more strongly with research quality than previously found, although less strongly than raw and field normalized Scopus citation counts. Surprisingly, field normalizing citation counts can reduce their strength as a quality indicator for articles in a single field. For most UoAs, Mendeley reader counts are the best altmetric (e.g., three Spearman correlations with quality scores above 0.5), tweet counts are also a moderate strength indicator in eight UoAs (Spearman correlations with quality scores above 0.3), ahead of news (eight correlations above 0.3, but generally weaker), blogs (five correlations above 0.3), and Facebook (three correlations above 0.3) citations, at least in the United Kingdom. In general, altmetrics are the strongest indicators of research quality in the health and physical sciences and weakest in the arts and humanities.

AB  - The need to demonstrate the impact of research has become an important issue in the Higher Education sector in the UK. This has been taken care of through the introduction of ‘impact case studies’ as part of the research excellence framework (REF). The aim of the study presented in this paper was to understand the role that educational technology (and related terms) played in the 2014 REF impact case studies, using the public online database of case studies as a data source. Searches for 11 educational technology-related terms yielded a sample of 125 unique case studies. Although this represents only 1.9% of the total case studies, educational technology is clearly playing a role. The cases comprised two major subgroups: those where educational technology was the focus of the research (mainly associated with cases in education and computer science), and those where educational technology was used as a route to achieving impact (mainly in health-related subjects). The findings have implications for the contributions that educational technology and educational technologists can make in enhancing and supporting this important issue within their institutions.

AB  - Text Classification (TC) is a fundamental task in the information retrieval community. Nowadays, the mainstay TC methods are built on the deep neural networks, which can learn much more discriminative text features than the traditional shallow learning methods. Among existing deep TC methods, the ones based on Graph Neural Network (GNN) have attracted more attention due to the superior performance. Technically, the GNN-based TC methods mainly transform the full training dataset to a graph of texts; however, they often neglect the dependency between words, so as to miss potential semantic information of texts, which may be significant to exactly represent them. To solve the aforementioned problem, we generate graphs of words instead, so as to capture the dependency information of words. Specifically, each text is translated into a graph of words, where neighboring words are linked. We learn the node features of words by a GNN-like procedure and then aggregate them as the graph feature to represent the current text. To further improve the text representations, we suggest a contrastive learning regularization term. Specifically, we generate two augmented text graphs for each original text graph, we constrain the representations of the two augmented graphs from the same text close and the ones from different texts far away. We propose various techniques to generate the augmented graphs. Upon those ideas, we develop a novel deep TC model, namely Text-level Graph Networks with Contrastive Learning (TGN cl ). We conduct a number of experiments to evaluate the proposed TGN cl model. The empirical results demonstrate that TGN cl can outperform the existing state-of-the-art TC models.

AB  - Due to the mass availability of textual data on Web, text classification (TC), classifying texts into predetermined sets becomes a spotlight for researchers. A number of TC applications have been proposed yet very few studies reported an overview of TC research area in a proper and systematic manner. This paper aims to provide an overview of TC research trends and gaps by structuring and analyzing research patterns, encountered problems and problem-solving methods in TC. In other words, this study highlights problem types, data sources, choice of language of text and types of applied techniques in TC. An intensive systematic study is conducted by applying guidelines proposed by Petersen and colleagues in 2007. In this paper, ninety-six literatures from five electronic databases from 2006 to 2017 were systematically reviewed and followed each and every step properly in accordance with systematic mapping study. Nine main problems in TC research area were identified and significant findings which highlighted the evolution of TC research within the past 12 years were investigated. Different from other review articles, this paper highlighted issues and technical gaps of TC area in a useful and effective manner.

With the new release, a completely revised tool has been published. It is not only based on citation data (bibliometrics), but also Mendeley data (altmetrics). Thus, the institutional impact measurement of the tool has been expanded by focusing on additional status groups besides researchers such as students and librarians. Furthermore, the visualization of the data has been completely updated by improving the operability for the user and including new features such as institutional profile pages. In this paper, we describe the datasets for the current excellencemapping.net tool and the indicators applied. Furthermore, the underlying statistics for the tool and the use of the web application are explained.

AB  - Considerable scientific work involves locating, analyzing, systematizing, and synthesizing other publications, often with the help of online scientific publication databases and search engines. However, use of online sources suffers from a lack of repeatability and transparency, as well as from technical restrictions. Alexandria3k is a Python software package and an associated command-line tool that can populate embedded relational databases with slices from the complete set of several open publication metadata sets. These can then be employed for reproducible processing and analysis through versatile and performant queries. We demonstrate the software’s utility by visualizing the evolution of publications in diverse scientific fields and relationships among them, by outlining scientometric facts associated with COVID-19 research, and by replicating commonly-used bibliometric measures and findings regarding scientific productivity, impact, and disruption.

AB  - Abstract Multi-label learning is a machine learning subclass that aims to assign more than one label simultaneously for each instance. Many real-world tasks include high-dimensional data which reduces the performance of machine learning methods. To solve this issue, a filter and multi-label feature selection is proposed in this paper. The main idea of the proposed method is to choose highly relevant and non-redundant features with the lowest information loss. The proposed method first uses a novel graph-based density peaks clustering to group similar features to reach this goal. It then uses the ant colony optimization search process to rank features based on their relevancy to a set of labels and also their redundancy with the other features. A graph first represents the feature space, and then a novel density peaks clustering is used to group similar features. Then, the ants are searched through the graph to select a set of non-similar features by remaining in the clusters with a low probability and jumping among the clusters with a high probability. Moreover, in this paper, to evaluate the solutions found by the ants, a novel criterion based on mutual information was used to assign a high pheromone value to highly relevant and non-redundant features. Finally, the final features are chosen based on their pheromone values. The results of experiments on a set of real-world datasets show the superiority of the proposed method over a set of baseline and state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Abstract In this article, we study the international mobility of researchers in the field of computer science (CS). Our analysis hinges upon Scopus data spanning a time period of 30 years (1991–2020) and involves a total of 969,835 researchers and 8,412,543 publications. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we characterize mobility as a fairly common phenomenon in CS, we highlight a strong correlation with standard bibliometric indicators at all seniority levels and a lower propensity of female researchers to relocate internationally than their male colleagues. Second, we analyze individual career paths building from them a mobility graph and identifying common patterns, such as the most traveled connections between different countries, whether they are equally traversed in both directions and the most frequently visited countries. The temporal evolution of the above patterns within our 30-year time frame is also investigated. The United States emerged as a preferred destination for internationally mobile authors, with strong connections to China (from the early 2000s), Canada, and several prominent European countries, most notably the United Kingdom, Germany, and France.

AB  - Science is an international effort, receiving contributions from researchers across the globe. The capacity of a country or a region to generate and publish quality research varies greatly according to the location examined. Among the factors that dictate the quantity and quality of scientific research are the availability of infrastructure and human resources, the traditions related to research endeavors, and, most significantly, local governmental support for research. There are several conditions that both individually and cooperatively limit research activities in Latin America, such as insufficient governmental support, a paucity of material and technical resources, heavy teaching loads, the absence of peer networks, and multiple constraints on publication. This commentary has been developed to discuss each of the issues that permit and, more frequently, limit biological and agricultural research endeavors in Latin America.

AB  - In terms of the total number of speakers in the world Bengali stands as the seventh language and it has been used by approximately 265 million people worldwide. Day by day more people are expressing their views and opinions in Bengali in digital platforms like blogs and social media on various topics. Despite this, very little work has been done to structure these electronic documents according to their categories. In this paper, a methodology is developed for automatically categorizing Bengali news among twelve predefined categories using a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) model. We also explored the optimization opportunities that lie within the feature space and illustrated the difficulties that arise while handling large feature spaces in neural networks. It has been shown in this paper that the feature space can be optimized to achieve better accuracy. Using our modified feature extraction technique, we reduced the feature space and achieved an accuracy of 93.3%.

AB  - Abstract Science gateways have been widely utilized by a large number of user communities to simplify access to complex distributed computing infrastructures. While science gateways are still becoming increasingly popular and the number of user communities is growing, the fast and efficient creation of new science gateways and the flexibility to deploy these gateways on‐demand on heterogeneous computational resources, remain a challenge. Additionally, the increase in the number of users, especially with very different backgrounds, requires intuitive embedded e‐learning tools that support all stakeholders to find related learning material and to guide the learning process. This paper introduces a novel science gateway framework that addresses these challenges. The framework supports the creation, publication, selection, and deployment of cloud‐based reference architectures that can be automatically instantiated and executed even by nontechnical users. The framework also incorporates a knowledge repository exchange and learning module that provides embedded e‐learning support. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed solution, two scientific case studies are presented based on the requirements of the plasmasphere, ionosphere, and thermosphere research communities.

AB  - Service manual documents are crucial to the engineering company as they provide guidelines and knowledge to service engineers.However, it has become inconvenient and inefficient for service engineers to retrieve specific knowledge from documents due to the complexity of resources.In this research, we propose an automated knowledge mining and document classification system with novel multi-model transfer learning approaches.Particularly, the classification performance of the system has been improved with three effective techniques: fine-tuning, pruning, and multi-model method.The fine-tuning technique optimizes a pre-trained BERT model by adding a feed-forward neural network layer and the pruning technique is used to retrain the BERT model with new data.The multi-model method initializes and trains multiple BERT models to overcome the randomness of data ordering during the fine-tuning process.In the first iteration of the training process, multiple BERT models are being trained simultaneously.The best model is then selected for the next phase of the training process with another two iterations and the training processes for other BERT models will be terminated.The performance of the proposed system has been evaluated by comparing with two robust baseline methods, BERT and BERT-CNN.Experimental results on a widely used Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA) dataset have shown that the proposed techniques perform better than these baseline methods in terms of accuracy and MCC score.

AB  - Citations of scientific papers and patents reveal the knowledge flow and usually serve as the metric for evaluating their novelty and impacts in the field. Citation Forecasting thus has various applications in the real world. Existing works on citation forecasting typically exploit the sequential properties of citation events, without exploring the citation network. In this paper, we propose to explore both the citation network and the related citation event sequences which provide valuable information for future citation forecasting. We propose a novel \em Citation Network and Event Sequence (CINES) Model to encode signals in the citation network and related citation event sequences into various types of embeddings for decoding to the arrivals of future citations. Moreover, we propose atemporal network attention and three alternative designs of \em bidirectional feature propagation to aggregate the retrospective and prospective aspects of publications in the citation network, coupled with the citation event sequence embeddings learned by a \em two-level attention mechanism for the citation forecasting. We evaluate our models and baselines on both a U.S. patent dataset and a DBLP dataset. Experimental results show that our models outperform the state-of-the-art methods, i.e., RMTPP, CYAN-RNN, Intensity-RNN, and PC-RNN, reducing the forecasting error by 37.76% - 75.32%.

AB  - This study seeks insight into the social structure of Antarctic research from 1998 to 2015 by examining peer-reviewed journal articles listed in the Science Citation Index of the Web of Science database. This study identifies leading countries in peer-reviewed journal article output and applies social network analysis methods to identify countries where authors are collaborating with those affiliated with organizations in different countries. The results show that the number of publications on Antarctica and the proportion of international research collaboration increased from 23.0 to 33.2% during the period of time being considered. The number of articles published by authors affiliated with institutions in emerging countries such as China, Turkey, Brazil and South Korea rose, whereas the proportion of articles published by authors affiliated with institutions in the United States decreased. The largest proportion of academic publications pertaining to Antarctic research was within the natural sciences. Within this broad field, the majority of publications fell within Earth and related environmental sciences and the biological sciences. Social network analysis shows that Antarctic research moved towards a network, in which researchers are internationally more connected than ever before, with countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Australia in central positions. Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands did not account for a high percentage of academic contributions but were still notable for their multinational collaborative research.

AB  - The present study aimed to analyze and visualize the science map of Cochrane systematic reviews (CSRs) with high Altmetric attention score (AAS). On 2020-07-29, the altmetric data of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were obtained from the Altmetric database (Altmetric LLP, London, UK). Bibliometric data of the top 5% AAS of CSRs were extracted from the Web of Science. Keyword co-occurrence, co-authorship and co-citation network analyses were then employed using VOSviewer software. The random forest model was used to rank the importance of the altmetric resource. A total of 11222 CSRs with AAS were found (Total mentions: 305265), with Twitter being the most popular Altmetric resource. Consequently, the top 5% AAS (649 articles, mean AAS: 204.95, 95% confidence level: 18.95, mean citations: 123.68, 95% confidence level: 13.9) were included. Density mapping revealed female, adult and child as the most popular author keywords. According to network visualization, Helen V. Worthington (University of Manchester, Manchester, UK), the University of Oxford and UK had the greatest impact on the network at the author, organization and country levels respectively. AAS were weekly correlated with citations (rs=0.21) although citations were moderately correlated with policy document and blog mentions (rs=0.46 and rs=0.43). Cochrane systematic reviews received high levels of online attention, particularly in the Twittersphere and mostly from the UK. However, CSRs were rarely publicized and discussed using recently developed academic tools, such as F1000 prime, Publons and PubPeer.

AB  - Network-based document clustering involves forming clusters of documents based on their significance and relationship strength. This approach can be used with various types of metadata that express the significance of the documents and the relationships among them. In this study, we defined a probabilistic network graph for fine-grained document clustering and developed a probabilistic generative model and calculation method. Furthermore, a novel neural-network-based network embedding learning method was devised that considers the significance of a document based on its rankings with external measures, such as the download counts of relevant files, and reflects the relationship strength between the documents. By considering the significance of a document, reputative documents of clusters can be centralized and shown as representative documents for tasks such as data analysis and data representation. During evaluation tests, the proposed ranking-based network-embedding method performs significantly better on various algorithms, such as the k-means algorithm and common word/phrase-based clustering methods, than the existing network embedding approaches.

AB  - Abstract Policy document mentions are useful for assessing the societal impact of scholarly papers. However, how policy document mentions can be interpreted is unclear yet. In this study, content analysis was used to examine features (mentioned element, mentioning form, and mentioning location) and motivations of policy document mention to scholarly papers. 885 policy documents were sampled for analysis from the Altmetric.com database. Results reveal that: (1) The mentioned elements of policy document mentions can be divided as five categories, summarized content (26.9%) is the most frequent one. (2) We found five types of the mentioning form of policy document mentions, the major mentioning form is references (72.3%). (3) The mentioning locations in policy documents can be divided into twelve categories, expounding (47.4%) and review (22.6%) are the core mentioning locations. (4) Motivation of policy document mentions can be broken down into five major categories and seventeen minor categories, more than 30% of motivations are to support the policy argument by listing relevant work. Analysis of the mention features of the policy document mentions gives us another way to understand how it works and how policy document mentions are motivated, with these findings we can do more work to find out the relationship between scientific articles and policy documents.

AB  - Scientific conferences are essential for developing active research communities, promoting the cross-pollination of ideas and technologies, bridging between academia and industry, and disseminating new findings. Analyzing and monitoring scientific conferences is thus crucial for all users who need to take informed decisions in this space. However, scholarly search engines and bibliometric applications only provide a limited set of analytics for assessing research conferences, preventing us from performing a comprehensive analysis of these events. In this paper, we introduce the AIDA Dashboard, a novel web application, developed in collaboration with Springer Nature, for analyzing and comparing scientific conferences. This tool introduces three major new features: 1) it enables users to easily compare conferences within specific fields (e.g., Digital Libraries) and time-frames (e.g., the last five years); 2) it characterises conferences according to a 14K research topics from the Computer Science Ontology (CSO); and 3) it provides several functionalities for assessing the involvement of commercial organizations, including the ability to characterize industrial contributions according to 66 industrial sectors (e.g., automotive, financial, energy, electronics) from the Industrial Sectors Ontology (INDUSO). We evaluated the AIDA Dashboard by performing both a quantitative evaluation and a user study, obtaining excellent results in terms of quality of the analytics and usability.

AB  - First posted November 29, 2021 For additional information, contact: Director, U.S. Geological Survey 12201 Sunrise Valley DriveReston, VA 20192 Managers of our Nation’s resources face unprecedented challenges driven by the convergence of increasing, competing societal demands and a changing climate that affects the stability, vulnerability, and predictability of those resources. To help meet these challenges, the scientific community must take advantage of all available technologies, data, and integrative Earth systems modeling capacity to better inform resource and risk management decisions. This is the overarching goal of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Monitoring, Analysis, and Prediction (EarthMAP) vision: “By 2030, the USGS will deliver well integrated observations and predictions of the future state of natural systems—water, ecosystems, energy, minerals, hazards—at regional and national scales, working primarily with federal, state, and academic partners to develop and operate the capability” (U.S. Geological Survey, 2021).Providing more integrated Earth systems science and actionable information to decision makers, stakeholders, and the public requires a better understanding of the depth and distribution of existing capacity (capabilities, tools, and techniques) across the Bureau. Identifying existing capacity is also a critical first step toward gap analysis and targeted investments to increase capacity over time. The USGS formed a Capacity Assessment Team (CAT) and charged it with (1) conducting a Request for Information (RFI) to identify existing USGS expertise and activities supportive of integrated and predictive science to inform decision making, (2) developing a strategy and proof-of-concept for a continuously updated capacity assessment capability, and (3) identifying lessons learned to inform development of best practices for future capacity assessment efforts.The RFI took the form of a survey, with content guided by the science and technology needs identified in a USGS report titled “Grand Challenges for Integrated U.S. Geological Survey Science—A Workshop Report” (Jenni and others, 2017). The 44-question survey provided respondents the ability to rate their level of experience with a suite of priority disciplines, analysis and modeling approaches, technologies, and stakeholder engagement strategies and to enter optional narrative text for supporting context. An introductory portion focused on general science capacity assessment, followed by three sections targeting capabilities related to the foundational components of EarthMAP: (1) data and information integration, (2) integrated predictive science, and (3) actionable information.The survey results provided a high-level snapshot of USGS capacity in the targeted areas. Respondents (1,035 individuals) represented approximately 13 percent of the USGS across all mission areas and regions. Seventy-four percent of the respondents held a science-focused position title and the remainder had position titles in information technology, computer science, management, administrative, or other (contractors, volunteers, emeritus, and unknown). To provide greater insight into respondent capabilities and activities, information from the U.S. Department of the Interior and USGS enterprise information systems were used to further characterize topical expertise and organizational associations of survey respondents. To address the ongoing need to assess the Bureau’s capacity to address integrated predictive science priorities, the CAT developed a software-based proof-of-concept called the Integrated Science Assessment Information Database (iSAID) for assembling various information sources together toward making the full extent of USGS capabilities and scientific assets available for routine capacity assessment. This proof-of-concept is intended to serve as a catalyst for further development. The process of implementing the EarthMAP capacity assessment survey, analyzing survey responses, and developing the proof-of-concept resulted in lessons learned, findings, and recommendations. Example scenarios throughout the report demonstrate how capacity assessment data can inform science planning. Three overarching findings and recommendations are:(1) Finding: Capacity is limited in some critical disciplines, skills, and technology applications, but “sufficient” depends on the question and the need relative to availability at a given point in time.Recommendation: Develop an on-demand capacity assessment framework that enables rapid identification and evaluation of existing and available expertise to support decision needs as they arise.(2) Finding: Institutional barriers and lack of awareness constrain the ability of USGS staff to adopt new technologies, collaborate across administrative boundaries, and deliver actionable information to stakeholders in a timely manner. However, these barriers are not universally experienced.Recommendation: Pursue more targeted inquiries to clarify which institutional barriers are obstructing the adoption of new technologies and approaches or the sharing of expertise and equipment across organizational and regional boundaries. These inquiries should inform USGS leadership, mission areas, and regions whether policies can be revised or whether a lack of understanding is creating perceived obstacles. Highlight cases when staff have successfully adopted new technologies and approaches to advance EarthMAP priorities and provide actionable information in a timely manner to spread awareness of how perceived obstacles can be navigated and overcome when appropriate.(3) Finding: Examples of people and projects integrating across disciplines and scales and applying advanced approaches to meet complex stakeholder needs exist. Such examples provide transfer value across the spectrum from approach to decision making. Many projects, already underway, appear to meet elements of the EarthMAP vision, and the USGS has people who can provide leadership in multiple types of specific integrated science efforts.Recommendation: Use these findings as a starting point for near-term strategic planning for integrated science. Highlight, incentivize, and build on existing interdisciplinary predictive science and information delivery activities across the USGS to advance toward further realization of an EarthMAP capacity.The CAT efforts to develop and assess existing USGS capacity to advance the EarthMAP vision revealed a fundamental challenge for not only this effort but any effort to assess existing capacity: A considerable amount of thought, time, and effort is required to survey and assess capabilities and tools available to support a given need, yet best results are still likely to provide an incomplete assessment. To better meet the frequent need to assess capabilities, tools, products, and projects that address an expressed strategic priority, the CAT proposes the concept of an on-demand capacity assessment framework supported by a software package that dynamically pulls and integrates information from existing USGS information systems and public domain registries. Although existing USGS enterprise information systems currently lack the structure, cross-system consistency, interoperability, and stability to support a continuously updated capacity assessment capability, we identify reasonable near-term steps to improve the utility of information gathered on expertise and project capacity and to improve the consistency and completeness of information and the ability of USGS systems to share that information. The ability to search and characterize this information will make future assessments of capacity faster, more complete, more efficient, and more targeted. This approach would grow the Bureau’s capacity knowledge over time, iteratively improving the ability to access, leverage, and synthesize existing capabilities and assets as well as identify and fill critical gaps. The greatest promise for developing integrated science could lie in linking across existing projects and expertise to create a multi-project capacity for addressing large, complex environmental issues.

AB  - Objective: This study compares two maps of biomedical sciences using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) term co-assignments versus MeSH terms of citing/cited articles and reveals similarities and differences between the two approaches. Methods: MeSH terms assigned to 397,475 journal articles published in 2015, as well as their 4,632,992 cited references, were retrieved from Web of Science and MEDLINE databases, respectively, which formed over 7 million MeSH co-assignments and nearly 18 million direct citation pairs. We generated six network visualizations of biomedical science at three levels using Gephi software based on these MeSH co-assignments and citation pairs.Results: The MeSH co-assignment map contained more nodes and edges, as MeSH co-assignments cover all medical topics discussed in articles. By contrast, the MeSH citation map contained fewer but larger nodes and wider edges, as citation links indicate connections to two similar medical topics. Conclusion: These two types of maps emphasize different aspects of biomedical sciences, with MeSH co-assignment maps focusing on the relationship between topics in different categories and MeSH direct citation maps providing insights into relationships between topics in the same or similar category.

AB  - With the advent of distributed computing, the need for frameworks that facilitate its programming and management has also appeared. These tools have typically been used to support the research on application areas that require them. This poses good initial conditions for translational computer science (TCS), although this does not always occur. This article describes our experience with the PyCOMPSs project, a programming model for distributed computing. While it is a research instrument for our team, it has also been applied in multiple real use cases under the umbrella of European Funded projects, or as part of internal projects between various departments at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. This article illustrates how the authors have engaged in TCS as an underlying research methodology, collecting experiences from three European projects.

AB  - Innovation takes different forms: varying from path-breaking discoveries to adaptive changes that survive external shifts in the environment. Our paper investigates the nature and process of innovation in the traditional knowledge system of Ayurveda by tracing the footprints that innovation leaves in the academic research network of published papers from the PubMed database. Traditional knowledge systems defy the application of standard measures of innovation such as patents and patent citations. However, the continuity in content of these knowledge systems, which are studied using modern publication standards prescribed by academic journals, indicate a kind of adaptive innovation that we track using an author-affiliation based measure of homophily. Our investigation of this measure and its relationship with currently accepted standards of journal quality clearly shows how systems of knowledge can continue in an unbroken tradition without becoming extinct. Rather than no innovation, traditional knowledge systems evolve by adapting to modern standards of knowledge dissemination without significant alteration in their content.

AB  - We present the Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform (CONP) portal to answer the research community's need for flexible data sharing resources and provide advanced tools for search and processing infrastructure capacity. This portal differs from previous data sharing projects as it integrates datasets originating from a number of already existing platforms or databases through DataLad, a file level data integrity and access layer. The portal is also an entry point for searching and accessing a large number of standardized and containerized software and links to a computing infrastructure. It leverages community standards to help document and facilitate reuse of both datasets and tools, and already shows a growing community adoption giving access to more than 60 neuroscience datasets and over 70 tools. The CONP portal demonstrates the feasibility and offers a model of a distributed data and tool management system across 17 institutions throughout Canada.

AB  - Citations acknowledge the impact a scientific publication has on subsequent work. At the same time, deciding how and when to cite a paper, is also heavily influenced by social factors. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis based on a dataset of 2010-2012 global publications in chemical engineering. We use social network analysis and text mining to measure publication attributes and understand which variables can better help predicting their future success. Controlling for intrinsic quality of a publication and for the number of authors in the byline, we are able to predict scholarly impact of a paper in terms of citations received six years after publication with almost 80 percent accuracy. Results suggest that, all other things being equal, it is better to co-publish with rotating co-authors and write the papers' abstract using more positive words, and a more complex, thus more informative, language. Publications that result from the collaboration of different social groups also attract more citations.

AB  - Abstract In this study, the intellectual structure of the Iberoamerican research on Library and Information Science was visualized, from the perspective of journal citation relations. In addition, the core journals that most influence intellectual structure were identified. The study had a comparative emphasis since data from Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection were used. Journal co-citation maps were generated to identify the journal communities. Strategic diagrams with citation and betweenness centrality measures were also generated to identify core, under development, and peripheral journals. The results showed that the intellectual structure is fragmented into communities that respond to the geographic context and language affinity. Only two journals are considered core, El Profesional de la Información and Ciência da Informação. In general, there was not much difference in the comparative analyzes between the two databases. Complementary studies are necessary to show which epistemic factors influence the current fragmentation of the intellectual structure of the Library and Information Science research in the region.

AB  - The goal of text classification is to identify the category to which the text belongs. Text categorization is widely used in email detection, sentiment analysis, topic marking and other fields. However, good text representation is the point to improve the capability of NLP tasks. Traditional text representation adopts bag-of-words model or vector space model, which loses the context information of the text and faces the problems of high latitude and high sparsity,. In recent years, with the increase of data and the improvement of computing performance, the use of deep learning technology to represent and classify texts has attracted great attention. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and RNN with attention mechanism are used to represent the text, and then to classify the text and other NLP tasks, all of which have better performance than the traditional methods. In this paper, we design two sentence-level models based on the deep network and the details are as follows: (1) Text representation and classification model based on bidirectional RNN and CNN (BRCNN). BRCNN’s input is the word vector corresponding to each word in the sentence; after using RNN to extract word order information in sentences, CNN is used to extract higher-level features of sentences. After convolution, the maximum pool operation is used to obtain sentence vectors. At last, softmax classifier is used for classification. RNN can capture the word order information in sentences, while CNN can extract useful features. Experiments on eight text classification tasks show that BRCNN model can get better text feature representation, and the classification accuracy rate is equal to or higher than that of the prior art. (2) Attention mechanism and CNN (ACNN) model uses the RNN with attention mechanism to obtain the context vector; Then CNN is used to extract more advanced feature information. The maximum pool operation is adopted to obtain a sentence vector; At last, the softmax classifier is used to classify the text. Experiments on eight text classification benchmark data sets show that ACNN improves the stability of model convergence, and can converge to an optimal or local optimal solution better than BRCNN.

AB  - With the increasing frequency of scientific cooperation, research on the impact of scientific cooperation on scholars’ scientific performance has become a hot topic in academic research. This paper mainly uses quantitative research methods such as bibliometrics and social network analysis to analyze the correlation between degree centrality, L-index, and scientific performance of the Chinese author of Physical Education and Training Science and draws the following conclusions: (1) degree centrality is positively correlated with the number of papers, average citations per paper, and H-index and (2) L-index is positively correlated with the number of papers, average citations per paper, and H-index. Unlike previous studies on scientific collaboration networks and scholars’ performance that focused on traditional network characteristics indicators, this study introduces a new network characteristics indicator, L-index, through which the degree of collaboration between authors and other important authors in the research field can be better assessed, which also provides a new direction for research related to research collaboration networks and scholars’ performance; at the same time, it also provides a theoretical basis for subsequent research on the utility of scientific collaboration, a reference for the assessment of the research performance of scholars in other disciplines, and a theoretical reference for more scientific and comprehensive prediction of scholars’ research performance in the future.

AB  - Text classification is the task of estimating the genre of a document based on information such as word co-occurrence and frequency of occurrence. Text classification has been studied by various approaches. In this study, we focused on text classification using graph structure data. Conventional graph-based methods express relationships between words and relationships between words and documents as weights between nodes. Then, a graph neural network is used for learning. However, there is a problem that conventional methods are not able to represent the relationship between documents on the graph. In this paper, we propose a graph structure that considers the relationships between documents. In the proposed method, the cosine similarity of document vectors is set as weights between document nodes. This completes a graph that considers the relationship between documents. The graph is then input into a graph convolutional neural network for training. Therefore, the aim of this study is to improve the text classification performance of conventional methods by using this graph that considers the relationships between document nodes. In this study, we conducted evaluation experiments using five different corpora of English documents. The results showed that the proposed method outperformed the performance of the conventional method by up to 1.19%, indicating that the use of relationships between documents is effective. In addition, the proposed method was shown to be particularly effective in classifying long documents.

AB  - Due to the exponential growth of online textual data and the variety of its sources, there is a need to produce an accurate text summary with the least time and effort.Extractive multi-document text summarization methods are intended to automatically generate summaries from a document collection, covering the main content and avoiding redundant information.In this study, a new method for extractive multi-document summarization has been proposed based on the combination of supervised and unsupervised learning.Throughout the supervised learning, a set of seven features was extracted from each sentence in the document collection and introduces to the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), to distinguish between important and unimportant sentences.A graph of important sentences was generated and assigned scores by the LexRank algorithm during the unsupervised learning.The performance of the proposed method on the DUC-2002 dataset was calculated using ROUGE evaluation metrics.The proposed method achieved a 0.47472 ROUGE for 200-word summaries and 0.54641 ROUGE for 400-word summaries.

AB  - The advent of large-scale cabled ocean observatories brought about the need to handle large amounts of ocean-based data, continuously recorded at a high sampling rate over many years and made accessible in near-real time to the ocean science community and the public. Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) commenced installing and operating two regional cabled observatories on Canada’s Pacific Coast, VENUS inshore and NEPTUNE offshore in the 2000s, and later expanded to include observatories in the Atlantic and Arctic in the 2010s. The first data streams from the cabled instrument nodes started flowing in February 2006. This paper describes Oceans 2.0 and Oceans 3.0 , the comprehensive Data Management and Archival System that ONC developed to capture all data and associated metadata into an ever-expanding dynamic database. Oceans 2.0 was the name for this software system from 2006–2021; in 2022, ONC revised this name to Oceans 3.0, reflecting the system’s many new and planned capabilities aligning with Web 3.0 concepts. Oceans 3.0 comprises both tools to manage the data acquisition and archival of all instrumental assets managed by ONC as well as end-user tools to discover, process, visualize and download the data. Oceans 3.0 rests upon ten foundational pillars: (1) A robust and stable system architecture to serve as the backbone within a context of constant technological progress and evolving needs of the operators and end users; (2) a data acquisition and archival framework for infrastructure management and data recording, including instrument drivers and parsers to capture all data and observatory actions, alongside task management options and support for data versioning; (3) a metadata system tracking all the details necessary to archive Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reproducible (FAIR) data from all scientific and non-scientific sensors; (4) a data Quality Assurance and Quality Control lifecycle with a consistent workflow and automated testing to detect instrument, data and network issues; (5) a data product pipeline ensuring the data are served in a wide variety of standard formats; (6) data discovery and access tools, both generalized and use-specific, allowing users to find and access data of interest; (7) an Application Programming Interface that enables scripted data discovery and access; (8) capabilities for customized and interactive data handling such as annotating videos or ingesting individual campaign-based data sets; (9) a system for generating persistent data identifiers and data citations, which supports interoperability with external data repositories; (10) capabilities to automatically detect and react to emergent events such as earthquakes. With a growing database and advancing technological capabilities, Oceans 3.0 is evolving toward a future in which the old paradigm of downloading packaged data files transitions to the new paradigm of cloud-based environments for data discovery, processing, analysis, and exchange.

AB  - Abstract Text classification is a widely studied problem and has broad applications. In many real-world problems, the number of texts for training classification models is limited, which renders these models prone to overfitting. To address this problem, we propose SSL-Reg, a data-dependent regularization approach based on self-supervised learning (SSL). SSL (Devlin et al., 2019a) is an unsupervised learning approach that defines auxiliary tasks on input data without using any human-provided labels and learns data representations by solving these auxiliary tasks. In SSL-Reg, a supervised classification task and an unsupervised SSL task are performed simultaneously. The SSL task is unsupervised, which is defined purely on input texts without using any human- provided labels. Training a model using an SSL task can prevent the model from being overfitted to a limited number of class labels in the classification task. Experiments on 17 text classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Code is available at https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/SSReg.

AB  - In the multi-label text classification task, a text usually corresponds to multiple label categories, and the labels have correlation and hierarchical structure. However, when the label hierarchy is unknown, the number of various labels is not balanced, which makes it difficult for the model to classify low-frequency labels. At the same time, due to the existence of similar labels, the model will be difficult to distinguish similar labels. In this paper, we propose a multi-label text classification model based on multi-level constraint augmentation and label association attention. Compared with traditional methods, our method has two contributions: (1) In order to alleviate the problem of unbalanced number of different label categories and ensure the rationality of sample generation, we propose a data augmentation method based on multi-level constraints. In the process of sample generation, this method uses historical generation information, sample original text information and sample topic to constrain the generated text. (2) In order to make the model recognize the associated labels accurately, we propose an interaction mechanism based on label association attention and filter gate. This method combines text information and label weight information. At the same time, our classification model considers the important weights of text sentences and effectively utilizes the co-occurrence relationship between labels. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all main evaluation metrics, especially on low-frequency label prediction with sparse samples.

AB  - Summary Scholars worldwide leverage science gateways/virtual research environments (VREs) for a wide variety of research and education endeavors spanning diverse scientific fields. Evaluating the value of a given science gateway/VRE to its constituent community is critical in obtaining the financial and human resources necessary to sustain operations and increase adoption in the user community. In this article, we feature a variety of exemplar science gateways/VREs and detail how they define impact in terms of, for example, their purpose, operation principles, and size of user base. Further, the exemplars recognize that their science gateways/VREs will continuously evolve with technological advancements and standards in cloud computing platforms, web service architectures, data management tools and cybersecurity. Correspondingly, we present a number of technology advances that could be incorporated in next‐generation science gateways/VREs to enhance their scope and scale of their operations for greater success/impact. The exemplars are selected from owners of science gateways in the Science Gateways Community Institute (SGCI) clientele in the United States, and from the owners of VREs in the International Virtual Research Environment Interest Group (VRE‐IG) of the Research Data Alliance. Thus, community‐driven best practices and technology advances are compiled from diverse expert groups with an international perspective to envisage futuristic science gateway/VRE innovations.

AB  - Zero-shot multi-label text classification (ZMTC) is a fundamental task in natural language processing with applications in the cold start problem of recommendation systems. Ideally, one would learn an expressive representation of both input text and label features so that ZMTC is transformed into a nearest neighbor search problem. However, the existing representation learning approaches for ZMTC struggle with accuracy as well as poor training efficiency. Firstly, the input text is structural, consisting of both short title sentences and long content paragraphs. It is challenging to model the correlation between short label descriptions and long structural input documents. Secondly, the enormous label space in ZMTC forces the existing approaches to perform multi-stage learning with label engineering. As a result, the training overhead is significant. In this paper, we address both problems by introducing an end-to-end structural contrastive representation learning approach. We propose a randomized text segmentation (RTS) technique to generate high-quality contrastive pairs. This RTS technique allows us to model title-content correlation. Additionally, we simplify the multi-stage ZMTC learning strategy by avoiding label engineering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach leads to up to 2.33% improvement in precision@1 and 5.94x speedup in training time on publicly available datasets. Our code is available publicly.

AB  - Abstract In the past, several works have investigated ways for combining quantitative and qualitative methods in research assessment exercises. Indeed, the Italian National Scientific Qualification (NSQ), i.e. the national assessment exercise which aims at deciding whether a scholar can apply to professorial academic positions as Associate Professor and Full Professor, adopts a quantitative and qualitative evaluation process: it makes use of bibliometrics followed by a peer-review process of candidates’ CVs. The NSQ divides academic disciplines into two categories, i.e. citation-based disciplines (CDs) and non-citation-based disciplines (NDs), a division that affects the metrics used for assessing the candidates of that discipline in the first part of the process, which is based on bibliometrics. In this work, we aim at exploring whether citation-based metrics, calculated only considering open bibliographic and citation data, can support the human peer-review of NDs and yield insights on how it is conducted. To understand if and what citation-based (and, possibly, other) metrics provide relevant information, we created a series of machine learning models to replicate the decisions of the NSQ committees. As one of the main outcomes of our study, we noticed that the strength of the citational relationship between the candidate and the commission in charge of assessing his/her CV seems to play a role in the peer-review phase of the NSQ of NDs.

AB  - This work is to reduce the workload of teachers in English teaching and improve the writing level of students, so as to provide a way for students to practice English composition scoring independently and satisfy the needs of college teachers and students for intelligent English composition scoring and intelligently generated comments. In this work, it firstly clarifies the teaching requirements of college English classrooms and expounds the principles and advantages of machine learning technology. Secondly, a three-layer neural network model (NNM) is constructed by using the multilayer perceptron (MLP), combined with the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithm. Furthermore, three semantic representation vector technologies, including word vector, paragraph vector, and full-text vector feature, are used to represent the full-text vocabulary of English composition. Then, a model based on the K-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm is proposed to generate English composition evaluation, and a final score based on the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model is proposed. Finally, a model dataset is constructed using 800 college students' English essays for the CET-4 mock test, and the model is tested. The research results show that the semantic representation vector technology proposed can more effectively extract the lexical semantic features of English compositions. The XGBoost model and the kNN algorithm model are used to score and evaluate English compositions, which improves the accuracy of the scores. This makes the management of the entire scoring model more efficient and more accurate. It means that the model proposed is better than the traditional model in terms of evaluation accuracy. This work provides a new direction for the application of artificial intelligence technology in English teaching under the background of modern information technology.

AB  - Computational experiments have been very important to numerically simulate real phenomena in several areas. Many studies in computational biology discuss the necessity to obtain numerical replicability to accomplish new investigations. However, even following well-established rules in the literature, numerical replicability is unsuccessful when it takes the computer's limitations for representing real numbers into consideration. In this study, we used a previous published recurrent network model composed by Hodgkin-Huxley-type neurons to simulate the neural activity during development. The original source code in C/C++ was carefully refactored to mitigate the lack of replicability; moreover, it was re-implemented to other programming languages/software (XPP/XPPAUT, Python and Matlab) and executed under two operating systems (Windows and Linux). The commutation and association of the input current values during the summation of the pre-synaptic activity were also analyzed. A total of 72 simulations which must obtain the same result were executed to cover these scenarios. The results were replicated when the high floating-point precision (supplied by third-party libraries) was used. However, using the default floating-point precision type, none of the results were replicated when compared with previous results. Several new procedures were proposed during the source code refactorization; they allowed replicating only a few scenarios, regardless of the language and operating system. Thus, the generated computational "errors" were the same. Even using a simple computational model, the numerical replicability was very difficult to be achieved, requiring people with computational expertise to be performed. After all, the research community must be aware that conducting analyses with numerical simulations that use real number operations can lead to different conclusions.

AB  - Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) is an essential and challenging subtask of multi-label text classification with a taxonomic hierarchy. Recent advances in deep learning and pre-trained language models have led to significant breakthroughs in the HTC problem. However, despite their effectiveness, these methods are often restricted by a lack of domain knowledge, which leads them to make mistakes in a variety of situations. Generally, when manually classifying a specific document to the taxonomic hierarchy, experts make inference based on their prior knowledge and experience. For machines to achieve this capability, we propose a novel Knowledge-enabled Hierarchical Text Classification model (K-HTC), which incorporates knowledge graphs into HTC. Specifically, K-HTC innovatively integrates knowledge into both the text representation and hierarchical label learning process, addressing the knowledge limitations of traditional methods. Additionally, a novel knowledge-aware contrastive learning strategy is proposed to further exploit the information inherent in the data. Extensive experiments on two publicly available HTC datasets show the efficacy of our proposed method, and indicate the necessity of incorporating knowledge graphs in HTC tasks.

AB  - Assigning predefined classes to natural language texts, based on their content, is a necessary component in many tasks in organizations. This task is carried out by classifying documents within a set of predefined categories using models and computational methods. Text representation for classification purposes has traditionally been performed using a vector space model due to its good performance and simplicity. Moreover, the classification of texts via multilabeling has typically been approached by using simple label classification methods, which require the transformation of the problem studied to apply binary techniques, or by adapting binary algorithms. Over the previous decade, text classification has been extended using deep learning models. Compared to traditional machine learning methods, deep learning avoids rule design and feature selection by humans, and automatically provides semantically meaningful representations for text analysis. However, deep learning-based text classification is data-intensive and computationally complex. Interest in deep learning models does not rule out techniques and models based on shallow learning. This situation is true when the set of training cases is smaller, and when the set of features is small. White box approaches have advantages over black box approaches, where the feasibility of working with relatively small sets of data and the interpretability of the results stand out. This research evaluates a weighting function of the words in texts to modify the representation of the texts during multilabel classification, using a combination of two approaches: problem transformation and model adaptation. This weighting function was tested in 10 referential textual data sets, and compared with alternative techniques based on three performance measures: Hamming Loss, Accuracy, and macro-F1. The best improvement occurs on the macro-F1 when the data sets have fewer labels, fewer documents, and smaller vocabulary sizes. In addition, the performance improves in data sets with higher cardinality, density, and diversity of labels. This proves the usefulness of the function on smaller data sets. The results show improvements of more than 10% in terms of macro-F1 in classifiers based on our method in almost all of the cases analyzed.

AB  - This paper aimed to provide an approach to investigate the historical roots and evolution of research fields in China by extending the reference publication year spectroscopy (RPYS). RootCite, an open source software accepts raw data from both the Web of Science and the China Social Science Citation Index (CSSCI), was developed using python. We took iMetrics in China as the research case. 5,141 Chinese iMetrics related publications with 73,376 non-distinct cited references (CR) collected from the CSSCI were analyzed using RootCite. The results showed that the first CR in the field can be dated back to 1882 and written in English; but the majority (64.2%) of the CR in the field were Chinese publications. 17 peaks referring to 18 seminal works (13 in English and 5 in Chinese) were located during the period from 1900 to 2017. The field shared the same roots with that in the English world but has its own characteristics, and it was then shaped by contributions from both the English world and China. The five Chinese works have played irreplaceable and positive roles in the historical evolutionary path of the field, which should not be ignored, especially for the evolution of the field. This research demonstrated how RootCite aided the task of identifying the origin and evolution of research fields in China, which could be valuable for extending RPYS for countries with other languages.

AB  - In the machine learning jargon, multi-label classification refers to a task where multiple mutually non-exclusive class labels are assigned to a single instance. Generally, the lack of sufficient labeled training data demanded by a classification task is met by an approach known as semi-supervised learning. This type of learning extracts the decision rules of classification by utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data. Regarding multi-label data, however, current semi-supervised learning methods are unable to classify them accurately. Therefore, with the goal of generalizing the state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches to multi-label data, this paper proposes a novel two-stage method for multi-label semi-supervised classification. The first stage determines the label(s) of the unlabeled training data by means of a smooth graph constructed using the manifold regularization. In the second stage, thanks to the capability of the twin support vector machine to relax the requirement that hyperplanes should be parallel in classical SVM, we employ it to establish a multi-label classifier called LP-MLTSVM. In the experiments, this classifier is applied on benchmark datasets. The simulation results substantiate that compared to the existing multi-label classification algorithms, LP-MLTSVM shows superior performance in terms of the Hamming loss, average precision, coverage, ranking loss, and one-error metrics.

AB  - Background: Mapping scientific trends is one of the most important missions of scientometric research for effective research. The main goal of this paper was to visualize and draw the intellectual and cognitive structures of information retrieval (IR) in the medical sciences using science mapping. Methods: In this cross-sectional scientometric study, we recruited all documents indexed in the Web of Science database with the topic of storing and retrieval of information in medical sciences. To analyze the results, 3 software, SciMAT-v1.1.04, VOSviewer-v1.6.14, CitNetExplorer_v1.0.0, were used. Results: Our results showed that most scientific productions in this field fall into 2 categories: (1) effective methods of organizing information and (2) application and operation of the IR system in the process of intelligent questioning and answering, and analyzing information behaviors of physicians and health professionals. The results showed that the similarity index increased over time from 0.43 to 0.71. Analysis of the findings showed that similarity measures, expert systems, concepts, experience, answers, and multimodel IR clusters were considered as mature and completely centralized clusters in the first quarter of the strategic chart. Conclusion: Because of the dramatic approximation of the vocabulary used by researchers and a relative slowdown in the growth rate of the subject's domain in the last decade, it seems necessary to pay attention to the expansion of the fields of IR and the application of its concepts in medical information sciences. Also, it can be recommended that designers of IR systems and techniques in medical information sciences pay more attention to human factors attentively to develop new technologies and tools.

AB  - In scientific collaboration, data sharing, the exchange of ideas and results are essential to knowledge construction and the development of science. Hence, we must guarantee interoperability, privacy, traceability (reinforcing transparency), and trust. Provenance has been widely recognized for providing a history of the steps taken in scientific experiments. Consequently, we must support traceability, assisting in scientific results’ reproducibility. One of the technologies that can enhance trust in collaborative scientific experimentation is blockchain. This work proposes an architecture, named BlockFlow, based on blockchain, provenance, and cloud infrastructure to bring trust and traceability in the execution of collaborative scientific experiments. The proposed architecture is implemented on Hyperledger, and a scenario about the genomic sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is used to evaluate the architecture, discussing the benefits of providing traceability and trust in collaborative scientific experimentation. Furthermore, the architecture addresses the heterogeneity of shared data, facilitating interpretation by geographically distributed researchers and analysis of such data. Through a blockchain-based architecture that provides support on provenance and blockchain, we can enhance data sharing, traceability, and trust in collaborative scientific experiments.

AB  - Abstract Mentorship in science is crucial for topic choice, career decisions, and the success of mentees and mentors. Typically, researchers who study mentorship use article co-authorship and doctoral dissertation datasets. However, available datasets of this type focus on narrow selections of fields and miss out on early career and non-publication-related interactions. Here, we describe Mentorship, a crowdsourced dataset of 743176 mentorship relationships among 738989 scientists primarily in biosciences that avoids these shortcomings. Our dataset enriches the Academic Family Tree project by adding publication data from the Microsoft Academic Graph and “semantic” representations of research using deep learning content analysis. Because gender and race have become critical dimensions when analyzing mentorship and disparities in science, we also provide estimations of these factors. We perform extensive validations of the profile–publication matching, semantic content, and demographic inferences, which mostly cover neuroscience and biomedical sciences. We anticipate this dataset will spur the study of mentorship in science and deepen our understanding of its role in scientists’ career outcomes.

AB  - Lineage information is the part of the metadata that describes “what”, “when”, “who”, “how”, and “where” geospatial data were generated. If it is well-presented and queryable, lineage becomes very useful information for inferring data quality, tracing error sources and increasing trust in geospatial information. In addition, if the lineage of a collection of datasets can be related and presented together, datasets, process chains, and methodologies can be compared. This paper proposes extending process step lineage descriptions into four explicit levels of abstraction (process run, tool, algorithm and functionality). Including functionalities and algorithm descriptions as a part of lineage provides high-level information that is independent from the details of the software used. Therefore, it is possible to transform lineage metadata that is initially documenting specific processing steps into a reusable workflow that describes a set of operations as a processing chain. This paper presents a system that provides lineage information as a service in a distributed environment. The system is complemented by an integrated provenance web application that is capable of visualizing and querying a provenance graph that is composed by the lineage of a collection of datasets. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 19115 standards family with World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) provenance initiative (W3C PROV) were combined in order to integrate provenance of a collection of datasets. To represent lineage elements, the ISO 19115-2 lineage class names were chosen, because they express the names of the geospatial objects that are involved more precisely. The relationship naming conventions of W3C PROV are used to represent relationships among these elements. The elements and relationships are presented in a queryable graph.

AB  - Abstract In recent years, the “science of science” has combined computational methods with novel data sources to understand the dynamics of research communities. Many of the questions investigated by science of science are also relevant to academic philosophy. To what extent can the discipline be divided into subfields with different methods and topics? How are prestige and credit distributed across the discipline? And how do these factors interact with other factors, such as gender, to shape job market outcomes? Using job market data for anglophone academic philosophy, this paper finds, first, evidence that is consistent with the analytic‐continental divide but is also consistent with other, more complex ways of organizing academic philosophy into distinct intellectual traditions; second, a clear prestige hierarchy, dividing Ph.D. programs into two distinct prestige categories; and, third, evidence that gender, prestige, and country have notable effects on academic job market outcomes for recent philosophy Ph.Ds.

KW  - Data Sharing
AB  - The North Atlantic Biocultural Organization (NABO) community initiated dataARC to develop digital research infrastructures to support their work on long-term human-ecodynamics in the North Atlantic. These infrastructures were designed to address the challenges of sharing research data, the connections between those data and high-level interpretations, and the interpretations themselves. In parallel, they were also designed to support the reuse of diverse data that underpin transdisciplinary synthesis research and to contextualise materials disseminated widely to the public more firmly in their evidence base. This article outlines the research infrastructure produced by the project and reflects on its design and development. We outline the core motivations for dataARC's work and introduce the tools, platforms and (meta)data products developed. We then undertake a critical review of the project's workflow. This review focuses on our understanding of the needs of stakeholder groups, the principles that guided the design of the infrastructure, and the extent to which these principles are successfully promoted in the current implementation. Drawing on this assessment, we consider how the infrastructure, in whole or in part, might be reused by other transdisciplinary research communities. Finally, we highlight key socio-technical gaps that may emerge as structural barriers to transdisciplinary, engaged, and open research if left unaddressed.

AB  - Abstract Multiple institutional affiliations (or co-affiliations) occur when an academic belongs to more than one organisation. Recent research shows an increase in academics with multiple affiliations, but evidence on how these are organised and on academics’ motivations is mainly anecdotal. In this study we develop a typology of co-affiliations, which identifies four types based on their purpose and origin. We draw on results from a unique international survey of academics in three major science nations (the UK, Germany, and Japan) to study the different factors that could explain the four types of co-affiliations. The analysis shows that academics’ motivations (networking/prestige, resources, teaching, or personal income) correlate with the observed co-affiliation type. Researcher-initiated and research-focussed co-affiliations are often motivated by networking and resource access while co-affiliations that serve other than research purposes are more often income-motivated.

AB  - Abstract In last years Artificial Intelligence presented a tremendous progress by offering a variety of novel methods, tools and their spectacular applications. Besides showing scientific breakthroughs it attracted interest both of the general public and industry. It also opened heated debates on the impact of Artificial Intelligence on changing the economy and society. Having in mind this international landscape, in this short paper we discuss the Polish AI research community, some of its main achievements, opportunities and limitations. We put this discussion in the context of the current developments in the international AI community. Moreover, we refer to activities of Polish scientific associations and their initiative of founding Polish Alliance for the Development of Artificial Intelligence (PP-RAI). Finally two last editions of PP-RAI joint conferences are summarized.

AB  - To enhance the performance of the personalized tag recommendation method, a microblog video topic discovery algorithm based on common knowledge atlas analysis was proposed. Firstly, graphical form was used for expressing latent local expression in the microblog video topic and top-k similar user discovery of users represented by user topic distribution. Then, the frequency of all the tags occurring in these users was calculated and the tags most relevant with users were recommended. Next, to mine potential topic information, enhanced cosine similarity RTM model with penalty term was used for naming the tag of topic for microblog video, which enhanced the impact of united modeling on tag generation for potential topic and might discover the relationship between global tab and topic. At last, the real experiment result showed that the recommended method was superior to typical tag recommendation algorithms of several selected microblog video topics. Meanwhile, the validity of the algorithm was verified.

AB  - Abstract The SALURBAL (Urban Health in Latin America) Project is an interdisciplinary multinational network aimed at generating and disseminating actionable evidence on the drivers of health in cities of Latin America. We conducted a temporal multilayer network analysis where we measured cohesion over time using network structural properties and assessed diversity within and between different project activities according to participant attributes. Between 2017 and 2020 the SALURBAL network comprised 395 participants across 26 countries, 23 disciplines, and 181 institutions. While the cohesion of the SALURBAL network fluctuated over time, overall, an increase was observed from the first to the last time point of our analysis (clustering coefficient increased [0.83–0.91] and shortest path decreased [1.70–1.68]). SALURBAL also exhibited balanced overall diversity within project activities (0.5–0.6) by designing activities for different purposes such as capacity building, team-building, research, and dissemination. The network’s growth was facilitated by the creation of new diverse collaborations across a range of activities over time, while maintaining the diversity of existing collaborations (0.69–0.75 between activity diversity depending on the attribute). The SALURBAL experience can serve as an example for multinational research projects aiming to build cohesive networks while leveraging heterogeneity in countries, disciplines, career stage, and across sectors.

AB  - Purpose This paper presents a follow-on study that quantifies geolingual markers and their apparent connection with authorship collaboration patterns in canonical Digital Humanities (DH) journals. In particular, it seeks to detect patterns in authors' countries of work and languages in co-authorship networks. Design/methodology/approach Through an in-depth co-authorship network analysis, this study analysed bibliometric data from three canonical DH journals over a range of 52 years (1966–2017). The results are presented as visualised networks with centrality calculations. Findings The results suggest that while DH scholars may not collaborate as frequently as those in other disciplines, when they do so their collaborations tend to be more international than in many Science and Engineering, and Social Sciences disciplines. DH authors in some countries (e.g. Spain, Finland, Australia, Canada, and the UK) have the highest international co-author rates, while others have high national co-author rates but low international rates (e.g. Japan, the USA, and France). Originality/value This study is the first DH co-authorship network study that explores the apparent connection between language and collaboration patterns in DH. It contributes to ongoing debates about diversity, representation, and multilingualism in DH and academic publishing more widely.

AB  - The growth and popularization of platforms on scientific production has been the subject of several studies, producing relevant analyses of co-authorship behavior among groups of researchers. Researchers and their scientific productions can be analysed as co-authorship social networks, so researchers are linked through common publications. In this context, co-authoring networks can be analysed to find patterns that can describe or characterize them. This work presents the analysis and characterization of co-authorship networks of academic Brazilian graduate programs in computer science. Data from Brazilian researchers were collected and modeled as co-authoring networks among the graduate programs that researchers take part in. Each network topology was analysed with complex network measurements and three proposed qualitative indices that evaluate the publication’s quality. In addition, the co-authorship networks of the computer science graduate programs were characterized in relation to the assessment received by CAPES, which attributes a qualitative grade to the graduate programs in Brazil. The results show the most relevant topological measurements for the program’s characterization and the evaluations received by the programs in different qualitative degrees, relating the main topological patterns of the co-authorship networks and the CAPES grades of the Brazilian graduate programs in computer science.

AB  - Abstract We propose a scale-invariant derivative of the h- index as “ h -dimension”, which is analogous to the fractal dimension of the h- index for institutional performance analysis. The design of h- dimension comes from the self-similar characteristics of the citation structure. We applied this h -dimension to data of 134 Japanese national universities and research institutes, and found well-performing medium-sized research institutes, where we identified multiple organizations related to natural disasters. This result is reasonable considering that Japan is frequently hit by earthquakes, typhoons, volcanoes and other natural disasters. However, these characteristic institutes are screened by larger universities if we depend on the existing h -index. The scale-invariant property of the proposed method helps to understand the nature of academic activities, which must promote fair and objective evaluation of research activities to maximize intellectual, and eventually economic opportunity.

AB  - Abstract Co-authored publications can bring positive results for those who participate, such as gaining additional expertise, accessing more funding or increasing the publication impact. China, the European Union, and the United States have been collaborating between each other throughout the years in the field of Computer Science. These collaborations varied over time, as well as they impacted the regions in different ways. In this paper, we collected the publications from these territories across 31 years on the topic of Computer Science and studied them focusing on how the regions have approached co-authorship. In particular, we have analyzed the number of collaborations during that period, the impact of those papers measured as the number of citations, and the topics that have been researched. We conclude that China’s focus on Computer Science fields has led it to be the most productive region in recent years; plus, it has benefited from the American and European reputation, by increasing its citation rates when collaborating with them. On the other hand, the EU and the US have benefited from Chinese interest in computer science, increasing the number of publications together.

AB  - Commercial bibliometric databases, and the quantitative indicators presented by them, are widely used for research assessment purposes, which is not fair for the humanities. The humanities are different from all other areas by nature in many aspects. This study aimed to show the extent of the difference in terms of five size-independent bibliometric indicators, based on citations and collaborations. We used categorical InCites data (1980–2020) to compare six main Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) subject areas, and the 45,987 sources of humanities, to make a comparison for subareas of the humanities. Results showed that the humanities are statistically different from all other areas, including social sciences, with high effect sizes in terms of the five indicators taken into consideration. Besides that, all the subareas of the humanities differ from each other. This main finding indicates that the humanities do not need new indicators for quantitative evaluation, but different approaches for assessment, such as bottom-up approaches.

AB  - Concept prerequisite learning (CPL) plays a key role in developing technologies that assist people to learn a new complex topic or concept. Previous work commonly assumes that all concepts are given at training time and solely focuses on predicting the unseen prerequisite relationships between them. However, many real-world scenarios deal with concepts that are left undiscovered at training time, which is relatively unexplored. This paper studies this problem and proposes a novel alternating knowledge distillation approach to take advantage of both content- and graph-based models for this task. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate up to 10% improvements in terms of F1 score.

AB  - Label embedding is an important family of multi-label classification algorithms which can jointly extract the information of all labels for better performance. However, few works have been done to develop the multi-label embedding methods that can effectively deal with the interference of noisy data during training process. The noise often makes the labels of a few samples incorrect ( <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">i.e.</i> , missing or mislabeled), which could lead to a poor learning performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel cross-view based model. It performs a robust and discriminant embedding, namely Robust Cross-view Embedding with Discriminant Structure for Multi-label Classification (RCEDS). In RCEDS, a novel hypergraph fusion technique is designed to explore and utilize the complementary between the feature space and the label space to make the proposed RCEDS robust. Meanwhile, we use double-side metric learning to mine the consistency between the feature space and the label space to effectively improve the discriminative ability of our proposed RCEDS. Furthermore, we conduct a deep extension of RCEDS and effectively apply it to image annotation. Extensive experimental results on data sets with many labels demonstrate that our proposed approach can attain better classification performance than the existing label embedding algorithms.

AB  - The past years have seen a flurry of activity in distributed computing and its related fields. Indeed, developments in computer communications and networks enabled the deployment of exciting new areas, including internet of things, vehicular networks, collaborative big data analysis and so on. The design and implementation of energy efficient future generation communication and networking technologies fostered the development of mobile, pervasive and large-scale computing technologies. The International Conference on Computing and Communications Networks (ICCCN 2022) aims to serve as a forum for exchanging the latest findings and experiences ranging from theoretical research to practical system development in all aspects of computing and networking. All submitted papers must have a substantial knowledge engineering component like AI/machine learning, etc. to be in scope of this special issue, otherwise the paper will get rejected straightaway. This special issue brings selected papers presented at the ICCCN 2022 conference. From around 45 submitted articles, only 13 papers were selected based on the reviews. Each paper was reviewed by at least two reviewers and went through at least two rounds of reviews. The brief contributions of these papers are discussed below. In the first paper of this special issue, the authors Minni Jain et al. (2023) have proposed the first approach for code-mixed Hindi–English social media text that comprises language identification, detection and correction of non-word (out of vocabulary) errors as well as real-word errors occurring simultaneously. A fuzzy graph between different words of the suggestive lists is generated using various semantic relations in Hindi WordNet. Word embeddings and fuzzy graph-based centrality measures are used to find the correct word. Several experiments are performed on different social media datasets taken from Instagram, Twitter, YouTube comments, Blogs and WhatsApp. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system corrects out-of-vocabulary words as well as real-word errors with a maximum recall of 0.90 and 0.67, respectively, for Dev_Hindi and 0.87 and 0.66, respectively, for Rom_Hindi. The authors Ritu Bibyan et al. (2023) in their study have proposed a prediction model based on LDA to study the content aspect and emotion analysis to study the sentiment aspect. The model is validated on the datasets were collected from the Eclipse project using convolutional neural network (CNN). The results show that the CNN model effectively utilizes the content and sentiment aspect of the data to handle the severity prediction. It also improves generalization and overfitting is avoided. In the paper by Anshika Arora, Chakraborty, et al. (2023), the authors present a novel methodology for assessment of objective sleep quality using actigraph recordings of motor activity. High level features of sequential motor activity data are extracted using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model, which are then paired with a significant statistical feature, namely zero percent, which describes the percentage of events with zero activity over a series. The predictive ability of the combined feature vector is evaluated using support vector machine (SVM) classifier. This hybrid LSTM-SVM framework is validated on a benchmark dataset, namely, the MESA Actigraphy dataset, and achieves an accuracy of 85.62% for sleep quality prediction. It is validated that the concept of overlapping sliding window improves the performance accuracy by 3.51%, and the use of discriminative statistical feature improves sleep quality prediction task by 2.95%. Comparison with state of the art validates that this is the first study using objective sleep quality indicator for assessment of sleep quality via actigraph-based motor activity data. In the next paper, the authors Dimple Sethi et al. (2023) have proposed a gait analysis in a markerless environment and divided into three stages: First, a markerless gait database using videos from MNIT RAMAN LABORA-TORY in Jaipur has been prepared. Second, the skeletal landmark data to generate kinematic gait characteristics comparable to gold standard marker-based techniques have been adapted. Third, MF-GA (multi-feature based gait analysis), an ensemble model based on CNN + LSTM, for gait classification, has been developed. The findings indicate that gait analysis can be used successfully in a low-cost clinical gait monitoring system in a constraint-free environment. Our model for quantifying gait analysis will improve access to quantitative gait analysis in clinics and rehabilitation centres and enable researchers to conduct large-scale studies for gait-related disorders. In another research, the authors Awanish Kumar Mishra et al. (2023) introduced an automated Cervical Precancerous Lesion Classification using Quantum Invasive Weed Optimization with Deep Learning (CPLC-QIWODL) on biomedical pap smear images. The presented CPLC-QIWODL technique examines the pap smear images for cervical cancer classification. Moreover, the CPLC-QIWODL technique uses a deep convolutional neural network-based SqueezeNet system for feature extraction. Furthermore, the hyperparameter tuning of the SqueezeNet methodology takes place using the QIWO technique, showing the novelty of the work. Finally, to classify CC, the deep variational autoencoder (DVAE) model is applied. The experimental result analysis of the CPLC-QIWODL technique is tested using a benchmark CPLC-QIWODL technique over other existing algorithms, with a maximum accuracy of medical image database. Extensive comparative results demonstrated the enhanced outcomes of 99.07%. The authors Qiming Zhang et al. (2023) have proposed a marine radar monitoring internet-of-things system to make full use of radar echo and AIS information and improve the accuracy of target detection, in which marine radars work in both scanning and staring modes. By adopting image segmentation and deep learning methods, the proposed design can enable accurate perception of weak target detection based on plan-position indicator (PPI) images. A case study based on the selected X-band radar datasets shows that the proposed design can achieve high target identification accuracy. In the next paper, the authors Minzhi He et al. (2023) have studied and evaluated the application of computed tomography (CT) images based on a predictive intelligent algorithm in enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) in patients with laparoscopic-assisted distal gastrectomy. An intelligent algorithm model of image prediction was established to collect lymph node metastasis data, and the clinical data of the two groups were compared. The results showed that 54 cases of lymph node metastasis were predicted by the images, and the actual incidence of lymph node metastasis was 65.12%. In another research, the authors PPS Bedi et al. (2023) have employed NLP-based deep learning algorithms for text summary that perform well on linguistic text summarization data, and then modify/adapt these for biomedical domain-specific text summarization. This paper provides an approach developed in-house for condensing ill-punctuated or unpunctuated discussion transcripts into more intelligible summaries, which combines topic modelling and phrase selection with punctuation restorations. For autonomous synthesis of medical reports from biomedical transcripts, this research proposes using an end-to-end summarization technique, Deep Dense Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM), followed by convolutional neural network (CNN). The results reveal that models trained on ordinary language provide comparable results on a biomedical testing set, with one model outperforming the linguistic test set. This study emphasizes the application of a popular soft computing, meta-heuristic technique named genetic algorithm (GA) to solve an optimization problem for a software system. The next paper by Rajat Arora, Tandon, et al. (2023) presents a solution to the optimization problem using the GA tool in MATLAB. The results obtained have relevance in the industry for finding optimal values of significant variables before the release of newly developed software products to the ultimate client. The concept discussed in this paper has diverse applications in computer engineering, software and hardware industry. The next article by Anurag Choudhary et al. (2023) presents an intelligent fault diagnosis method based on the improved functionality of a convolutional neural network (CNN) through its hyperparameter optimization using a nature-inspired Artificial Bee Colony Optimization (ABCO) algorithm. The proposed diagnostic method introduces and analyses various possible mechanical and electrical faults in the IM. The obtained result indicates that the infrared thermography-based anomaly detection outperforms the vibration and acoustic-based diagnosis with 100% classification accuracy. The results signify the potential to diagnose different mechanical and electrical faults in IM with substantial reliability and robustness. The next article by Subhashree Rout et al. (2023) presents a hybrid approach called Siamese-HYNAA, which combines a Siamese network and a population-based optimizer hypercube natural aggregation algorithm (HYNAA) to generate candidate solutions for augmenting the minority class. The authors have evaluated the proposed strategy against basic SMOTE and SMOTE-PSOEV, using various performance measures, including ROC-AUC learning curves, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, characteristic stability index, balanced accuracy, F1-score, informedness, markedness and execution time. Our results indicate that Siamese-HYNAA generates promising results for imbalanced data. The next article by Dongmei Jin et al. (2023) aims to analyse the application value of magnetic resonance imaging based on Fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm in neonatal hypoglycaemia brain injury (HBI), and explore the risk factors related to the occurrence of brain injury in children, to provide guidance for clinical diagnosis and treatment. The results showed that the average minimum blood glucose (1.09 ± 0.53 mmoL/L) in the brain injury group was lower than that in the non-brain injury group (1.75 ± 0.49 mmoL/L), and the duration of hypoglycaemia (43.1 ± 21.07 h) was higher than that in the non-brain injury group (13.79 ± 6.81 h), p < 0.05. In conclusion, MRI images based on FCM clustering algorithm had higher image quality. Late first feeding time, low blood sugar level and long duration of hypoglycaemia were high risk factors for hypoglycaemic brain injury. The final article of this special issue by Mahmoud Ragab (2023) proposed a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm to facilitate the problem of feature selection for classification problems in machine learning. The proposed work is a binary hybrid of existing meta-heuristic algorithms, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the firefly algorithm (FA) such that it blends the best of each algorithm to provide an optimized and efficient way of solving the said problem. The suggested approach is assessed against six datasets from different domains that are publicly available at the UCI repository to demonstrate its validity. This approach has also been evaluated against similar such evolutionary-based approaches to prove its superiority. The hybrid firefly PSO algorithm is found to be suitable for feature selection problems. To conclude, this special issue publishes 13 papers out of a total of around 45 submitted papers. The guest editors hope that the research contributions and findings in this special issue would benefit the readers. We want to express our sincere thanks to the editor-in-chief for allowing us to organize this particular issue. The editorial office staffs are excellent, and we thank them for their support. We are also thankful to all the authors who made this special issue possible, and to the reviewers for their thoughtful contributions.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate how open access is reflected and implemented in all Norwegian universities and how they responded to national policy developments for open access in the period 2009–2021. We analyse how the universities adapted arguments for the three core missions of the universities–research, education, and societal impact–when they reacted to increasing pressures to facilitate open access. Our analysis is based on 182 institutional strategy documents, open access policies and annual reports. When considering the profile of the institutional policies and the explicit referrals to national policies, we find there is a great deal of homogeneity between Norwegian universities, and they are mostly aligned with national policy. Open access is connected to the third mission in all university strategies, but often in a very general manner and without documenting benefits for non-academic users. We find limited emphasis on open access as advantageous for education. All universities show commitment to open access, and several can be described as proactive as they tie it to different types of local incentives. Development over time suggests more mature and institutionalised polices that do not challenge what we may call the academic heartland and its core value of academic freedom, including where and how to publish. We propose a framework for analysing similar institutionalisation processes with three main dimensions: mimesis, adaptation/integration with existing practices, and maturation/commitment.

AB  - Scientific workflows consist of thousands of highly parallelized tasks executed in a distributed environment involving many components. Automatic tracing and investigation of the components' and tasks' performance metrics, traces, and behavior are necessary to support the end user with a level of abstraction since the large amount of data cannot be analyzed manually. The execution and monitoring of scientific workflows involves many components, the cluster infrastructure, its resource manager, the workflow, and the workflow tasks. All components in such an execution environment access different monitoring metrics and provide metrics on different abstraction levels. The combination and analysis of observed metrics from different components and their interdependencies are still widely unregarded. We specify four different monitoring layers that can serve as an architectural blueprint for the monitoring responsibilities and the interactions of components in the scientific workflow execution context. We describe the different monitoring metrics subject to the four layers and how the layers interact. Finally, we examine five state-of-the-art scientific workflow management systems (SWMS) in order to assess which steps are needed to enable our four-layer-based approach.

This has led to an increase in the multidisciplinarity of research products, but often also to a more specialized level of knowledge of the scholars. Therefore, while belonging to the same disciplinary field, scholars may present different working styles and willingness to collaborate according to their specific topics of interest. This plays a particularly relevant role in Italy, where tenured scholars in academic institutions are classified in sub-fields that, in turn, may be aggregated for purposes of recruitment and career advancement. Aim of this contribution is to propose a methodological approach to understand if the work and collaborative style of academic scholars belonging to different sub-fields is really so similar as to justify their grouping. For illustrative purposes, we focus on the co-authorship network of Italian academic statisticians relying on the database of scientific works published since 1990 until 2021 and downloaded by SCOPUS. From this database, we obtain a network composed of 758 nodes and 1730 edges. Some network measures at node level representing the work and collaborative style of scholars (i.e., number of publications, degree, degree strength, some centrality indices, transitivity, and external-internal index) are explained through quantile regression models. Results provide policy makers with useful insights on which sub-fields present significant differences in terms of research interests and collaborative style, thus not justifying their aggregation for recruitment and career advancement purposes.

AB  - Provenances are a research focus of neuroimaging resources sharing. An amount of work has been done to construct high-quality neuroimaging provenances in a standardized and convenient way. However, besides existing processed-based provenance extraction methods, open research sharing in computational neuroscience still needs one way to extract provenance information from rapidly growing published resources. This paper proposes a literature mining-based approach for research sharing-oriented neuroimaging provenance construction. A group of neuroimaging event-containing attributes are defined to model the whole process of neuroimaging researches, and a joint extraction model based on deep adversarial learning, called AT-NeuroEAE, is proposed to realize the event extraction in a few-shot learning scenario. Finally, a group of experiments were performed on the real data set from the journal PLOS ONE. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides a practical approach to quickly collect research information for neuroimaging provenance construction oriented to open research sharing.

AB  - This study seeks to show the distribution of academic studies relating to the keywords “artificial intelligence” and “aviation” by years, by authors, by countries, and by organizations using bibliometric data of scientific publications indexed in the Web of Science database between 2005-2023. In this direction, a total of 215 publications were analyzed and categorized in terms of bibliometric indicators by doing an online search on the Web of Science, and VOSviewer, a bibliometric analysis technique was used. As a result of the bibliometric analysis of 215 articles published with the keywords “artificial intelligence” and “aviation” between 2005 and 2023, it has been observed that significant developments have been recorded after 2014 and that the most broadcasts were made in 2022. In order to obtain healthier results and to avoid information pollution, some limitations were introduced to the analysis, such as "minimum number of publications" and "minimum number of citations". “People's Republic of China” is the country with the highest number of publications, with 98 articles in compliance with at least 6 publication conditions. The organization that published at least 4 articles with the keywords “artificial intelligence” and “aviation” became "Chinese Civil Aviation University" with 12 publications. The authors who have at least 4 publications in the articles made with the keywords “artificial intelligence” and “aviation” are "Pietro Aricò, Gianluca Borghini and Gianluca Di Flumeri" who have 10 publications.

AB  - The advent of data-driven science in the 21st century brought about the need for well-organized structured data and associated infrastructure able to facilitate the applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning. We present an effort aimed at organizing the diverse landscape of physics-based and data-driven computational models in order to facilitate the storage of associated information as structured data. We apply object-oriented design concepts and outline the foundations of an open-source collaborative framework that is (1) capable of uniquely describing the approaches in structured data, (2) flexible enough to cover the majority of widely used models, and (3) utilizes collective intelligence through community contributions. We present example database schemas and corresponding data structures and explain how these are deployed in software at the time of this writing.

AB  - Social media has become a useful instrument and forum for expressing worries about various difficulties and day-to-day concerns. The pertinent postings containing people’s complaints about water quality as an additional source of information can be automatically acquired/retrieved and analyzed using natural language processing and machine learning approaches. In this paper, we search social media for a water quality analysis and propose a scalable messaging system for quality-related issues to the subscribers. We classify the WaterQualityTweets dataset, our newly collected collection, in two phases. In the first phase, tweets are classified into two classes (water quality-related or not). In the second phase, water quality-related issues are classified into four classes (color, illness, odor/taste, and unusual state). The best performance results are BERT and CNN, respectively, for binary and multi-class classification. Also, these issues are sent to different subscribers via a topic-based system with their location and timing information. Depending on the topics that online users are interested in, some information spreads faster than others. In our dataset, we also predict the information diffusion to understand water quality issues’ spreading. The time and effort required for manual comments obtained through crowd-sourcing techniques will significantly decline as a result of this automatic analysis of water quality issues.

AB  - Abstract Scientists collaborate through intricate networks, which impact the quality and scope of their research. At the same time, funding and institutional arrangements, as well as scientific and political cultures, affect the structure of collaboration networks. Since such arrangements and cultures differ across regions in the world in systematic ways, we surmise that collaboration networks and impact should also differ systematically across regions. To test this, we compare the structure of collaboration networks among prominent researchers in North America and Europe. We find that prominent researchers in Europe establish denser collaboration networks, whereas those in North America establish more decentralized networks. We also find that the impact of the publications of prominent researchers in North America is significantly higher than for those in Europe, both when they collaborate with other prominent researchers and when they do not. Although Europeans collaborate with other prominent researchers more often, which increases their impact, we also find that repeated collaboration among prominent researchers decreases the synergistic effect of collaborating.

AB  - Decision making by software systems that face uncertainty needs tracing to support understandability, as accountability is crucial. While logging has been essential to support explanations and understandability of behaviour, several issues still persist, such as the high cost for managing large logs, not knowing what to log, and the inability of logging techniques to relate events to each other or to specific occurrences of high-level activities in the system. Cronista is an alternative to logging for systems that act on top of runtime models. Instead of targeting the running systems, Cronista automatically collects the provenance of changes made to the runtime models, which aim at leveraging high-level representations, to produce more concise historical records. The provenance graphs capture causal links between those changes and the activities of the system, which are used to investigate issues. Cronista’s architecture is described with the current design and the implementation of its high-level components for single-machine, multi-threaded systems. Cronista is applied to a traffic-simulation case study. The trade-offs of two different storage solutions are evaluated, i.e. the CDO model repositories, and JanusGraph graph databases. Integrating Cronista into the case study requires only minor code changes. Cronista collected provenance graphs for the simulations as they ran, using both CDO and JanusGraph. Both solutions highlighted the cause of a seeded defect in the system. For the longer executions, both CDO and JanusGraph showed negligible overhead on the simulation times. Querying and visualisation tools were more user-friendly in JanusGraph than in CDO. Cronista demonstrates the feasibility of recording fine-grained provenance for the evolution of runtime models, while using it to investigate issues. User convenience and resource requirements need to be balanced. The paper present how the available technologies studied offer different trade-offs to satisfy the balance required.

AB  - Some scientific studies involve huge amounts of bioinformatics data that cannot be analyzed on personal computers usually employed by researchers for day-to-day activities but rather necessitate effective computational infrastructures that can work in a distributed way. For this purpose, distributed computing systems have become useful tools to analyze large amounts of bioinformatics data and to generate relevant results on virtual environments, where software can be executed for hours or even days without affecting the personal computer or laptop of a researcher. Even if distributed computing resources have become pivotal in multiple bioinformatics laboratories, often researchers and students use them in the wrong ways, making mistakes that can cause the distributed computers to underperform or that can even generate wrong outcomes. In this context, we present here ten quick tips for the usage of Apache Spark distributed computing systems for bioinformatics analyses: ten simple guidelines that, if taken into account, can help users avoid common mistakes and can help them run their bioinformatics analyses smoothly. Even if we designed our recommendations for beginners and students, they should be followed by experts too. We think our quick tips can help anyone make use of Apache Spark distributed computing systems more efficiently and ultimately help generate better, more reliable scientific results.

AB  - In science, sleeping beauties (SBs) denotes a special phenomenon of the diffusion of scientific knowledge based on citation trajectories, the awakening of which is also measured through changes in the citations index. However, the rapid advancement of social media has altered the mode of scientific communication and knowledge diffusion. This study aims to re-identify SBs and its Prince from the perspective of comprehensive indicators, which involves the analysis of Altmetrics indexes and Citation index, and investigate the awakening mechanism of A-SB to supplement the research on the awakening mechanism of SBs. By combining Ab index, we redefined the Prince, which makes A-SB receive high attention after a long Sleeping period and reflects the most prominent academic or social behavior that awakens and sustains the Awakening of A-SB. Then we conducted empirical research on the retrieved PLOS Biology collection and examined Prince after identifying the A-SB. The analysis and summary of the characteristics of the identified A-SB and Prince revealed the SBs’ awakening mechanism under the comprehensive trajectory based on Altmetrics from the three dimensions of the influence between the indicators, the overall evolution trajectory of A-SB, and literature bibliometric attributes. In the trajectory of Delayed Recognition stage of A-SB, we define the Dogsleep of SBs, which mirrors that the instability of the Sleeping of SBs will generate a specific negative impact on Prince of A-SB and Awakening intensity. Besides, the literature bibliometric attributes cannot reflect the tendency of users to read academic papers, which again proves that the traditional citation index cannot be neglected in the awakening mechanism of A-SB. Overall, this study demonstrates the addition of the Altmetrics indexes as a useful complement, illustrating the inheritance and connection between the SBs based on the comprehensive trajectory and the SBs based on the citation diffusion trajectory.

AB  - With the recent growth of the Internet, the volume of data has also increased. In particular, the increase in the amount of unstructured data makes it difficult to manage data. Classification is also needed in order to be able to use the data for various purposes. Since it is difficult to manually classify the ever-increasing volume data for the purpose of various types of analysis and evaluation, automatic classification methods are needed. In addition, the performance of imbalanced and multi-class classification is a challenging task. As the number of classes increases, so does the number of decision boundaries a learning algorithm has to solve. Therefore, in this paper, an improvement model is proposed using WordNet lexical ontology and BERT to perform deeper learning on the features of text, thereby improving the classification effect of the model. It was observed that classification success increased when using WordNet 11 general lexicographer files based on synthesis sets, syntactic categories, and logical groupings. WordNet was used for feature dimension reduction. In experimental studies, word embedding methods were used without dimension reduction. Afterwards, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithms were employed to perform classification. These studies were then repeated with dimension reduction performed by WordNet. In addition to the machine learning model, experiments were also conducted with the pretrained BERT model with and without WordNet. The experimental results showed that, on an unstructured, seven-class, imbalanced dataset, the highest accuracy value of 93.77% was obtained when using our proposed model.

AB  - Data curation has significant research implications irrespective of application areas. As most curated studies rely on databases for data extraction, the availability of data resources is extremely important. Taking a perspective from pharmacology, extracted data contribute to improved drug treatment outcomes and well-being but with some challenges. Considering available pharmacology literature, it is necessary to review articles and other scientific documents carefully. A typical method of accessing articles on journal websites is through long-established searches. In addition to being labor-intensive, this conventional approach often leads to incomplete-content downloads. This paper presents a new methodology with user-friendly models to accept search keywords according to the investigators’ research fields for metadata and full-text articles. To accomplish this, scientifically published records on the pharmacokinetics of drugs were extracted from several sources using our navigating tool called the Web Crawler for Pharmacokinetics (WCPK). The results of metadata extraction provided 74,867 publications for four drug classes. Full-text extractions performed with WCPK revealed that the system is highly competent, extracting over 97% of records. This model helps establish keyword-based article repositories, contributing to comprehensive databases for article curation projects. This paper also explains the procedures adopted to build the proposed customizable-live WCPK, from system design and development to deployment phases.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a hybrid system for contextual and semantic indexing of Arabic documents, bringing an improvement to classical models based on n-grams and the Okapi model. This new approach takes into account the concept of the semantic vicinity of terms. We proceed in fact by the calculation of similarity between words using an hybridization of NGRAMs-OKAPI statistical measures and a kernel function in order to identify relevant descriptors. Terminological resources such as graphs and semantic dictionaries are integrated into the system to improve the indexing and the classification processes.

AB  - The Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) together with the Electronic Library eLibrary.ru has proposed an Academic rating of scientific journals from a limited collection, which includes about 700 journals. Using the example of a rating of journals compiled by the impact factor in the thematic section “Mathematics”, the methodological errors made in the selection of the reference group of journals are shown. It is concluded that the Academic rating has significant distortions associated with the thematic heterogeneity (multidisciplinary) of journals in reference groups formed on the basis of the existing classifier. The rating indicators are influenced by articles that are not related to the topic of the rating. We believe that an alternative technology for forming reference groups “from the bottom up” is a more reliable basis for thematic ratings. The bottom-up technology reveals the thematic proximity of journal articles based on the analysis of their bibliographic references, launching the clustering process. The thematic proximity of journals can be expressed in numerical form and further serve as the basis for the formation of reference groups for the thematic rating. A carefully constructed reference group is the key to the adequacy of the thematic rating of journals.

AB  - Science is an engine of innovation and economic growth and a pathway to prosperity for countries around the world.The increasing availability of scientific publications today poses a data-driven opportunity to better understand and improve science.Scientific publications contain data on the content of published research and metadata on the context that gave rise to that research.Here we discuss and demonstrate the power of constructing, archiving, and analyzing links between scientific data and metadata to construct massive computational observatories of and for modern science.We show how these can be constructed using modern graph databases, and suggest some methods of analysis with potential to unleash sustained value for science and society.These scientific observatories would allow us to diagnose the health of the scientific workforce and institutions, and track the rate of scientific advance.They could enable us to better guide science policy and build portfolios of supported research that balance our societal commitments to diverse participation and prosperity.Moreover, they could enable scientists to surf the deluge of published research to open the scientific frontier in directions that do not follow the current, but open up new views and opportunities for others to follow.Linked scientific data can also enable the construction of artificial intelligence agents designed to complement the disciplinary focus of human scientific attention by proposing possibilities overlooked or underfunded by contemporary scientific institutions.Finally, we argue for the importance of ongoing political and legal support for the promotion of open, linked data to facilitate widespread benefit.

AB  - The selection of the research area is very vital for new researchers. One of the major issues for researchers is the selection of the domain of research on which he/she can carry out research. This case is very vital on the grounds that it decides the future of the researchers in that research area. Finding hot and attractive research areas is not considered in the relevant literature of Scientometrics. In this regard, the correct decision of the selection of the research domain helps the researchers to show better performance as well gain a good academic career. The main aim of this research study is to figure out the attractive research areas for the researchers, especially who are at the starting stage of their research life. To the best of our knowledge, this research area is still very limited due to limited work done in this area. So in order to distinguish the attractive research field for the new researchers, new rising fields are identified by applying the well-known g-index, which is widely used for finding the top authors in academic networks. In addition, we compute diverse, relevant features of the research fields which help us to identify top research area. The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is capable to recommend the attractive research fields for potential future research work. An extensive empirical analysis has been carried out using the widely used academic database of DBLP.

AB  - Although “a picture is worth a thousand words,” this may not be enough to get your post seen on social media. This study’s main objective was to determine the best ways to characterize a photo in terms of viral marketing and public appealing. We have to obtain this dataset for this reason from the social media site such as Instagram. A total of 1.4 million hashtags were used in the 570,000 photos that we crawled. Prior to training the text generation module to produce such popular hashtags, we had to determine the components and features of the photo. We trained a multilabel image classification module using a ResNet neural network model for the first section. In order to create hashtags pertaining to their popularity, we trained a cutting-edge GPT-2 language model for the second portion. This work differs from others in that, and it initially offered a cutting-edge GPT-2 model for hashtag generation using a combination of the multilabel image classification module. The popularity issues and ways to make an Instagram post popular are also highlighted in our essay. Social science and marketing research can both be conducted on this subject. Which content can be considered popular from the perspective of consumers can be researched in the social science setting. As a marketing strategy, end users can help by offering such well-liked hashtags for social media accounts. This essay adds to the body of knowledge by demonstrating the two possible uses of popularity. Compared to the base model, our popular hashtag generating algorithm creates 11% more relevant, acceptable, and trending hashtags, according to the evaluation that was carried out.

AB  - The Lernmatrix is a classic associative memory model. The Lernmatrix is capable of executing the pattern classification task, but its performance is not competitive when compared to state-of-the-art classifiers. The main contribution of this paper consists of the proposal of a simple mathematical transform, whose application eliminates the subtractive alterations between patterns. As a consequence, the Lernmatrix performance is significantly improved. To perform the experiments, we selected 20 datasets that are challenging for any classifier, as they exhibit class imbalance. The effectiveness of our proposal was compared against seven supervised classifiers of the most important approaches (Bayes, nearest neighbors, decision trees, logistic function, support vector machines, and neural networks). By choosing balanced accuracy as a performance measure, our proposal obtained the best results in 10 datasets. The elimination of subtractive alterations makes the new model competitive against the best classifiers, and sometimes beats them. After applying the Friedman test and the Holm post hoc test, we can conclude that within a 95% confidence, our proposal competes successfully with the most effective classifiers of the state of the art.

AB  - There is a massive growth of text documents on the web. This led to the increasing need for methods that can organize and classify electronic documents (instances) automati-cally. Multi-label classification task is widely used in real-world problems and it has been applied on di˙erent applications. It assigns multiple labels for each document simultaneously. Few and insuÿcient research studies have investigated the multi-label text classification problem in the Arabic language. Therefore, this survey paper aims to present an extensive review of the existing multi-label classification methods and techniques that can deal with multi-label problem. Besides, we focus on Arabic language by covering the relevant applications of multi-label classification on the Arabic text, and identify the main challenges faced by these studies. Furthermore, this survey presents an experimental comparisons of di˙erent multi-label classification methods applied for the Arabic context and points out some baseline results. We found that further investigations are also needed to improve the multi-label classification task in the Arabic language, especially the hierarchical classification task.

AB  - The science and technology (S&T) cycle starts with Congress identifying areas that demand scientific advancements.The cycle continues with funding agencies distributing funds to researchers to investigate and advance these areas.These novel advancements are then reported in scholarly publications.Scientific advancements are ultimately expected to be converted into wealth, promoting economic activity, and benefiting society.It is not, however, guaranteed that the desired advances targeted by Congress are met.Scholarly publications encompass valuable knowledge about many aspects of the S&T cycle and may retain the key to many unanswered questions and support multiple, yet unoffered, services to users.Because of the data deluge, it has become necessary to rely on automated decision-making agents based on artificial intelligence (AI) methods to make decisions.This article introduces AI and proposes to relieve highly-specialized human experts from the position of decision makers and shift them to become managers of automated decision-making agents that can handle the data volume.This article will lay out research directions, technical challenges, and the benefits of applying AI in various steps of the S&T cycle.

AB  - Abstract One of the key channels of scholarly knowledge exchange are scholarly events such as conferences, workshops, symposiums, etc.; such events are especially important and popular in Computer Science, Engineering, and Natural Sciences. However, scholars encounter problems in finding relevant information about upcoming events and statistics on their historic evolution. In order to obtain a better understanding of scholarly event characteristics in four fields of science, we analyzed the metadata of scholarly events of four major fields of science, namely Computer Science, Physics, Engineering, and Mathematics using Scholarly Events Quality Assessment suite, a suite of ten metrics. In particular, we analyzed renowned scholarly events belonging to five sub-fields within Computer Science, namely World Wide Web, Computer Vision, Software Engineering, Data Management, as well as Security and Privacy. This analysis is based on a systematic approach using descriptive statistics as well as exploratory data analysis. The findings are on the one hand interesting to observe the general evolution and success factors of scholarly events; on the other hand, they allow (prospective) event organizers, publishers, and committee members to assess the progress of their event over time and compare it to other events in the same field; and finally, they help researchers to make more informed decisions when selecting suitable venues for presenting their work. Based on these findings, a set of recommendations has been concluded to different stakeholders, involving event organizers, potential authors, proceedings publishers, and sponsors. Our comprehensive dataset of scholarly events of the aforementioned fields is openly available in a semantic format and maintained collaboratively at OpenResearch.org .

AB  - Abstract This article relies on the analysis of social networks to compare the networks at work in the composition of thesis committees between 2003 and 2008 in a French provincial university in three very different disciplines (astrophysics, archaeology, and economics) so as to test the hypothesis that connections actually existed before graduation. Were members coauthors of scientific publications or were committees constituted only for the sake of awarding a PhD? Astrophysics and its “equipment” ethos is the one that most often superimposes committee membership and copublishing. Archaeology falls somewhere in between, due to the greatest scarcity of committee members. The last of the three, economics, actually separates the two types of collaboration by most frequently inviting international researchers.

AB  - Hadith judgment implies checking the validity of Hadith to decide whether it is correct (trustworthy) or false (bogus). “Matn” and “Isnad” are the main constituents of Hadith; “Matn” is the sayings of the prophet, whereas “Isnad” represents the narrators’ series. The first step of Hadith judgment is the extraction of narrators’ names, after that, the rules of judgment, which were set out by Hadith’s scientists, could be implemented, three of these rules are particularly related to the narrators’ series, and these rules are continuity of the transmission chain, the trustworthiness of the narrators, and the preciseness of the narrators. Therefore, to check the authenticity of Hadiths, the three conditions must be satisfied, and to do so, the narrators’ names must be extracted first. Isnad contains many words and phrases called “Isnad-Phrases”; these phrases have many types or categories called part of Isnads (POIs) like Narrator-Name, Prophet-Name, and Received-Method. A lot of computational research studies suggest serving Hadith sciences by extracting the narrators’ names and other POIs using various approaches. This study presents a new hybrid approach founded on the hidden Markov model (HMM) and gazetteer lists to process “Isnad.” The approach objective is to expect all POIs in the Isnad including narrators’ names. The experiments carried on 1,000 Hadiths from “Sahih Muslim”: 900 Hadiths as training dataset and 100 Hadiths as testing dataset, and the results show a noteworthy accuracy for the proposed hybrid approach.

AB  - The number of received citations and more complex bibliographic measures calculated based on them, such as the h-index, remain the most widely used indicators for measuring research impact in an objective and easy-to-compute way. However, using the number of received citations as a research impact measure has its shortcomings, some intrinsic (stemming from the doubt whether a citation is actually a confirmation of the cited paper’s impact), some extrinsic (stemming from the ease of manipulating this measure by deliberately inserting multiple unmerited references). While the first can only be addressed by a careful interpretation of the measure with consideration of its limitations, the latter can be reduced to much extent by replacing simple citation counting with a more sophisticated procedure constraining the impact that a single publication may have on the others. One such solution is ArticleRank, which has, however, several disadvantages limiting its practical use. In this paper, we propose another solution to this problem, the Transitive Research Impact Score (TRIS), which is free of these disadvantages, and validate it on a sample dataset.

AB  - We present an eight-year curriculum redesign effort impacting al-most every course in our computer science department. Having not made a major update to our curriculum in two decades, complications began to arise from significant increases in enrollment and instituting multiple degrees in computing in the same department. Starting from a desire to adjust a few courses, we systematically collected a broad set of requirements and blue-sky ideas from many stakeholders, resulting in an unsatisfiable set of content, ordering, and course boundary constraints. After multiple rounds of conversation with our stakeholders in and out of the department, we evolved and relaxed several of our constraints, allowing us to develop a compromise plan for seven new courses and a new prerequisite system. We then piloted five of the new courses and collected feedback on results, iterating on these courses each semester for two years. We worked with registrars, advisors, and administrators to develop a transition plan from old to new courses. This paper presents highlights of each step of this process, a summary of the resulting curriculum design, and reflections and recommendations for other departments that may want to undertake a similar update.

AB  - Few-Shot Text Classification (FSTC) imitates humans to learn a new text classifier efficiently with only few examples, by leveraging prior knowledge from historical tasks. However, most prior works assume that all the tasks are sampled from a single data source, which cannot adapt to real-world scenarios where tasks are heterogeneous and lie in different distributions. As such, existing methods may suffer from their globally knowledge-shared mechanisms to handle the task heterogeneity. On the other hand, inherent task relationships are not explicitly captured, making task knowledge unorganized and hard to transfer to new tasks. Thus, we explore a new FSTC setting where tasks can come from a diverse range of data sources. To address the task heterogeneity, we propose a self-supervised hierarchical task clustering (SS-HTC) method. SS-HTC not only customizes the cluster-specific knowledge by dynamically organizing heterogeneous tasks into different clusters in hierarchical levels but also disentangles the underlying relations between tasks to improve the interpretability. Empirically, extensive experiments on five public FSTC benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SS-HTC.

AB  - Abstract The present paper explores the relationship between highly intercited papers in the k -max of citation networks and an author’s impact from the Mexican National System of Researchers (SNI). We investigate whether a more interconnected network, a higher k of the k -max, explains the variation of the total number of citations, controlling for personal characteristics such as SNI level, area of expertise, and the number of publications. We find that the k -max is positively and significantly correlated with impact. In this context, we find that the share of self and collaborator-citations increases with the magnitude of the k -max and women tend to have less interlinked cores of their citation networks than men (smaller k ’s). Interestingly, we find that women tend to have a higher share of third-party citations while men tend to have a higher share of self and collaborator-citations, for all k ’s and areas of expertise. We conduct a Blinder–Oaxaca decomposition to better understand the citation gender gap and find that much of it can be explained through the differences in observable characteristics (including the k -max) between women and men.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to analyze the use of Google Scholar Citations’ profiling platform by library and information science (LIS) scholars in Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach Purposive sampling was used to collect Google Scholar Citations profiles between 15 November 2017 and 31 January 2018. Resultant data were analyzed in SPSS Version 21. Findings In terms of demographical data, the study results were consistent with previous studies of Pakistani LIS scholars. There were strong correlations between Google Scholar Citations metrics (publications, citations, h-index and i10-index). The results indicate that, compared with a 2011 survey of LIS academics in Pakistan, the overall uptake for this cohort remains relatively low. This cohort is not maximizing the opportunity provided by this specific online profiling system to increase research visibility. Research limitations/implications As the study was limited to those Pakistani LIS scholars who already had a profile on ResearchGate, it would be useful to broaden the research to encompass all Pakistani LIS scholars. Practical implications The role of the librarian as an adviser in scholarly communication and impact can be extended to support scholars in the adoption of new online platforms for scholarly communication and visibility. Originality/value There have been no published research studies on Google Scholar Citations metrics in the context of Pakistani LIS scholars as a whole.

AB  - Hierarchical multi-label text classification (HMTC) aims at utilizing a label hierarchy in multi-label classification. Recent approaches to HMTC deal with the problem of imposing an overconstrained premise on the output space by using contrastive learning on generated samples in a semi-supervised manner to bring text and label embeddings closer. However, the generation of samples tends to introduce noise as it ignores the correlation between similar samples in the same batch. One solution to this issue is supervised contrastive learning, but it remains an underexplored topic in HMTC due to its complex structured labels. To overcome this challenge, we propose **HJCL**, a **H**ierarchy-aware **J**oint Supervised **C**ontrastive **L**earning method that bridges the gap between supervised contrastive learning and HMTC. Specifically, we employ both instance-wise and label-wise contrastive learning techniques and carefully construct batches to fulfill the contrastive learning objective. Extensive experiments on four multi-path HMTC datasets demonstrate that HJCLachieves promising results and the effectiveness of Contrastive Learning on HMTC. Code and data are available at https://github.com/simonucl/HJCL.

AB  - This study analyzes the implementation of open science in Spanish universities considering four perspectives: (i) regulations, policies, and strategies; (ii) knowledge production; (iii) research results; and (iv) perception by different academic actors. A qualitative and quantitative methodology is applied, drawing information from university websites, institutional reports, European project databases (Cordis), the Web of Science database, surveys of teaching and research staff, and surveys of vice-rectors and library directors. The information is grouped into regional university systems, according to the autonomous community to which each university belongs, and is analyzed on that basis. The results of the quantitative study show increasing interest in open-science activities, expressed as a growing number of publications, and an increase in participation, leadership, and funding in European projects. Institutional policies and regulations on open science, on the other hand, are few and focus almost exclusively on open access. The development of institutional repositories is one of the great achievements of the Spanish university system, and open-access publishing (mainly green open access) has grown considerably in the last decade. Teaching and research staff are not knowledgeable about open science, although in general they take a positive view toward it, while university policymakers report that most actions to promote open science are still in the process of being implemented. The results reveal heterogeneity among the various institutions’ practices and implementation. As a regional system, the Catalonian university system stands out above the rest for its degree of open-science policy development and implementation and for its intense research activity in the field of open science.

AB  - Abstract Background Scientific publications are meant to exchange knowledge among researchers but the inability to properly reproduce computational experiments limits the quality of scientific research. Furthermore, bibliography shows that irreproducible preclinical research exceeds 50%, which produces a huge waste of resources on nonprofitable research at Life Sciences field. As a consequence, scientific reproducibility is being fostered to promote Open Science through open databases and software tools that are typically deployed on existing computational resources. However, some computational experiments require complex virtual infrastructures, such as elastic clusters of PCs, that can be dynamically provided from multiple clouds. Obtaining these infrastructures requires not only an infrastructure provider, but also advanced knowledge in the cloud computing field. Objectives The main aim of this paper is to improve reproducibility in life sciences to produce better and more cost-effective research. For that purpose, our intention is to simplify the infrastructure usage and deployment for researchers. Methods This paper introduces Advanced Platform for Reproducible Infrastructures in the Cloud via Open Tools (APRICOT), an open source extension for Jupyter to deploy deterministic virtual infrastructures across multiclouds for reproducible scientific computational experiments. To exemplify its utilization and how APRICOT can improve the reproduction of experiments with complex computation requirements, two examples in the field of life sciences are provided. All requirements to reproduce both experiments are disclosed within APRICOT and, therefore, can be reproduced by the users. Results To show the capabilities of APRICOT, we have processed a real magnetic resonance image to accurately characterize a prostate cancer using a Message Passing Interface cluster deployed automatically with APRICOT. In addition, the second example shows how APRICOT scales the deployed infrastructure, according to the workload, using a batch cluster. This example consists of a multiparametric study of a positron emission tomography image reconstruction. Conclusion APRICOT's benefits are the integration of specific infrastructure deployment, the management and usage for Open Science, making experiments that involve specific computational infrastructures reproducible. All the experiment steps and details can be documented at the same Jupyter notebook which includes infrastructure specifications, data storage, experimentation execution, results gathering, and infrastructure termination. Thus, distributing the experimentation notebook and needed data should be enough to reproduce the experiment.

AB  - Modeling business processes as a set of activities to accomplish goals naturally makes them be executed several times. Usually, such executions produce a large portion of provenance data in different formats such as text, audio, and video. Such a multiple-type nature gives origin to multimodal provenance data. Analyzing multimodal provenance data in an integrated form may be complex and error-prone when manually performed as it requires extracting information from free-text, audio, and video files. However, such an analysis may generate valuable insights into the business process. The present article presents MINERVA (Multimodal busINEss pRoVenance Analysis). This approach focuses on identifying improvements that can be implemented in business processes, as well as in collaboration analysis using multimodal provenance data. MINERVA was evaluated through a feasibility study that used data from a consulting company.

In marking the 20th anniversary year of Socio-Economic Review (SER), this article examines the role of gender among authors and reviewers in SER. Our findings show that women remain underrepresented in terms of authorship and reviewing. While no gender differences exist in overall acceptance rates for submitted papers, a substantial gender gap exists in the number of submissions. Our analysis also highlights how the persistence of gender segregation is related to the predominance of male-only author teams and male-dominated research topics. The article concludes with suggestions for further research and a discussion on gender disparities in socio-economics and other social science fields.

AB  - The creation or title changes of scientific journals in the information and documentation (ID) area in the period 2013-2018 are analyzed. Based on the total of 62 such journals identified through ISSN Portal and Ulrichsweb, the following are described: characteristic aspects such as country, language, type of publisher, and access model; presence in bibliographic databases, citations, or journal directories; survival and volume of articles published; annual number of citations to articles according to Google Scholar; thematic scope declared by the editors; and finally, the justification given by the editors for the change of title or the creation of a new journal. Among the main conclusions regarding newly created titles, the leading role of academic publishers in expanding national university systems and open-access titles stands out. In general, new publications generate few articles per year, have little presence in databases, and receive few citations. Title changes were found only in journals published by commercial publishers. In both cases, journals with a general thematic scope predominate and a significant number of journals did not justify their creation or change of title. Abstract Se analiza la creación o cambios de título de las revistas científicas del área de Información y Documentación (ID) en el periodo de 2013-2018. A partir de un total de 62 revistas identificadas a través de ISSN Portal y Ulrichsweb se describen: aspectos característicos como países, idiomas, tipos de editor y modelo de acceso; la difusión en bases de datos bibliográficas, de citas o directorios de revistas; la pervivencia y el volumen de producción de artículos; número de citas anual de los artículos en Google Scholar; alcance temático que declaran los editores; y finalmente, la justificación que los editores exponen en el cambio de título o en la creación de una nueva revista. Como conclusiones principales respecto a los títulos de nueva creación, destaca el protagonismo de los editores académicos de sistemas universitarios nacionales en expansión y de los títulos en acceso abierto. En general las nuevas publicaciones generan pocos artículos por año, tienen poca presencia en bases de datos y reciben pocas citas. Los cambios de títulos se detectan sólo en editoriales comerciales. En ambos casos predominan las revistas de alcance temático general y un número importante de revistas no justifica su creación o el cambio de título.

AB  - In recent years, many software engineering researchers have begun to include artifacts alongside their research papers. Ideally, artifacts, including tools, benchmarks, and data, support the dissemination of ideas, provide evidence for research claims, and serve as a starting point for future research. However, in practice, artifacts suffer from a variety of issues that prevent the realization of their full potential. To help the software engineering community realize the full potential of artifacts, we seek to understand the challenges involved in the creation, sharing, and use of artifacts. To that end, we perform a mixed-methods study including a survey of artifacts in software engineering publications, and an online survey of 153 software engineering researchers. By analyzing the perspectives of artifact creators, users, and reviewers, we identify several high-level challenges that affect the quality of artifacts including mismatched expectations between these groups, and a lack of sufficient reward for both creators and reviewers. Using Diffusion of Innovations as an analytical framework, we examine how these challenges relate to one another, and build an understanding of the factors that affect the sharing and success of artifacts. Finally, we make recommendations to improve the quality of artifacts based on our results and existing best practices.

AB  - Sentiment analysis (SA) is an area of study currently being investigated in text mining. SA is the computational handling of a text’s views, emotions, subjectivity, and subjective nature. The researchers realized that generating generic sentiment from textual material was inadequate, so they developed SA to extract expressions from textual information. The problem of removing emotional aspects through multi-labeling based on data from certain aspects may be resolved. This article proposes the swarm-based hybrid model residual networks with sand cat swarm optimization (ResNet-SCSO), a novel method for increasing the precision and variation of learning the text with the multi-labeling method. Contrary to existing multi-label training approaches, ResNet-SCSO highlights the diversity and accuracy of methodologies based on multi-labeling. Five distinct datasets were analyzed (movies, research articles, medical, birds, and proteins). To achieve accurate and improved data, we initially used preprocessing. Secondly, we used the GloVe and TF-IDF to extract features. Thirdly, a word association is created using the word2vec method. Additionally, the enhanced data are utilized for training and validating the ResNet model (tuned with SCSO). We tested the accuracy of ResNet-SCSO on research article, medical, birds, movie, and protein images using the aspect-based multi-labeling method. The accuracy was 95%, 96%, 97%, 92%, and 96%, respectively. With multi-label datasets of varying dimensions, our proposed model shows that ResNet-SCSO is significantly better than other commonly used techniques. Experimental findings confirm the implemented strategy’s success compared to existing benchmark methods.

AB  - With the advent of the big data era and the rapid development of the Internet industry, the information processing technology of text mining has become an indispensable role in natural language processing. In our daily life, many things cannot be separated from natural language processing technology, such as machine translation, intelligent response, and semantic search. At the same time, with the development of artificial intelligence, text mining technology has gradually developed into a research hotspot. There are many ways to realize text mining. This paper mainly describes the realization of web text mining and the realization of text structure algorithm based on HTML through a variety of methods to compare the specific clustering time of web text mining. Through this comparison, we can also get which web mining is the most efficient. The use of WebKB datasets for many times in experimental comparison also reflects that Web text mining for the Chinese language logic intelligent detection algorithm provides a basis.

AB  - The growth of digital correspondence documents with various types, different naming rules, and no sufficient search system complicates the search process with certain content, especially if there are unclassified documents, the search becomes inaccurate and takes a long time. This research proposed archiving method with automatic hierarchical classification and the content-based search method which displays ontology classification information as the solution to the content-based search problems. The method consists of preprocessing (creation of automatic hierarchical classification model using a combination of convolutional neural network (CNN) and regular expression method), archiving (document archiving with automatic classification), and retrieval (content-based search by displaying ontology relationships from the document classification). The archiving of 100 documents using the automatic hierarchical classification was found to be 79% accurate as indicated by the 99% accuracy for CNN and 80% for Regex. Moreover, the search results for classified content-based documents through the display of ontology relationships were discovered to be 100% accurate. This research succeeded in improving the quality of search results for digital correspondence documents as indicated by its higher specificity, accuracy, and speed compared to conventional methods based on file names, annotations, and unclassified content.

AB  - Collaboration is a key driver of science and innovation. Mainly motivated by the need to leverage different capacities and expertise to solve a scientific problem, collaboration is also an excellent source of information about the future behavior of scholars. In particular, it allows us to infer the likelihood that scientists choose future research directions via the intertwined mechanisms of selection and social influence. Here we thoroughly investigate the interplay between collaboration and topic switches. We find that the probability for a scholar to start working on a new topic increases with the number of previous collaborators, with a pattern showing that the effects of individual collaborators are not independent. The higher the productivity and the impact of authors, the more likely their coworkers will start working on new topics. The average number of coauthors per paper is also inversely related to the topic switch probability, suggesting a dilution of this effect as the number of collaborators increases.

AB  - Reproducible research and open science practices have the potential to accelerate scientific progress by allowing others to reuse research outputs, and by promoting rigorous research that is more likely to yield trustworthy results. However, these practices are uncommon in many fields, so there is a clear need for training that helps and encourages researchers to integrate reproducible research and open science practices into their daily work. Here, we outline eleven strategies for making training in these practices the norm at research institutions. The strategies, which emerged from a virtual brainstorming event organized in collaboration with the German Reproducibility Network, are concentrated in three areas: (i) adapting research assessment criteria and program requirements; (ii) training; (iii) building communities. We provide a brief overview of each strategy, offer tips for implementation, and provide links to resources. We also highlight the importance of allocating resources and monitoring impact. Our goal is to encourage researchers – in their roles as scientists, supervisors, mentors, instructors, and members of curriculum, hiring or evaluation committees – to think creatively about the many ways they can promote reproducible research and open science practices in their institutions.

AB  - News classification plays a vital role in newsrooms, as it involves the time-consuming task of categorizing news articles and requires domain knowledge. Effective news classification is essential for categorizing and organizing a constant flow of information, serving as the foundation for subsequent tasks, such as news aggregation, monitoring, filtering, and organization. Automation of this process can significantly benefit newsrooms by saving time and resources. In this study, we explore the potential of the GPT large language model in a zero-shot setting for multi-class classification of news articles within the widely accepted International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC) news ontology. The IPTC news ontology provides a structured framework for categorizing news, facilitating the efficient organization and retrieval of news content. By investigating the effectiveness of the GPT language model in this classification task, we aimed to understand its capabilities and potential applications in the news domain. This study was conducted as part of our ongoing research in the field of automated journalism.

AB  - The exploitation of potential societal benefits of Earth observations is hampered by users having to engage in often tedious processes to discover data and extract information and knowledge. A concept is introduced for a transition from the current perception of data as passive objects (DPO) to a new perception of data as active subjects (DAS). This transition would greatly increase data usage and exploitation, and support the extraction of knowledge from data products. Enabling the data subjects to actively reach out to potential users would revolutionize data dissemination and sharing and facilitate collaboration in user communities. The three core elements of the transformative DAS concept are: (1) “intelligent semantic data agents” (ISDAs) that have the capabilities to communicate with their human and digital environment. Each ISDA provides a voice to the data product it represents. It has comprehensive knowledge of the represented product including quality, uncertainties, access conditions, previous uses, user feedbacks, etc., and it can engage in transactions with users. (2) A knowledge base that constructs extensive graphs presenting a comprehensive picture of communities of people, applications, models, tools, and resources and provides tools for the analysis of these graphs. (3) An interaction platform that links the ISDAs to the human environment and facilitates transaction including discovery of products, access to products and derived knowledge, modifications and use of products, and the exchange of feedback on the usage. This platform documents the transactions in a secure way maintaining full provenance.

AB  - Abstract We explore the role of organizational factors in research collaboration networks among European universities. The study of organizational drivers in shaping collaboration patterns is crucial for policy design aimed at reducing research fragmentation and fostering knowledge creation and diffusion. By using Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) and controlling for spatial factors, we investigate the role of two main mechanisms guiding the partners’ selection process: organizational attributes and homophily. We investigate two distinct scientific collaboration networks (i.e., projects and publications) and two research domains (Physical Sciences and Engineering, and Life Sciences) over the 2011–2016 time period. Our empirical evidence reveals that, among the main dimensions indicated by the literature, research capability (measured by the dimension of doctoral programs) has the clearest and most stable impact either on the tendency to establish collaboration ties or as homophily effect. In terms of policy implications, it emerges that organizational similarity in research capability matters and policy makers should consider doctoral programs as a strategic variable to promote successful collaborations in scientific research.

AB  - Multi-label classification (MLC) is an ML task of predictive modeling in which a data instance can simultaneously belong to multiple classes.MLC is increasingly gaining interest in different application domains such as text mining, computer vision, and bioinformatics.Several MLC algorithms have been proposed in the literature, resulting in a meta-optimization problem that the user needs to address: which MLC approach to select for a given dataset?To address this algorithm selection problem, we investigate in this work the quality of an automated approach that uses characteristics of the datasets -so-called features -and a trained algorithm selector to choose which algorithm to apply for a given task.For our empirical evaluation, we use a portfolio of 38 datasets.We consider eight MLC algorithms, whose quality we evaluate using six different performance metrics.We show that our automated algorithm selector outperforms any of the single MLC algorithms, and this is for all evaluated performance measures.Our selection approach is explainable, a characteristic that we exploit to investigate which meta-features have the largest influence on the decisions made by the algorithm selector.Finally, we also quantify the importance of the most significant metafeatures for various domains.

AB  - Within natural language processing, multi-label classification is an important but challenging task. It is more complex than single-label classification since the document representations need to cover fine-grained label information, while the labels predicted by the model are often related. Recently, large pre-trained language models have achieved great performance on multi-label classification tasks, typically using embedding of [CLS] vector as the semantic representation of entire document and matching it with candidate labels. However, existing methods tend to ignore label semantics, and the relationships between labels and documents are not effectively mined. In addition, the linear layers used for fine-tuning do not take the correlations between labels into account. In this work, we propose a Multi-Label Guided Network (MLGN) capable to guide document representation with multi-label semantic information. Furthermore, we utilize correlation knowledge to enhance the original label prediction in downstream tasks. The extensive experimental trials show that MLGN transcends previous works on several publicly available datasets. Our source code is available at https://github.com/L199Q/MLGN.

AB  - Abstract Multi-label classification is becoming increasingly ubiquitous, but not much attention has been paid to interpretability. In this paper, we develop a multi-label classifier that can be represented as a concise set of simple “if-then” rules, and thus, it offers better interpretability compared to black-box models. Notably, our method is able to find a small set of relevant patterns that lead to accurate multi-label classification, while existing rule-based classifiers are myopic and wasteful in searching rules, requiring a large number of rules to achieve high accuracy. In particular, we formulate the problem of choosing multi-label rules to maximize a target function, which considers not only discrimination ability with respect to labels, but also diversity. Accounting for diversity helps to avoid redundancy, and thus, to control the number of rules in the solution set. To tackle the said maximization problem, we propose a 2-approximation algorithm, which circumvents the exponential-size search space of rules using a novel technique to sample highly discriminative and diverse rules. In addition to our theoretical analysis, we provide a thorough experimental evaluation and a case study, which indicate that our approach offers a trade-off between predictive performance and interpretability that is unmatched in previous work.

AB  - Understanding the past, present, and changing behavior of the climate requires close collaboration of a large number of researchers from many scientific domains. At present, the necessary interdisciplinary collaboration is greatly limited by the difficulties in discovering, sharing, and integrating climatic data due to the tremendously increasing data size. This paper discusses the methods and techniques for solving the inter-related problems encountered when transmitting, processing, and serving metadata for heterogeneous Earth System Observation and Modeling (ESOM) data. A cyberinfrastructure-based solution is proposed to enable effective cataloging and two-step search on big climatic datasets by leveraging state-of-the-art web service technologies and crawling the existing data centers. To validate its feasibility, the big dataset served by UCAR THREDDS Data Server (TDS), which provides Petabyte-level ESOM data and updates hundreds of terabytes of data every day, is used as the case study dataset. A complete workflow is designed to analyze the metadata structure in TDS and create an index for data parameters. A simplified registration model which defines constant information, delimits secondary information, and exploits spatial and temporal coherence in metadata is constructed. The model derives a sampling strategy for a high-performance concurrent web crawler bot which is used to mirror the essential metadata of the big data archive without overwhelming network and computing resources. The metadata model, crawler, and standard-compliant catalog service form an incremental search cyberinfrastructure, allowing scientists to search the big climatic datasets in near real-time. The proposed approach has been tested on UCAR TDS and the results prove that it achieves its design goal by at least boosting the crawling speed by 10 times and reducing the redundant metadata from 1.85 gigabytes to 2.2 megabytes, which is a significant breakthrough for making the current most non-searchable climate data servers searchable.

AB  - A large body of literature on gender differences in scientific publication output has clearly established that women scientists publish less that men do. Yet, no single explanation or group of explanations satisfactorily accounts for this difference, which has been called the "productivity puzzle". To provide a more refined portrait of the scientific publication output of women in relation to that of their male peers, we conducted a web-based survey in 2016 of individual researchers across all African countries, except Libya. The resulting 6,875 valid questionnaires submitted by respondents in the STEM, Health Science and SSH fields were analyzed using multivariate regressions on the self-reported number of articles published in the preceding 3 years. Controlling for a variety of variables including career stage, workload, mobility, research field, and collaboration, we measured the direct and moderating effect of gender on scientific production of African researchers. Our results show that, while women's scientific publication output is positively affected by collaboration and age (impediments to women's scientific output decrease later in their careers), it is negatively impacted by care-work and household chores, limited mobility, and teaching hours. Women are as prolific when they devote the same hours to other academic tasks and raise the same amount of research funding as their male colleagues. Our results lead us to argue that the standard academic career model, relying on continuous publications and regular promotions, assumes a masculine life cycle that reinforces the general perception that women with discontinuous careers are less productive than their male colleagues, and systematically disadvantages women. We conclude that the solution resides beyond women's empowerment, i.e., in the broader institutions of education and the family, which have an important role to play in fostering men's equal contribution to household chores and care-work.

AB  - In science, self-citation is often interpreted as an act of self-promotion that (artificially) boosts the visibility of one's prior work in the short term, which could then inflate professional authority in the long term.Recently, in light of research on the gender gap in self-promotion, two large-scale studies of publications examine if women self-cite less than men.But they arrive at conflicting conclusions; one concludes yes whereas the other, no.We join the debate with an original study of 36 cohorts of life scientists (1970-2005) followed through 2015 (or death or retirement).We track not only the rate of self-citation per unit of past productivity but also the likelihood of self-citing intellectually distant material and the rate of return on self-citations with respect to a host of major career outcomes, including grants, future citations, and job changes.With comprehensive, longitudinal data, we find no evidence whatsoever of a gender gap in self-citation practices or returns.Men may very well be more aggressive self-promoters than women, but this dynamic does not manifest in our sample with respect to self-citation practices.Implications of our null findings are discussed, particularly with respect to gender inequality in scientific careers more broadly.

AB  - Maximising FAIRness of biosimulation models requires a comprehensive description of model entities such as reactions, variables, and components. The COmputational Modeling in BIology NEtwork (COMBINE) community encourages the use of Resource Description Framework with composite annotations that semantically involve ontologies to ensure completeness and accuracy. These annotations facilitate scientists to find models or detailed information to inform further reuse, such as model composition, reproduction, and curation. SPARQL has been recommended as a key standard to access semantic annotation with RDF, which helps get entities precisely. However, SPARQL is unsuitable for most repository users who explore biosimulation models freely without adequate knowledge of ontologies, RDF structure, and SPARQL syntax. We propose here a text-based information retrieval approach, CASBERT, that is easy to use and can present candidates of relevant entities from models across a repository's contents. CASBERT adapts Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), where each composite annotation about an entity is converted into an entity embedding for subsequent storage in a list of entity embeddings. For entity lookup, a query is transformed to a query embedding and compared to the entity embeddings, and then the entities are displayed in order based on their similarity. The list structure makes it possible to implement CASBERT as an efficient search engine product, with inexpensive addition, modification, and insertion of entity embedding. To demonstrate and test CASBERT, we created a dataset for testing from the Physiome Model Repository and a static export of the BioModels database consisting of query-entities pairs. Measured using Mean Average Precision and Mean Reciprocal Rank, we found that our approach can perform better than the traditional bag-of-words method.

AB  - Over recent years, the emergence of electronic text processing systems has generated a vast amount of structured and unstructured data, thus creating a challenging situation for users to rummage through irrelevant information. Therefore, studies are continually looking to improve the classification process to produce more accurate results that would benefit users. This paper looks into the weighted information gain method that re-assigns wrongly classified features with new weights to provide better classification. The method focuses on the weights of the frequency bins, assuming every time a certain word frequency bin is iterated, it provides information on the target word feature. Therefore, the more iteration and re-assigning of weight occur within the bin, the more important the bin becomes, eventually providing better classification. The proposed algorithm was trained and tested using a corpus extracted from dedicated Facebook pages related to diabetes. The weighted information gain feature selection technique is then fed into a co-trained Multinomial Naïve Bayes classification algorithm that captures the labels' dependencies. The algorithm incorporates class value dependencies since the dataset used multi-label data before converting string vectors that allow the sparse distribution between features to be minimised, thus producing more accurate results. The results of this study show an improvement in classification to 61%.

AB  - As multimodal learning finds applications in a wide variety of high-stakes societal tasks, investigating their robustness becomes important. Existing work has focused on understanding the robustness of vision-and-language models to imperceptible variations on benchmark tasks. In this work, we investigate the robustness of multimodal classifiers to cross-modal dilutions – a plausible variation. We develop a model that, given a multimodal (image + text) input, generates additional dilution text that (a) maintains relevance and topical coherence with the image and existing text, and (b) when added to the original text, leads to misclassification of the multimodal input. Via experiments on Crisis Humanitarianism and Sentiment Detection tasks, we find that the performance of task-specific fusion-based multimodal classifiers drops by 23.3% and 22.5%, respectively, in the presence of dilutions generated by our model. Metric-based comparisons with several baselines and human evaluations indicate that our dilutions show higher relevance and topical coherence, while simultaneously being more effective at demonstrating the brittleness of the multimodal classifiers. Our work aims to highlight and encourage further research on the robustness of deep multimodal models to realistic variations, especially in human-facing societal applications.

Our general claim is that scientific Knowledge Management practices emerge as second-order practices whose aim is to systematically collect, take care of and mobilise first-hand disciplinary knowledge and data. Our specific thesis is that knowledge management practices are transforming biological research in at least three ways. We argue that scientific Knowledge Management a. operates with founded concepts of biological knowledge as explicated and computable, b. enables new outputs and ways of knowing within biology, and c. risks enforcing objectivist epistemologies of knowledge as some one objective thing.

AB  - Due to the efficiency of integrating semantic consensus and complementary information across different views, multi-view classification methods have attracted much attention in recent years. However, multi-view data often suffers from both the miss of view features and insufficient label information, which significantly decrease the performance of traditional multi-view classification methods in practice. Learning for such simultaneous lack of feature and label is crucial but rarely studied. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Deep Incomplete Multi-view Learning Network (DIMvLN) by incorporating graph networks and semi-supervised learning in this paper. Specifically, DIMvLN firstly designs the deep graph networks to effectively recover missing data with assigning pseudo-labels of large amounts of unlabeled instances and refine the incomplete feature information. Meanwhile, to enhance the label information, a novel pseudo-label generation strategy with the similarity constraints of unlabeled instances is proposed to exploit additional supervisory information and guide the completion module to preserve more semantic information of absent multi-view data. Besides, we design view-specific representation extractors with the autoencoder structure and contrastive loss to learn high-level semantic representations for each view, promote cross-view consistencies and augment the separability between different categories. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our DIMvLN, attaining noteworthy performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art competitors on several public benchmark datasets. Code will be available at GitHub.

AB  - The special public funding policies, formulated and implemented by provincial governments, plays an important role in the development of private universities in China. However, there is a lack of scientific evaluation on the rationality and completeness of the provincial special public funding policy of China’s private colleges and universities. Therefore, this paper uses PMC-index model and text mining technology to establish an evaluation index system for the provincial special public funding policy of private universities in China. Based on PMC-Index and PMC-Surface, 13 policy texts issued since 2010 were evaluated scientifically. The results show that the average PMC-Index of the 13 policies is 6.97, and the PMC-Surface map is smooth, which indicates that the overall structure of these policies is reasonable and the policy content has certain completeness. Only one policy is unacceptable. Through further analysis, we found that there is still much room for improvement in the content design of the sample policy, and its rationality and completeness are related to the publication time. This study is helpful to fully understand the advantages and disadvantages of the provincial special public funding policy of private universities in China.

Due to the rising amount of available data, the processing of generated data has to be automatized in a computationally efficient manner. Such a solution should also be easily implementable and reproducible independently of the details of the application domain. This paper provides a suitable and versatile usable infrastructure that deals with Big Data in the process industry on various platforms using efficient, fast and modern technologies for data gathering, processing, storing and visualization. Contrary to prior work, we provide an easy-to-use, easily reproducible, adaptable and configurable Big Data management solution with a detailed implementation description that does not require expert or domain-specific knowledge. In addition to the infrastructure implementation, we focus on monitoring both infrastructure inputs and outputs, including incoming data of processes and model predictions and performances, thus allowing for early interventions and actions if problems occur.

AB  - Most information in an enterprise is in the form of unstructured data which is usually managed using a document database. One of the key challenges is to define a generalized data model for this unstructured data and any information extracted from it using content enrichment algorithms. It is more challenging to incorporate provenance and temporal capabilities to such data models. Semantic databases use ontologies such as PROV-O to represent their provenance information expressively, and relational databases use for example Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs) concepts to represent temporal information. In this paper, we present a document model which has features inspired from Dublin core, PROV-O and temporal methodologies to generalize information extracted from unstructured data using content enrichment algorithms. Provenance information enables comparison of enrichment models, allows reproducibility and facilitates complex filtering on the enriched data. Temporal metadata helps in versioning the document and enables point-intime and history queries conveniently.

AB  - Abstract This article comparatively analyzes two manifestos in the field of quantitative science evaluation, the Altmetrics Manifesto (AM) and the Leiden Manifesto (LM). It employs perspectives from the Sociology of (E-) Valuation to make sense of highly visible critiques that organize the current discourse. Four motifs can be reconstructed from the manifestos’ valuation strategies. The AM criticizes the confinedness of established evaluation practices and pledges for an expansion of quantitative research evaluation. The LM denounces the proliferation of ill-applied research metrics and calls for an enclosure of metric research assessment. It can be shown that these motifs are organized diametrically: The two manifestos represent opposed positions in a critical discourse on (e-) valuative metrics. They manifest quantitative science evaluation as a contested field.

AB  - Workflows have become a major tool for the processing of Research Data, for example, data collection and data cleaning pipelines, data analytics, and data update feeds populating public archives. The EOSC-Life Research Infrastructure Cluster project brought together Europe’s Life Science Research Infrastructures to create an Open, Digital and Collaborative space for biological and medical research to develop a cloud-based Workflow Collaboratory. As adopting FAIR practices extends beyond data, the Workflow Collaboratory drives the implementation of FAIR computational workflows and tools. It fosters tool-focused collaborations and reuse via the sharing of data analysis workflows and offers an ecosystem of services for researchers and workflow specialists to find, use and reuse workflows. It’s web-friendly Digital Object Metadata Framework, based on RO-Crate and Bioschemas, supports the description and exchange of workflows across the services.

AB  - Serverless computing that runs functions with auto-scaling is a popular task execution pattern in the cloud-native era. By connecting serverless functions into workflows, tenants can achieve complex functionality. Prior research adopts the control-flow paradigm to orchestrate a serverless workflow. However, the control-flow paradigm inherently results in long response latency, due to the heavy data persistence overhead, sequential resource usage, and late function triggering.

AB  - Abstract Many disciplines, including the broad Field of Information (iField), offer Data Science (DS) programs. There have been significant efforts exploring an individual discipline's identity and unique contributions to the broader DS education landscape. To advance DS education in the iField, the iSchool Data Science Curriculum Committee (iDSCC) was formed and charged with building and recommending a DS education framework for iSchools. This paper reports on the research process and findings of a series of studies to address important questions: What is the iField identity in the multidisciplinary DS education landscape? What is the status of DS education in iField schools? What knowledge and skills should be included in the core curriculum for iField DS education? What are the jobs available for DS graduates from the iField? What are the differences between graduate‐level and undergraduate‐level DS education? Answers to these questions will not only distinguish an iField approach to DS education but also define critical components of DS curriculum. The results will inform individual DS programs in the iField to develop curriculum to support undergraduate and graduate DS education in their local context.

AB  - Text classification occupies an important role in natural language processing and has many applications in real life. Short text classification, as one of its subtopics, has attracted increasing interest from researchers since it is more challenging due to its semantic sparsity and insufficient labeled data. Recent studies attempt to combine graph learning and contrastive learning to alleviate the above problems in short text classification. Despite their fruitful success, there are still several inherent limitations. First, the generation of augmented views may disrupt the semantic structure within the text and introduce negative effects due to noise permutation. Second, they ignore the clustering-friendly features in unlabeled data and fail to further utilize the prior information in few valuable labeled data. To this end, we propose a novel model that utilizes improved Graph contrastIve learning for short text classiFicaTion (GIFT). Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous graph containing several component graphs by mining from an internal corpus and introducing an external knowledge graph. Then, we use singular value decomposition to generate augmented views for graph contrastive learning. Moreover, we employ constrained kmeans on labeled texts to learn clustering-friendly features, which facilitate cluster-oriented contrastive learning and assist in obtaining better category boundaries. Extensive experimental results show that GIFT significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. Our code can be found in https://github.com/KEAML-JLU/GIFT.

AB  - Most scientific databases consist of datasets (or sources) which in turn include samples (or files) with an identical structure (or schema). In many cases, samples are associated with rich metadata, describing the process that leads to building them (e.g.: the experimental conditions used during sample generation). Metadata are typically used in scientific computations just for the initial data selection; at most, metadata about query results is recovered after executing the query, and associated with its results by post-processing. In this way, a large body of information that could be relevant for interpreting query results goes unused during query processing. In this paper, we present ScQL, a new algebraic relational language, whose operations apply to objects consisting of data–metadatapairs, by preserving such one-to-one correspondence throughout the computation. We formally define each operation and we describe an optimization, called meta-first, that may significantly reduce the query processing overhead by anticipating the use of metadata for selectively loading into the execution environment only those input samples that contribute to the result samples. In ScQL, metadata have the same relevance as data, and contribute to building query results; in this way, the resulting samples are systematically associated with metadata about either the specific input samples involved or about query processing, thereby yielding a new form of metadata provenance. We present many examples of use of ScQL, relative to several application domains, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of the meta-first optimization.

AB  - Abstract NOTE: The first page of text has been automatically extracted and included below in lieu of an abstract Open Access Availability of Publications of Faculty in Three Engineering Disciplines Abstract The analysis presented here provides a snapshot in time of the open access online availability of the five most recent works of engineering faculty in five institutions that overall have heavily populated institutional repositories. The incentive for the study was to provide a measure of the inclination of engineering faculty in specific disciplines to provide open access to their most current manuscripts or articles. The Web of Science database was used to choose the five most recent publications for each faculty member in each of three disciplines: civil, chemical, and mechanical engineering. The study was done for the five United States universities that had the most overall content in their repositories, as ranked by the Registry of Open Access Repositories (http://roar.eprints.org) at the time of data collection. One of these universities was ranked by U.S. News & World Report as having the number one engineering college among schools whose highest degree is a doctorate. To determine open access availability of each article via deposition in an institutional repository, each publication title was searched using the ROAR Content Search interface. To determine other forms of open access a Google Scholar search was used. The results of an analysis of these data collected for various sources of open access with breakdowns by college and department are provided. Introduction Under the leadership of MIT in developing the DSpace system, institutional repositories (IRs) [long term electronic archives of works authored by affiliates of the institution] emerged in the United States in the fall of 20021. Built on the concept of open access, defined for these purposes as freely available online access to full text articles, and with discipline repositories such as arXiv, as a precursor, many were founded with the “build it and they will come” concept. The Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) 2, whose activities are meant in part to serve as an aid in reducing financial pressures on libraries, defines institutional repositories in terms of capturing and preserving intellectual output in their August 2002 position paper3. The paper goes on to stress the importance of open or low-barrier access and the ability to share metadata with external systems to facilitate access to the broader research community. Clifford Lynch, Executive Director, Coalition for Networked Information, defines IRs in terms of a set of management and dissemination services provided by institutions. He stresses the importance of managing technological changes by migrating digital content to assure that at least their own intellectual content is preserved. With libraries increasingly cancelling their print subscriptions in favor of somewhat less costly online only access, where are the assurances to faculty that back content will be available to them through technology changes, publisher mergers, future journal cancellations, and whatever else might transpire to cause loss of access to online content? Lynch goes on to state “that a primary responsibility of our universities is both to make these resources available and to preserve them.”1 Touting the advantages of their own IR software platform, the Digital Commons, the Berkeley Electronic Press (BePress) President and Director of Journals explains that their product expands upon the service aspect, to actually

AB  - By reviewing scientific literature, researchers may obtain a comprehensive understanding of field developments, keeping abreast of the current research status and hotspot shifts. The evolution pattern of keywords is supposed to be an efficient indicator in revealing the shifting and sustainability configuration of scientific concepts, ideas, and research hotspots. Here we take an extensive investigation of the evolution of keywords among all publications in PNAS Social Sciences from 1990 to 2021. Statistical tests show the keyword mention time series always accompanied by the emergence of a log-normal distribution. Additionally, we introduce a novel schema of four patterns (TELS), which are Transient impact type, Explosive impact type, Large impact type, and Small impact type, respectively, to illustrate the evolution of keywords. The TELS schema can be used to capture the whole life circle feature of any proposed keyword, from a pool of candidates. By dividing the entire time into four periods, we also introduce the concept of elite keywords to reveal the temporal feature of social sciences focus. An explicit transition from anthropology research to neuroscience and social problems research can be observed from the evolution diagram. We argue that the proposed method is of general sense and might be applicable to other fields of science.

AB  - <ns4:p>High-performance data analytics (HPDA) is a current trend in e-science research that aims to integrate traditional HPC with recent data analytic frameworks. Most of the work done in this field has focused on improving data analytic frameworks by implementing their engines on top of HPC technologies such as Message Passing Interface. However, there is a lack of integration from an application development perspective. HPC workflows have their own parallel programming models, while data analytic (DA) algorithms are mainly implemented using data transformations and executed with frameworks like Spark. Task-based programming models (TBPMs) are a very efficient approach for implementing HPC workflows. Data analytic transformations can also be decomposed as a set of tasks and implemented with a task-based programming model.</ns4:p><ns4:p /><ns4:p>In this paper, we present a methodology to develop HPDA applications on top of TBPMs that allow developers to combine HPC workflows and data analytic transformations seamlessly. A prototype of this approach has been implemented on top of the PyCOMPSs task-based programming model to validate two aspects: HPDA applications can be seamlessly developed and have better performance than Spark. We compare our results using different programs. Finally, we conclude with the idea of integrating DA into HPC applications and evaluation of our method against Spark.</ns4:p>

AB  - Automatic text classification and sentiment polarity detection are two important research problems of social media analysis. The meanings of the words are so important that they need to be captured by a document classification algorithm to reach an accurate classification performance. Another important issue with the text classification is the scarcity of labeled data. In this study, Combining Labeled and Unlabeled Data with Semantic Values of Terms (CLUDS) is presented. CLUDS has the following steps: preprocessing, instance labeling, combining labeled and unlabeled data, and prediction. In preprocessing step Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm is used. In instance labeling step Logistic Regression is applied. In CLUDS, relevance values computation has been applied as a supervised term weighting methodology in the text classification field. Still, according to the literature, CLUDS is the first attempt that uses both relevance and weighting calculation in a semi-supervised semantic kernel for Support Vector Machines (SVM). In this study, Sprinkled-CLUDS and Adaptive-Sprinkled-CLUDS have also been implemented. Evaluated experimental results show that CLUDS, Sprinkled-CLUDS and Adaptive-Sprinkled-CLUDS generate a valuable performance gain over the baseline algorithms on test sets.

AB  - This article discusses the key elements of the Data Science Technology course offered to postgraduate students enrolled in the Master of Data Science program. This course complements the existing curriculum by providing the skills to handle the Big Data platform and tools, in addition to data science activities. We tackle the discussion about this course based on three main requirements, which are related to the need to exploit the key skills from two dimensions, namely, Data Science and Big Data, and the need for a cluster-based computing platform and its accessibility. We address these requirements by presenting the course design and its assessments, the configuration of the computing platform, and the strategy to enable flexible accessibility. In terms of course design, the offered course contributes to several innovative elements and has covered multiple key areas of the data science body of knowledge and multiple quadrants of the job and skills matrix. In the case of the computing platform, a stable deployment of a Hadoop cluster with flexible accessibility, triggered by the pandemic situation, has been established. Furthermore, through our experience with the implementation of the cluster, it has shown the ability of the cluster to handle computing problems with a larger dataset than the one used for the semesters within the scope of the study. We also provide some reflections and highlight future improvements.

AB  - Abstract Evaluation of researchers’ output is vital for hiring committees and funding bodies, and it is usually measured via their scientific productivity, citations, or a combined metric such as the h-index. Assessing young researchers is more critical because it takes a while to get citations and increment of h-index. Hence, predicting the h-index can help to discover the researchers’ scientific impact. In addition, identifying the influential factors to predict the scientific impact is helpful for researchers and their organizations seeking solutions to improve it. This study investigates the effect of the author, paper/venue-specific features on the future h-index. For this purpose, we used a machine learning approach to predict the h-index and feature analysis techniques to advance the understanding of feature impact. Utilizing the bibliometric data in Scopus, we defined and extracted two main groups of features. The first relates to prior scientific impact, and we name it ‘prior impact-based features’ and includes the number of publications, received citations, and h-index. The second group is ‘non-prior impact-based features’ and contains the features related to author, co-authorship, paper, and venue characteristics. We explored their importance in predicting researchers’ h-index in three career phases. Also, we examined the temporal dimension of predicting performance for different feature categories to find out which features are more reliable for long- and short-term prediction. We referred to the gender of the authors to examine the role of this author’s characteristics in the prediction task. Our findings showed that gender has a very slight effect in predicting the h-index. Although the results demonstrate better performance for the models containing prior impact-based features for all researchers’ groups in the near future, we found that non-prior impact-based features are more robust predictors for younger scholars in the long term. Also, prior impact-based features lose their power to predict more than other features in the long term.

AB  - To conduct a bibliometric case study of the journal Perspectives on Medical Education (PME) to provide insights into the journal's inner workings and to "take stock" of where PME is today, where it has been, and where it might go.Data, including bibliographic metadata, reviewer and author details, and downloads, were collected for manuscripts submitted to and published in PME from the journal's Editorial Manager and Web of Science. Gender of authors and reviewers was predicted using Genderize.io. To visualize and analyze collaboration patterns, citation relationships and term co-occurrence social network analyses (SNA) were conducted. VOSviewer was used to visualize the social network maps.Between 2012-2019 PME received, on average, 260 manuscripts annually (range = 73-402). Submissions were received from authors in 81 countries with the majority in the United States (US), United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. PME published 518 manuscripts with authors based in 31 countries, the majority being in the Netherlands, US, and Canada. PME articles were downloaded 717,613 times (mean per document: 1388). In total 1201 (55% women) unique peer reviewers were invited and 649 (57% women) completed reviews; 1227 (49% women) unique authors published in PME. SNA revealed that PME authors were quite collaborative, with most authoring articles with others and only a minority (n = 57) acting as single authors.This case study provides a glimpse into PME and offers evidence for PME's next steps. In the future, PME is committed to growing the journal thoughtfully; diversifying and educating editorial teams, authors, and reviewers, and liberating and sharing journal data.

AB  - In China, it has long become imperative for the management of education and science and technology to build high-level scientific and technological innovation teams. Scientifically and accurately identifying core scientific research teams is an important condition for cultivating and building such teams. The absolute threshold method (e.g., c-level clique at, n- clique, k-core) is the prevailing means of identifying core teams and their core members. In fact, effects such as “the preference-dependent effect”, “the apostle effect” and “the star effect”, the cooperative relationship between the researchers is not even. This study, based on the co-authorship network, found that not choosing the absolute threshold properly can easily lead to poor identification of core members of some teams. Even worse, when the absolute threshold is too large, this “uniform” evaluation criterion of tie strength results in the elimination of some core teams in some disciplines. This paper uses relative tie strength to identify core scientific research teams from a new perspective, which can effectively avoid the situation of some core team members being ignored because of the mandatory requirements of the absolute tie strength among members, and can also solve the challenge of threshold selections for identifying different teams.

AB  - In modern times, there has been an exorbitant rise in unstructured digital text, owing to the ever-increasing use of internet.Therefore, to be able to extract knowledge out of it, a perceived need was felt to organize the enormous amount of digital text into different categories.This is why Text Classification is considered a critical task in NLP (Natural Language Processing).This research suggests a hybrid model(C-LSTM-ATC) that combines the benefits of two deep learning models, namely, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long and Short Term Memory (LSTM), to categorize Assamese text, a topic that largely remains unexplored till now.Another hybrid model was also tried by combining LSTM with the Support Vector Machine (LSTM-SVM).The C-LSTM-ATC model performs splendidly with an accuracy of 97.2% while the LSTM-SVM model outputs an accuracy of 92.2% when tested on the dataset prepared.The model was trained using as many as 768 Assamese text documents and the test results showed that the proposed C-LSTM-ATC model produces more accurate classification and higher F1 scores, than the LSTM-SVM and also the CNN and LSTM models when used separately.

However, data scientists often pay attention only to the code and neglect the creation of the documentation in a notebook. In this work, we present a human-centered automation system, Themisto, that can support users to easily create documentation via three approaches: 1) We have developed and reported a GNN-augmented code documentation generation algorithm in a previous paper, which can generate documentation for a given source code; 2) Themisto also implements a query-based approach to retrieve the online API documentation as the summary for certain types of source code; 3) Lastly, Themistoalso enables a user prompt approach to motivate users to write documentation for some use cases that automation does not work well.

AB  - Does open access (OA) to journal articles foster citations to these articles? We compare the citation impact of gold and green OA in two disciplines: Biology and Economics &amp; Management. The empirical analysis covers all articles of these disciplines included in the Web of Science “Journal Citation Reports” between 2000 and 2019. We show that, controlling for confounding variables pertaining to the journals and articles, gold OA increases citations across all articles. However, the individual disciplines feature starkly different effects: a 18.3% increase in Biology, compared to a decrease by 30.9% in Economics &amp; Management. Also Green OA leads to an increase in citations to academic research. These results are confirmed by a number of robustness checks.

Accordingly, a total of 26306 publications from 1915 to 2021 are evaluated based on the Scopus database with the help of scientific tools such as Hitcite, Biblioshiny and VoS viewer. The results show that the resourcefulness experts are identified in terms of their publication only, that namely Drewnowski, Kesselheim. On the other hand, the author Popkini is considered as the key author rather than the above-said authors in terms of global citations. The similarity in the above context is that all the topmost authors belong to the USA. More importantly, the summary of citations in total publication output is revealed that a single paper is recorded the range of citations between 1042-2766, the 500 citations are recorded from the 64 papers, and 844 papers accounted with more than 100 citations.

AB  - User research for scientific software can inform design and account for the unique concerns of academic researchers. In this study, we explored the user experience on a testbed for cloud computing research, CloudLab. Through 15 semi-structured interviews and observation, we observed the importance of time as a resource to system users. We observed CloudLab users strategically coordinating their time on the platform with other users, navigating the constraints of publication and other academic deadlines. Surprisingly, we found that this coordination may involve altruistic behaviors where users share time on CloudLab that had been allocated for personal use. In light of prior CSCW literature on how actors seek to harness time, we propose concrete opportunities for design interventions. Our strategy across all possible interventions is to increase users' awareness of the rhythms affecting their peers' platform use, allowing coordination based not just on knowledge of CloudLab reservations but also users' progress toward deadlines. The implications of this work inform the design of other similar cyberinfrastructure systems in science where users independently coordinate use of resources.

AB  - Collaborations between scientists from the global north and global south (N-S collaborations) are a key driver of the "fourth paradigm of science" and have proven crucial to addressing global crises like COVID-19 and climate change. However, despite their critical role, N-S collaborations on datasets are not well understood. Science of science studies tend to rely on publications and patents to examine N-S collaboration patterns. To this end, the rise of global crises requiring N-S collaborations to produce and share data presents an urgent need to understand the prevalence, dynamics, and political economy of N-S collaborations on research datasets. In this paper, we employ a mixed methods case study research approach to analyze the frequency of and division of labor in N-S collaborations on datasets submitted to GenBank over 29 years (1992-2021). We find: (1) there is a low representation of N-S collaborations over the 29-year period. When they do occur, N-S collaborations display "burstiness" patterns, suggesting that N-S collaborations on datasets are formed and maintained reactively in the wake of global health crises such as infectious disease outbreaks; (2) The division of labor between datasets and publications is disproportionate to the global south in the early years, but becomes more overlapping after 2003. An exception in the case of countries with lower S&T capacity but high income, where these countries have a higher prevalence on datasets (e.g., United Arab Emirates). We qualitatively inspect a sample of N-S dataset collaborations to identify leadership patterns in dataset and publication authorship. The findings lead us to argue there is a need to include N-S dataset collaborations in measures of research outputs to nuance the current models and assessment tools of equity in N-S collaborations. The paper contributes to the SGDs objectives to develop data-driven metrics that can inform scientific collaborations on research datasets.

AB  - Abstract Conducting a project with multiple participants is a complex task that involves multiple social, economic, and psychological interactions. Conducting academic research in general and the process of writing an academic manuscript, in particular, is notorious for being challenging to successfully navigate due to the current form of collaboration dynamics common in academia. In this study, we propose a game-theory-based model for a co-authorship writing project in which authors are allowed to raise an ultimatum, blocking the publishment of the manuscript if they do not get more credit for the work. Using the proposed model, we explore the influence of the contribution and utility of publishing the manuscript on the rate one or more authors would gain from raising an ultimatum. Similarly, we show that the project’s duration and the current state have a major impact on this rate, as well as the number of authors. In addition, we examine common student-advisor and colleague-colleague co-authorships scenarios. Our model reveals disturbing results and demonstrates that the current, broadly accepted, academic practices for collaborations are designed in a way that stimulates authors to raise an ultimatum and stopped only by their integrity and not by a systematic design.

AB  - Text classification is one of the most important tasks in natural language processing and information retrieval due to the increasing availability of documents in digital form and the ensuing need to access them in flexible ways. By assigning documents to labeled classes, text classification can reduce the search space and expedite the process of retrieving relevant documents. In this paper, we propose a novel text representation method, Hybrid Word Embeddings (HWE), which combines semantic information obtained fromWord- Net and contextual information extracted from text documents to provide concise and accurate representations of text documents. The proposed HWE method can improve the efficiency of deriving word semantics from text by taking advantage of the semantic relationships extracted from WordNet with less training corpus. Experimental study on classification of documents shows that the proposed HWE outperforms existing methods, including Doc2Vec and Word2Vec, in terms of classification accuracy, recall, precision, etc.

AB  - Feature selection is an important way to optimize the efficiency and accuracy of classifiers. However, traditional feature selection methods cannot work with many kinds of data in the real world, such as multi-label data. To overcome this challenge, multi-label feature selection is developed. Multi-label feature selection plays an irreplaceable role in pattern recognition and data mining. This process can improve the efficiency and accuracy of multi-label classification. However, traditional multi-label feature selection based on mutual information does not fully consider the effect of redundancy among labels. The deficiency may lead to repeated computing of mutual information and leave room to enhance the accuracy of multi-label feature selection. To deal with this challenge, this paper proposed a multi-label feature selection based on conditional mutual information among labels (CRMIL). Firstly, we analyze how to reduce the redundancy among features based on existing papers. Secondly, we propose a new approach to diminish the redundancy among labels. This method takes label sets as conditions to calculate the relevance between features and labels. This approach can weaken the impact of the redundancy among labels on feature selection results. Finally, we analyze this algorithm and balance the effects of relevance and redundancy on the evaluation function. For testing CRMIL, we compare it with the other eight multi-label feature selection algorithms on ten datasets and use four evaluation criteria to examine the results. Experimental results illustrate that CRMIL performs better than other existing algorithms.

AB  - We studied journal articles published by researchers at all eight New Zealand universities in 2017 to determine how many were freely accessible on the web. We wrote software code to harvest data from multiple sources, code that we now share to enable others to reproduce our work on their own sample set. In May 2019, we ran our code to determine which of the 2017 articles were open at that time and by what method; where those articles would have incurred an Article Processing Charge (APC) we calculated the cost if those charges had been paid. Where articles were not freely available we determined whether the policies of publishers in each case would have allowed deposit in a non-commercial repository (Green open access). We also examined citation rates for different types of access. We found that, of our 2017 sample set, about two out of every five articles were freely accessible without payment or subscription (41%). Where research was explicitly said to be funded by New Zealand’s major research funding agencies, the proportion was slightly higher at 45%. Where open articles would have incurred an APC we estimated an average cost per article of USD1,682 (for publications where all articles require an APC, that is, Gold open access) and USD2,558 (where APC payment is optional, Hybrid open access) at a total estimated cost of USD1.45m. Of the paid options, Gold is by far more common for New Zealand researchers (82% Gold, 18% Hybrid). In terms of citations, our analysis aligned with previous studies that suggest a correlation between publications being freely accessible and, on balance, slightly higher rates of citation. This is not seen across all types of open access, however, with Diamond OA achieving the lowest rates. Where articles were not freely accessible we found that a very large majority of them (88% or 3089 publications) could have been legally deposited in an institutional repository. Similarly, only in a very small number of cases had a version deposited in the repository of a New Zealand university made the difference between the publication being freely accessible or not (125 publications). Given that most New Zealand researchers support research being open, there is clearly a large gap between belief and practice in New Zealand’s research ecosystem.

AB  - Exponential growth of electronic data requires advanced multi-label classification approaches for the development of natural language processing (NLP) applications such as recommendation systems, drug reaction detection, hate speech detection, and opinion recognition/mining. To date, several machine and deep learning–based multi-label classification methodologies have been proposed for English, French, German, Chinese, Arabic, and other developed languages. Urdu is the 11th largest language in the world and has no computer-aided multi-label textual news classification approach. Unlike other languages, Urdu is lacking multi-label text classification datasets that can be used to benchmark the performance of existing machine and deep learning methodologies. With an aim to accelerate and expedite research for the development of Urdu multi-label text classification–based applications, this article provides multiple contributions as follows: First, it provides a manually annotated multi-label textual news classification dataset for the Urdu language. Second, it benchmarks the performance of traditional machine learning approaches particularly by adapting three data transformation approaches along with three top-performing machine learning classifiers and four algorithm adaptation-based approaches. Third, it benchmarks performance of 16 existing deep learning approaches and the four most widely used language models. Finally, it provides an ensemble approach that reaps the benefits of three different deep learning architectures to precisely predict different classes associated with a particular Urdu textual document. Experimental results reveal that proposed ensemble approach performance values (87% accuracy, 92% F1-score, and 8% hamming loss) are significantly higher than adapted machine and deep learning–based approaches.

AB  - The problem of text classification has been a mainstream research branch in natural language processing, and how to improve the effect of classification under the scarcity of labeled samples is one of the hot issues in this direction. The current models supporting small-sample classification can learn knowledge and train models with a small number of labels, but the classification results are not satisfactory enough. In order to improve the classification accuracy, we propose a Small-sample Text Classification model based on the Pseudo-label fusion Clustering algorithm (STCPC). The algorithm includes two cores: (1) Mining the potential features of unlabeled data by using the training strategy of clustering assuming pseudo-labeling and then reducing the noise of the pseudo-labeled dataset by consistent training with its enhanced samples to improve the quality of the pseudo-labeled dataset. (2) The labeled data is augmented, and then the Easy Plug-in Data Augmentation (EPiDA) framework is used to balance the diversity and quality of the augmented samples to improve the richness of the labeled data reasonably. The results of comparison tests with other classical algorithms show that the STCPC model can effectively improve classification accuracy.

AB  - Abstract Firms with the assets complementary to Artificial Intelligence (AI) have actively conducted AI research and selectively published their results since AI has resurged around 2006. Focusing on the recent AI development, we investigate how and to what extent firms’ deep engagement in the publication of emerging science-related technology can influence the evolution of published knowledge. Using bibliometric analyses applied to the papers in major AI conferences and journals, we find that papers with at least one author affiliated to a firm, and particularly papers with only firm-affiliated author(s), have had higher influence on the formation of published knowledge trajectory than other papers. In addition, papers from firm and non-firm (university and public research institution) collaborations show higher novelty and conventionality than other papers. These findings deepen our understanding of the role of firms in the evolution of emerging science-related technology.

AB  - Purpose To assess whether interdisciplinary research evaluation scores vary between fields. Design/methodology/approach The authors investigate whether published refereed journal articles were scored differently by expert assessors (two per output, agreeing a score and norm referencing) from multiple subject-based Units of Assessment (UoAs) in the REF2021 UK national research assessment exercise. The primary raw data was 8,015 journal articles published 2014–2020 and evaluated by multiple UoAs, and the agreement rates were compared to the estimated agreement rates for articles multiply-evaluated within a single UoA. Findings The authors estimated a 53% agreement rate on a four-point quality scale between UoAs for the same article and a within-UoA agreement rate of 70%. This suggests that quality scores vary more between fields than within fields for interdisciplinary research. There were also some hierarchies between fields, in the sense of UoAs that tended to give higher scores for the same article than others. Research limitations/implications The results apply to one country and type of research evaluation. The agreement rate percentage estimates are both based on untested assumptions about the extent of cross-checking scores for the same articles in the REF, so the inferences about the agreement rates are tenuous. Practical implications The results underline the importance of choosing relevant fields for any type of research evaluation. Originality/value This is the first evaluation of the extent to which a careful peer-review exercise generates different scores for the same articles between disciplines.

AB  - Academic patent trading is one of the important ways for university technology transfer.Compared to industry patent trading, academic patent trading suffers from a more serious information asymmetric problem.It needs a recommendation service to help companies identify academic patents that they want to pay.However, existing recommendation approaches have limitations in facilitating academic patent trading in online patent platforms because most of them only consider patent-level characteristics.A high trust degree of a company towards academic patents can alleviate the information asymmetry and encourage trading.This study proposes a novel academic patent recommendation approach with a hybrid strategy, combining citation-based relevance, connectivity, and trustworthiness.An offline experiment is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed recommendation approach.The results show that the proposed method performs better than the baseline methods in both accuracy and ranking.

AB  - Researchers in experimental cybersecurity are increasingly sharing the code, data, and other artifacts associated with their studies. This trend is encouraged and rewarded by conferences and journals through practices such as artifact evaluation and badging. While these trends in sharing artifacts are promising, the cybersecurity community is still far from an ecosystem in which artifacts are FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. The lack of established standards and best practices for sharing and reuse results in artifacts that are often difficult to find and reuse; in addition, the lack of community standards results in artifacts that may be incomplete and low-quality. In this paper we describe our experience in creating an online community hub, called SEARCCH, to promote the sharing and reuse of artifacts for cybersecurity research. Based on our experience, we offer lessons learned: issues that must be addressed to further promote FAIR principles in experimental cybersecurity.

AB  - With increased mental health awareness, identifying mental illness is becoming a significant problem.Due to the complexity of mental ailments, many psychiatrists find it impossible to diagnose and cure patients before it is too late.However, the everyday use of social media creates an atmosphere that may reveal extra information about a patient's mental illness.This study conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to address research questions.Some aspects of how depression decision-making is detected using different datasets covering social media, surveys, and medical bio-markers.However, most studies employ Machine learning and deep learning models like RNN to predict depression decision-making due to the lack of data.This study will try to identify a more effective way of identifying the overfitting solution during text-based training and learning while discussing various depression detection algorithms.

AB  - Abstract Judging value of scholarly outputs quantitatively remains a difficult but unavoidable challenge. Most of the proposed solutions suffer from three fundamental shortcomings: they involve (i) the concept of journal, in one way or another, (ii) calculating arithmetic averages from extremely skewed distributions, and (iii) binning data by calendar year. Here, we introduce a new metric Co-citation Percentile Rank (CPR), that relates the current citation rate of the target output taken at resolution of days since first citable, to the distribution of current citation rates of outputs in its co-citation set, as its percentile rank in that set. We explore some of its properties with an example dataset of all scholarly outputs from University of Jyväskylä spanning multiple years and disciplines. We also demonstrate how CPR can be efficiently implemented with Dimensions database API, and provide a publicly available web resource JYUcite, allowing anyone to retrieve CPR value for any output that has a DOI and is indexed in the Dimensions database. Finally, we discuss how CPR remedies failures of the Relative Citation Ratio (RCR), and remaining issues in situations where CPR too could potentially lead to biased judgement of value.

AB  - Abstract Cross‐affiliation emerges as a new and fast‐developing means to promote collaboration in financial research. We find that the average number of affiliations reported per author in the top‐three finance journals increases steadily from 1.1 to 1.3 from 1995 to 2016. Scale‐free power laws characterize the resulting highly‐skewed distributions of top finance journal publications of worldwide institutions. We propose an explanation of the scale‐invariance, based on a network model featuring nonlinear growth and linear preferential attachment. The model indicates that success‐breeds‐success engenders 87% of total publications and hence the dispersion in research output, while accelerated growth of collaboration reduces the heterogeneity.

AB  - Abstract Recently, it has become a popular strategy in multi-label image recognition to predict those labels that co-occur in a picture. Previous work has concentrated on capturing label correlation but has neglected to correctly fuse picture features and label embeddings, which has a substantial influence on the model’s convergence efficiency and restricts future multi-label image recognition accuracy improvement. In order to better classify labeled training samples of corresponding categories in the field of image classification, a cross-modal multi-label image classification modeling and recognition method based on nonlinear is proposed. Multi-label classification models based on deep convolutional neural networks are constructed respectively. The visual classification model uses natural images and simple biomedical images with single labels to achieve heterogeneous transfer learning and homogeneous transfer learning, capturing the general features of the general field and the proprietary features of the biomedical field, while the text classification model uses the description text of simple biomedical images to achieve homogeneous transfer learning. The experimental results show that the multi-label classification model combining the two modes can obtain a hamming loss similar to the best performance of the evaluation task, and the macro average F 1 value increases from 0.20 to 0.488, which is about 52.5% higher. The cross-modal multi-label image classification algorithm can better alleviate the problem of overfitting in most classes and has better cross-modal retrieval performance. In addition, the effectiveness and rationality of the two cross-modal mapping techniques are verified.

AB  - Multi-label classification addresses the issues that more than one class label assigns to each instance. Many real-world multi-label classification tasks are high-dimensional due to digital technologies, leading to reduced performance of traditional multi-label classifiers. Feature selection is a common and successful approach to tackling this problem by retaining relevant features and eliminating redundant ones to reduce dimensionality. There is several feature selection that is successfully applied in multi-label learning. Most of those features are wrapper methods that employ a multi-label classifier in their processes. They run a classifier in each step, which requires a high computational cost, and thus they suffer from scalability issues. Filter methods are introduced to evaluate the feature subsets using information-theoretic mechanisms instead of running classifiers to deal with this issue. Most of the existing researches and review papers dealing with feature selection in single-label data. While, recently multi-label classification has a wide range of real-world applications such as image classification, emotion analysis, text mining, and bioinformatics. Moreover, researchers have recently focused on applying swarm intelligence methods in selecting prominent features of multi-label data. To the best of our knowledge, there is no review paper that reviews swarm intelligence-based methods for multi-label feature selection. Thus, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of different swarm intelligence and evolutionary computing methods of feature selection presented for multi-label classification tasks. To this end, in this review, we have investigated most of the well-known and state-of-the-art methods and categorize them based on different perspectives. We then provided the main characteristics of the existing multi-label feature selection techniques and compared them analytically. We also introduce benchmarks, evaluation measures, and standard datasets to facilitate research in this field. Moreover, we performed some experiments to compare existing works, and at the end of this survey, some challenges, issues, and open problems of this field are introduced to be considered by researchers in the future.

AB  - The Quran and the hadith of the Prophet are the two sources of legislation for Muslims. Sharia rulings and laws are not only derived from the Quran but also the bulk of them come through hadith. Understanding the hadith, its classification, and verification of its authenticity is vital to reach detailed rulings, as the volume of the hadith is many times greater than the volume of the Quran. As a result, mining in the hadith text is one of the things that has attracted the attention of researchers in the past few years. In this study, we conducted a survey of all the techniques and systems related to the mining of the hadith in its two parts, the Al-Matn and the Al-Sanad. On the other hand, the challenges and obstacles which confronted researchers have been shown; in addition, some suggested tips were highlighted to overcome those challenges. Furthermore, the most essential modern techniques used in the classification of Arabic texts, which gave a high degree of efficiency, were highlighted as milestones for future studies.

AB  - This paper uses newly available data from Web of Science on publications matched to researchers in Survey of Doctorate Recipients to compare the quality of scientific publication data collected by surveys versus algorithmic approaches. We illustrate the different types of measurement errors in self-reported and machine-generated data by estimating how publication measures from the two approaches are related to career outcomes (e.g., salaries and faculty rankings). We find that the potential biases in the self-reports are smaller relative to the algorithmic data. Moreover, the errors in the two approaches are quite intuitive: the measurement errors in algorithmic data are mainly due to the accuracy of matching, which primarily depends on the frequency of names and the data that was available to make matches, while the noise in self reports increases over the career as researchers’ publication records become more complex, harder to recall, and less immediately relevant for career progress. At a methodological level, we show how the approaches can be evaluated using accepted statistical methods without gold standard data. We also provide guidance on how to use the new linked data.

AB  - Hierarchical text classification (HTC) is a key problem and task in many industrial applications, which aims to predict labels organized in a hierarchy for given input text. For example, HTC can group the descriptions of online products into a taxonomy or organizing customer reviews into a hierarchy of categories. In real-life applications, while Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have dominated many NLP tasks, they face significant challenges too—the conventional fine-tuning process needs to modify and save models with a huge number of parameters. This is becoming more critical for HTC in both global and local modelling—the latter needs to learn multiple classifiers at different levels/nodes in a hierarchy. The concern will be even more serious since PLM sizes are continuing to increase in order to attain more competitive performances. Most recently, prefix tuning has become a very attractive technology by only tuning and saving a tiny set of parameters. Exploring prefix turning for HTC is hence highly desirable and has timely impact. In this paper, we investigate prefix tuning on HTC in two typical setups: local and global HTC. Our experiment shows that the prefix-tuning model only needs less than 1% of parameters and can achieve performance comparable to regular full fine-tuning. We demonstrate that using contrastive learning in learning prefix vectors can further improve HTC performance.

AB  - Structure-based virtual screening simulations, which are often used in drug discovery, can be very computationally demanding. This is why user-friendly domain-specific web or desktop applications that enable running simulations on powerful computing infrastructures have been created. This article investigates how domain-specific desktop applications can be extended to use cloud computing and how they can be part of scenarios that require sharing and analysing previous molecular docking results. A generic approach based on interviews with scientists and analysis of existing systems is proposed. A proof of concept is implemented using the Raccoon2 desktop application for virtual screening, WS-PGRADE workflows, gUSE services with the CloudBroker Platform, the structural alignment tool DeepAlign, and the ligand similarity tool LIGSIFT. The presented analysis illustrates that this approach of extending a domain-specific desktop application can use different types of clouds, thus facilitating the execution of virtual screening simulations by life scientists without requiring them to abandon their favourite desktop environment and providing them resources without major capital investment. It also shows that storing and sharing molecular docking results can produce additional conclusions such as viewing similar docking input files for verification or learning.

AB  - Ontology plays a critical role in knowledge engineering and knowledge graphs (KGs). However, building ontology is still a nontrivial task. Ontology learning aims at generating domain ontologies from various kinds of resources by natural language processing and machine learning techniques. One major challenge of ontology learning is reducing labeling work for new domains. This paper proposes an ontology learning method based on transfer learning, namely TF-Mnt, which aims at learning knowledge from new domains that have limited labeled data. This paper selects Web data as the learning source and defines various features, which utilizes abundant textual information and heterogeneous semi-structured information. Then, a new transfer learning model TF-Mnt is proposed, and the parameters’ estimation is also addressed. Although there exist distribution differences of features between two domains, TF-Mnt can measure the relevance by calculating the correlation coefficient. Moreover, TF-Mnt can efficiently transfer knowledge from the source domain to the target domain and avoid negative transfer. Experiments in real-world datasets show that TF-Mnt achieves promising learning performance for new domains despite the small number of labels in it, by learning knowledge from a proper existing domain which can be automatically selected.

AB  - For extreme multi-label classification (XMC), existing classification-based models poorly per- form for tail labels and often ignore the semantic relations among labels, like treating"Wikipedia" and "Wiki" as independent and separate labels. In this paper, we cast XMC as a generation task (XLGen), where we benefit from pre-trained text-to-text models. However, generating labels from the extremely large label space is challenging without any constraints or guidance. We, therefore, propose to guide label generation using label cluster information to hierarchically generate lower-level labels. We also find that frequency-based label ordering and using decoding ensemble methods are critical factors for the improvements in XLGen. XLGen with cluster guidance significantly outperforms the classification and generation baselines on tail labels, and also generally improves the overall performance in four popular XMC benchmarks. In human evaluation, we also find XLGen generates unseen but plausible labels. Our code is now available at https:// github.com/alexa/xlgen-eacl-2023.

AB  - A company maintains and improves its quality services by paying attention to reviews and complaints from users. The complaints from users are commonly written using human natural language expression so that their messages are computationally difficult to extract and proceed. To overcome this difficulty, in this study, we presented a new system for issues feature extraction from usersâ€™ reviews and complaints from social media data. This system consists of four main functions: (1) Data Crawling and Preprocessing, (2) Categorization Knowledge Modelling, (3) Rule-based Sentiment Analysis, and (4) Application Environment. Data Crawling and Preprocessing provides data acquisition from usersâ€™ tweets on social media, crawls the data and applies the data preprocessing. Categorization Knowledge Modelling provides text mining of textual data, vector space transformation to create knowledge metadata, context recognition of keyword queries to the knowledge metadata, and similarity measurement for categorization. In the Rule-based Sentiment Analysis, we developed our own rules of computatioal linguistics to measure polarity of sentiment. Application Environment consists of 3 layers: database management, back-end services and front-end services. For applicability of our proposed system, we conducted two kinds of experimental study: (1) categorization performance, and (2) sentiment analysis performance. For categorization performance, we used 8743 tweet data and performed 82% of accuracy. For categorization performance, we made experiments on 217 tweet data and performed 92% of accuracy.

AB  - Modelling and Simulation (M&amp;S) are core tools for designing, analysing and operating today’s industrial systems. They often also represent both a valuable asset and a significant investment. Typically, their use is constrained to a software environment intended to be used by engineers on a single computer. However, the knowledge relevant to a task involving modelling and simulation is in general distributed in nature, even across organizational boundaries, and may be large in volume. Therefore, it is desirable to increase the FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse) of M&amp;S capabilities; to enable their use in loosely coupled systems of systems; and to support their composition and execution by intelligent software agents. In this contribution, the suitability of Semantic Web technologies to achieve these goals is investigated and an open-source proof of concept-implementation based on the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard is presented. Specifically, models, model instances, and simulation results are exposed through a hypermedia API and an implementation of the Pragmatic Proof Algorithm (PPA) is used to successfully demonstrate the API’s use by a generic software agent. The solution shows an increased degree of FAIRness and fully supports its use in loosely coupled systems. The FAIRness could be further improved by providing more “ rich” (meta)data.

AB  - Porting a scientific data analysis workflow (DAW) to a cluster infrastructure, a new software stack, or even only a new dataset with some notably different properties is often challenging. Despite the structured definition of the steps (tasks) and their interdependencies during a complex data analysis in the DAW specification, relevant assumptions may remain unspecified and implicit. Such hidden assumptions often lead to crashing tasks without a reasonable error message, poor performance in general, non-terminating executions, or silent wrong results of the DAW, to name only a few possible consequences. Searching for the causes of such errors and drawbacks in a distributed compute cluster managed by a complex infrastructure stack, where DAWs for large datasets typically are executed, can be tedious and time-consuming. We propose validity constraints (VCs) as a new concept for DAW languages to alleviate this situation. A VC is a constraint specifying logical conditions that must be fulfilled at certain times for DAW executions to be valid. When defined together with a DAW, VCs help to improve the portability, adaptability, and reusability of DAWs by making implicit assumptions explicit. Once specified, VCs can be controlled automatically by the DAW infrastructure, and violations can lead to meaningful error messages and graceful behaviour (e.g., termination or invocation of repair mechanisms). We provide a broad list of possible VCs, classify them along multiple dimensions, and compare them to similar concepts one can find in related fields. We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation for the workflow system Nextflow.

AB  - Abstract This paper analyzes the research performance evolution of a scientific institute, from its genesis through various stages of development. The main aim is to obtain, and visually represent, bibliometric evidence of the correlation of organizational changes on the development of its scientific performance; particularly, structural and leadership changes. The study involves six bibliometric indicators to multidimensionally assess the evolution of the institution’s performance profile. For a case study, we selected the Renewable Energy Institute at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, created 35 years ago as a small laboratory, then it evolved to a research center and finally to a formal institute, which over the last 8 years changed from the traditional departmental structure to a network-based structure. The evolution of the multidimensional performance profiles is analyzed, and graphically represented, using a novel artificial intelligence-based approach. We analyzed the performance profiles evolution yearly, using Principal Components Analysis, and a self-organizing neural network mapping technique. This approach, combining bibliometric and machine learning techniques, proved to be effective for the assessment of the institution’s evolution process. The results were represented with a series of graphs and maps that clearly reveal the magnitude and nature of the performance profile evolution, as well as its correlation with each of the structural and leadership transitions. These exploratory results have provided us data and insights into the probable effects of these transitions on academic performance, that have been useful to create a dynamical model.

AB  - SVM), emotional textEmotional analysis in texts is one of the difficult problems in text feature extraction.Semantic information is not unique for a large number of text features, which increases the difference in feature weight.Previous studies had dimensional disasters, loss of feature information, and a weak generalization ability in text feature extraction.To solve these problems, we first analyzed the advantages of support vector machines (SVMs) by multiple kernel learning (MKL).Then, an algorithm with local multiple kernel learning (LMKL) was proposed for a threshold model to select the locally optimal kernel function.It helped understand which text feature distinguishes emotions more effectively.Next, we analyzed the features of the local multiple kernel learning algorithm and discussed its generalization ability.The effectiveness of the method in this study was verified through comparison with other methods.The method reduced the feature dimensionality of the sample data set.Since the features with a weak classification ability were reduced, the accuracy of the classification was improved with increased efficiency.

AB  - Abstract Purpose The purpose of this study is to propose an improved credit allocation method that makes the leading author of the paper more distinguishable and makes the deification more robust under malicious manipulations. Design/methodology/approach We utilize a modified Sigmoid function to handle the fat-tail distributed citation counts. We also remove the target paper in calculating the contribution of co-citations. Following previous studies, we use 30 Nobel Prize-winning papers and their citation networks based on the American Physical Society (APS) and the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) dataset to test the accuracy of our proposed method (NCCAS). In addition, we use 654,148 articles published in the field of computer science from 2000 to 2009 in the MAG dataset to validate the distinguishability and robustness of NCCAS. Finding Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, NCCAS gives the most accurate prediction of Nobel laureates. Furthermore, the leading author of the paper identified by NCCAS is more distinguishable compared with other co-authors. The results by NCCAS are also more robust to malicious manipulation. Finally, we perform ablation studies to show the contribution of different components in our methods. Research limitations Due to limited ground truth on the true leading author of a work, the accuracy of NCCAS and other related methods can only be tested in Nobel Physics Prize-winning papers. Practical implications NCCAS is successfully applied to a large number of publications, demonstrating its potential in analyzing the relationship between the contribution and the recognition of authors with different by-line orders. Originality/value Compared with existing methods, NCCAS not only identifies the leading author of a paper more accurately, but also makes the deification more distinguishable and more robust, providing a new tool for related studies.

AB  - Abstract We propose an innovative use of the Leiden Rankings (LR) in institutional management. Although LR only consider research output of major universities reported in Web of Science (WOS) and share the limitations of other existing rankings, we show that they can be used as a base of a heuristic approach to identify “outlying” institutions that perform significantly below or above expectations. Our approach is a non-rigorous intuitive method (“heuristic”) because is affected by all the biases due to the technical choices and incompleteness that affect the LR but offers the possibility to discover interesting findings to be systematically verified later. We propose to use LR as a departure base on which to apply statistical analysis and network mapping to identify “outlier” institutions to be analyzed in detail as case studies. Outliers can inform and guide science policies about alternative options. Analyzing the publications of the Politecnico di Bari in more detail, we observe that “small teams” led by young and promising scholars can push the performance of a university up to the top of the LR. As argued by Moed (Applied evaluative informetrics. Springer International Publishing, Berlin, 2017a), supporting “emerging teams”, can provide an alternative to research support policies, adopted to encourage virtuous behaviours and best practices in research. The results obtained by this heuristic approach need further verification and systematic analysis but may stimulate further studies and insights on the topics of university rankings policy, institutional management, dynamics of teams, good research practice and alternative funding methods.

AB  - Abstract Multi-label distribution is a popular direction in current machine learning research and is relevant to many practical problems. In multi-label learning, samples are usually described by high-dimensional features, many of which are redundant or invalid. This paper proposes a multi-label static feature selection algorithm to solve the problems caused by high-dimensional features of multi-label learning samples. This algorithm is based on label importance and label relevance, and improves the neighborhood rough set model. One reason for using neighborhood rough sets is that feature selection using neighborhood rough sets does not require any prior knowledge of the feature space structure. Another reason is that it does not destroy the neighborhood and order structure of the data when processing multi-label data. The method of mutual information is used to achieve the extension from single labels to multiple labels in the multi-label neighborhood; through this method, the label importance and label relevance of multi-label data are connected. In addition, in the multi-label task scenario, features may be interdependent and interrelated, and features often arrive incrementally or can be extracted continuously; we call these flow features. Traditional static feature selection algorithms do not handle flow features well. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic feature selection algorithm for flow features, which is based on previous static feature selection algorithms. The proposed static and dynamic algorithms have been tested on a multi-label learning task set and the experimental results show the effectiveness of both algorithms.

AB  - Today text classification becomes critical task for concerned individuals for numerous purposes. Hence, several researches have been conducted to develop automatic text classification for national and international languages. However, the need for an automatic text categorization system for local languages is felt. The main aim of this study is to establish a Pashto automatic text classification system. In order to pursue this work, we built a Pashto corpus which is a collection of Pashto documents due to the unavailability of public datasets of Pashto text documents. Besides, this study compares several models containing both statistical and neural network machine learning techniques including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), decision tree, gaussian naïve Bayes, multinomial naïve Bayes, random forest, and logistic regression to discover the most effective approach. Moreover, this investigation evaluates two different feature extraction methods including unigram, and Time Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (IFIDF). Subsequently, this research obtained average testing accuracy rate 94% using MLP classification algorithm and TFIDF feature extraction method in this context.

AB  - Due to the vast amounts of textual data available in various forms such as online content, social media comments, corporate data, public e-services and media data, text clustering has been experiencing rapid development. Text clustering involves categorizing and grouping similar content. It is a process of identifying significant patterns from unstructured textual data. Algorithms are being developed globally to extract useful and relevant information from large amounts of text data. Measuring the significance of content in documents to partition the collection of text data is one of the most important obstacles in text clustering. This study suggests utilizing an improved metaheuristics algorithm to fine-tune the K-means approach for text clustering task. The suggested technique is evaluated using the first 30 unconstrained test functions from the CEC2017 test-suite and six standard criterion text datasets. The simulation results and comparison with existing techniques demonstrate the robustness and supremacy of the suggested method.

AB  - Text pre-processing is an important component of a Chinese text classification. At present, however, most of the studies on this topic focus on exploring the influence of preprocessing methods on a few text classification algorithms using English text. In this paper we experimentally compared fifteen commonly used classifiers on two Chinese datasets using three widely used Chinese preprocessing methods that include word segmentation, Chinese specific stop word removal, and Chinese specific symbol removal. We then explored the influence of the preprocessing methods on the final classifications according to various conditions such as classification evaluation, combination style, and classifier selection. Finally, we conducted a battery of various additional experiments, and found that most of the classifiers improved in performance after proper preprocessing was applied. Our general conclusion is that the systematic use of preprocessing methods can have a positive impact on the classification of Chinese short text, using classification evaluation such as macro-F1, combination of preprocessing methods such as word segmentation, Chinese specific stop word and symbol removal, and classifier selection such as machine and deep learning models. We find that the best macro-f1s for categorizing text for the two datasets are 92.13% and 91.99%, which represent improvements of 0.3% and 2%, respectively over the compared baselines.

AB  - A division of artificial intelligence known as natural language processing is thought to be a rapidly developing subject. NLP methods enable computers to comprehend human words and translate unstructured data for use by systems. The Dimensions database, which contains papers on natural language processing from 2002 to 2021, is thoroughly examined bibliometrically in this paper. It is the first attempt to perform bibliometric analysis in the NLP area in Dimensions database papers. The information is examined using bibliometric growth indicators, such as growth rate, relative growth rate, doubling time, degree of collaboration, and collaboration index. In addition, the VOSviewer software is used to create bibliometric networks. The primary purposes of this research study include detecting the NLP development pattern, discovering the distribution of co-authorship, influential authors, productive geographical distribution, keyword analysis, highly cited publications, finding recent research hotspots, and determining future research directions based on the challenges that exist in each of the research trends.

AB  - The Internet of Things generates vast data volumes via diverse sensors, yet its potential remains unexploited for innovative data-driven products and services. Limitations arise from sensor-dependent data handling by manufacturers and user companies, hindering third-party access and comprehension. Initiatives like the European Data Act aim to enable high-quality access to sensor-generated data by regulating accuracy, completeness, and relevance while respecting intellectual property rights. Despite data availability, interoperability challenges impede sensor data reusability. For instance, sensor data shared in HTML formats requires an intricate, time-consuming processing to attain reusable formats like JSON or XML. This study introduces a methodology aimed at converting raw sensor data extracted from web portals into structured formats, thereby enhancing data reusability. The approach utilises large language models to derive structured formats from sensor data initially presented in non-interoperable formats. The effectiveness of these language models was assessed through quantitative and qualitative evaluations in a use case involving meteorological data. In the proposed experiments, GPT-4, the best performing LLM tested, demonstrated the feasibility of this methodology, achieving a precision of 93.51% and a recall of 85.33% in converting HTML to JSON/XML, thus confirming its potential in obtaining reusable sensor data.

AB  - This manuscript provides a comprehensive exploration of Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA), highlighting its strengths, drawbacks, and challenges. The PLSA, originally a tool for information retrieval, provides a probabilistic sense for a table of co-occurrences as a mixture of multinomial distributions spanned over a latent class variable and adjusted with the expectation–maximization algorithm. The distributional assumptions and the iterative nature lead to a rigid model, dividing enthusiasts and detractors. Those drawbacks have led to several reformulations: the extension of the method to normal data distributions and a non-parametric formulation obtained with the help of Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) techniques. Furthermore, the combination of theoretical studies and programming techniques alleviates the computational problem, thus making the potential of the method explicit: its relation with the Singular value decomposition (SVD), which means that PLSA can be used to satisfactorily support other techniques, such as the construction of Fisher kernels, the probabilistic interpretation of Principal component analysis (PCA), Transfer learning (TL), and the training of neural networks, among others. We also present open questions as a practical and theoretical research window.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce a multi-label lazy learning approach to deal with automatic semantic indexing in large document collections in the presence of complex and structured label vocabularies with high inter-label correlation. The proposed method is an evolution of the traditional k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm which uses a large autoencoder trained to map the large label space to a reduced size latent space and to regenerate the predicted labels from this latent space. We have evaluated our proposal in a large portion of the MEDLINE biomedical document collection which uses the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus as a controlled vocabulary. In our experiments we propose and evaluate several document representation approaches and different label autoencoder configurations.

AB  - Abstract As code is now an inextricable part of science it should be supported by competent Software Engineering, analogously to statistical claims being properly supported by competent statistics. If and when code avoids adequate scrutiny, science becomes unreliable and unverifiable because results — text, data, graphs, images, etc — depend on untrustworthy code. Currently, scientists rarely assure the quality of the code they rely on, and rarely make it accessible for scrutiny. Even when available, scientists rarely provide adequate documentation to understand or use it reliably. This paper proposes and justifies ways to improve science using code: 1. Professional Software Engineers can help, particularly in critical fields such as public health, climate change and energy. 2. ‘Software Engineering Boards,’ analogous to Ethics or Institutional Review Boards, should be instigated and used. 3. The Reproducible Analytic Pipeline (RAP) methodology can be generalized to cover code and Software Engineering methodologies, in a generalization this paper introduces called RAP+. RAP+ (or comparable interventions) could be supported and or even required in journal, conference and funding body policies. The paper’s Supplemental Material provides a summary of Software Engineering best practice relevant to scientific research, including further suggestions for RAP+ workflows. ‘Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer.’ Donald E.

AB  - Abstract How the knowledge base of disciplines grows, renews, and decays informs their distinct characteristics and epistemology. Here we track the evolution of knowledge bases of 19 disciplines for over 45 years. We introduce the notation of knowledge inheritance as the overlap in the set of references between years. We discuss two modes of knowledge inheritance of disciplines—successive and distant. To quantify the status and propensity of knowledge inheritance for disciplines, we propose two indicators: one descriptively describes knowledge base evolution, and one estimates the propensity of knowledge inheritance. When observing the continuity in knowledge bases for disciplines, we show distinct patterns for STEM and SS&amp;H disciplines: the former inherits knowledge bases more successively, yet the latter inherits significantly from distant knowledge bases. We further discover stagnation or revival in knowledge base evolution where older knowledge base ceases to decay after 10 years (e.g., Physics and Mathematics) and are increasingly reused (e.g., Philosophy). Regarding the propensity of inheriting prior knowledge bases, we observe unanimous rises in both successive and distant knowledge inheritance. We show that knowledge inheritance could reveal disciplinary characteristics regarding the trajectory of knowledge base evolution and interesting insights into the metabolism and maturity of scholarly communication.

AB  - Recent advances in weakly supervised text classification mostly focus on designing sophisticated methods to turn high-level human heuristics into quality pseudo-labels. In this paper, we revisit the seed matching-based method, which is arguably the simplest way to generate pseudo-labels, and show that its power was greatly underestimated. We show that the limited performance of seed matching is largely due to the label bias injected by the simple seed-match rule, which prevents the classifier from learning reliable confidence for selecting high-quality pseudo-labels. Interestingly, simply deleting the seed words present in the matched input texts can mitigate the label bias and help learn better confidence. Subsequently, the performance achieved by seed matching can be improved significantly, making it on par with or even better than the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, to handle the case when the seed words are not made known, we propose to simply delete the word tokens in the input text randomly with a high deletion ratio. Remarkably, seed matching equipped with this random deletion method can often achieve even better performance than that with seed deletion.

AB  - Extreme multi-label classification problems occur in different applications such as prediction of tags or advertisements. We propose a new algorithm that predicts labels using a linear ensemble of labels from instance- and feature-based nearest neighbours. In the feature-based nearest neighbours method, we precompute a matrix containing the similarities between each feature and label. For the instance-based nearest neighbourhood, we create an algorithm that uses an inverted index to compute cosine similarity on sparse datasets efficiently. We extend this baseline with a new top-k query algorithm that combines term-at-a-time and document-at-a-time traversal with tighter pruning based on a partition of the dataset. On ten real-world datasets, we find that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as multi-label k-nearest neighbours, instance-based logistic regression, binary relevance with support vector machines and FastXml on different evaluation metrics. We also find that our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than these baseline algorithms on sparse datasets and requires less than 20 ms per instance to predict labels for extreme datasets without the need for expensive hardware.

AB  - Although previous studies of today’s globalised and competitive research landscape have mentioned the research collaborations of CANZUK countries (i.e., Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom), none have yet studied them in detail. Further, such studies have used different measures of international research collaboration (IRC), resulting in disparate findings. This paper, therefore, analyses the strengths of CANZUK research collaborations, how those collaborations have changed over time, and assesses the effect of three ways of measures on the results (absolute strength, bilateral similarity, and multilateral similarity). We provide a detailed characterisation of the CANZUK research network and its relationships with partner countries, which reveals that the most collaborative CANZUK countries are the UK and Australia, among other findings. We also confirm that many findings differ depending on which measures are used. We offer an explanation of this difference with reference to the nature of the measures (i.e., what they really measure) and make suggestions for suitable measures in future studies depending on their purpose. Finally, we discuss how this study’s findings can be used by research policy makers (in CANZUK and elsewhere) in deciding on research strategy and by researchers in appropriately measuring IRC.

AB  - Reproducibility is widely acknowledged as a fundamental principle in scientific research. Currently, the scientific community grapples with numerous challenges associated with reproducibility, often referred to as the ''reproducibility crisis.'' This crisis permeated numerous scientific disciplines. In this study, we examined the factors in scientific practices that might contribute to this lack of reproducibility. Significant focus is placed on the prevalent integration of computation in research, which can sometimes function as a black box in published papers. Our study primarily focuses on highperformance computing (HPC), which presents unique reproducibility challenges. This paper provides a comprehensive review of these concerns and potential solutions. Furthermore, we discuss the critical role of reproducible research in advancing science and identifying persisting issues within the field of HPC.

AB  - University–industry partnerships are rare on the humanities side of campus in contrast to the sciences. As a result, little is known about these partnerships, which tend to be with libraries and other not-for-profit organizations. Using the Implementing New Knowledge Environments: Network Open Social Scholarship (INKE:NOSS) as a case study, this research examines a humanities-based university–industry partnership from the academics’ perspective. It explores the nature of the collaboration, associated benefits and challenges, and measures of success and desired outcomes. Overall, building upon several years of working with the partners, the interviewed researchers found that the benefits of collaborating outweighed the challenges. The benefits included the potential to move research towards production-orientated results. Among the many challenges, there was some hesitation about the ability to achieve publications and presentations needed for tenure and promotion. The academics contributed students, and in-kind and cash resources from their own research funds and those of the university to the partnership. At this point, the measures of success and desirable outcomes have not been quantified and instead focus on policy intervention and movement towards open social scholarship. These understandings about the nature of such a university–industry collaboration should provide a good foundation if partnership is funded.

AB  - Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a common approach to learning predictive models using not only labeled, but also unlabeled examples. While SSL for the simple tasks of classification and regression has received much attention from the research community, this is not the case for complex prediction tasks with structurally dependent variables, such as multi-label classification and hierarchical multi-label classification. These tasks may require additional information, possibly coming from the underlying distribution in the descriptive space provided by unlabeled examples, to better face the challenging task of simultaneously predicting multiple class labels. In this paper, we investigate this aspect and propose a (hierarchical) multi-label classification method based on semi-supervised learning of predictive clustering trees, which we also extend towards ensemble learning. Extensive experimental evaluation conducted on 24 datasets shows significant advantages of the proposed method and its extension with respect to their supervised counterparts. Moreover, the method preserves interpretability of classical tree-based models.

AB  - Requirements for the analysis, interpretation and reuse of information are becoming more and more ambitious as we generate larger and more complex datasets. This is leading to the development and widespread use of information about information, often called metainformation (or metadata) in most disciplines. The Digital Humanities are not an exception. We often assume that metainformation helps us in documenting information for future reference by recording who has created it, when and how, among other aspects. We also assume that recording metainformation will facilitate the tasks of interpreting information at later stages. However, some works have identified some issues with existing metadata approaches, related to 1) the proliferation of too many “standards” and difficulties to choose between them; 2) the generalized assumption that metadata and data (or metainformation and information) are essentially different, and the subsequent development of separate sets of languages and tools for each (introducing redundant models); and 3) the combination of conceptual and implementation concerns within most approaches, violating basic engineering principles of modularity and separation of concerns. Some of these problems are especially relevant in Digital Humanities. In addition, we argue here that the lack of characterization of the scenarios in which metainformation plays a relevant role in humanistic projects often results in metainformation being recorded and managed without a specific purpose in mind. In turn, this hinders the process of decision making on issues such as what metainformation must be recorded in a specific project, and how it must be conceptualized, stored and managed. This paper presents a review of the most used metadata approaches in Digital Humanities and, taking a conceptual modelling perspective, analyses their major issues as outlined above. It also describes what the most common scenarios for the use of metainformation in Digital Humanities are, presenting a characterization that can assist in the setting of goals for metainformation recording and management in each case. Based on these two aspects, a new approach is proposed for the conceptualization, recording and management of metainformation in the Digital Humanities, using the ConML conceptual modelling language, and adopting the overall view that metainformation is not essentially different to information. The proposal is validated in Digital Humanities scenarios through case studies employing real-world datasets.

AB  - Abstract Multi-label text classification (MLTC) is a popular method for organizing electronic documents, which is crucial for accessing and processing data. As the number of classes increases, learning multi-label data will be challenging. The number of possible states for various labels increases exponentially, and learning algorithms in single-label data cannot be used to solve these problems. In the meantime, using single-label data algorithms could be very time-consuming. In MLTC, complexity costs should be reduced. Deep-learning neural networks that can learn intricate patterns are used in many real-world problems because of their high power and accuracy. This paper proposed a hybridization of the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and the convolutional neural network (CNN) method for MLTC. The proposed model uses LSTM to enhance CNN to improve the proposed model’s accuracy. Also, the competitive search algorithm (CSA) is used to improve the LSTM hyperparameters. The LSTM hyperparameters play an important role in increasing the detection accuracy. The CSA algorithm finds the best values for the hyperparameters by searching the problem space. It was tested on four different datasets of multi-label texts: Reuters-21578, RCV1-v2, EUR-Lex, and Bookmarks. The result showed that the proposed model performed better than CNN and LSTM-CSA in terms of accuracy percentage and that it has improved by an average of more than 10%. Also, the results show that the LSTM-CSA model has higher detection accuracy compared to LSTM—Gradient-based optimizer (GBO) and LSTM—whale optimization algorithm (WOA).

AB  - Abstract Recently, the topic of research data management has appeared at the forefront of Open Science as a prerequisite for preserving and disseminating research data efficiently. At the same time, scientific laboratories still rely upon digital files that are processed by experimenters to analyze and communicate laboratory results. In this study, we first apply a forensic process to investigate the information quality of digital evidence underlying published results. Furthermore, we use semiotics to describe the quality of information recovered from storage systems with laboratory forensics techniques. Next, we formulate laboratory analytics capabilities based on the results of the forensics analysis. Laboratory forensics and analytics form the basis of research data management. Finally, we propose a conceptual overview of open science readiness, which combines laboratory forensics techniques and laboratory analytics capabilities to help overcome research data management challenges in the near future.

AB  - Like other mining, web mining is also necessary to increase the power of web search engine to identify the intended web page and web document. While processing with large datasets, there arises several issues associated with space availability, similarity relationships between different webpage’s and running time. Hence, this paper intends to develop an enhanced web mining model based on two contributions. At first, the hierarchical tree is framed, which produces different categories of the searching queries (different web pages). Next, to hierarchical tree model, enhanced Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) technique model is developed by modifying the traditional DBSCAN. This technique results in proper session identification from raw data. Moreover, this technique offers the optimal level of clusters necessitated for hierarchical clustering. After hierarchical clustering, the rule mining is adopted. The traditional rule mining technique is generally based on the frequency; however, this paper intends to enhance the traditional rule mining based on utility factor as the second contribution. Hence the proposed model for web rule mining is termed as Enhanced DBSCAN-based Hierarchical Tree (EDBHT). It benefits in providing the search results depending on high level information (e.g., location), so that the ability of search engine in providing the interesting association rules can be improved. Next, to the implementation, the performance of proposed EDBHT is found to be enhanced when compared over several traditional models.

AB  - Bit-stream recognition (BSR) has a wide range of applications, including forensic investigations, detecting copyright infringement, and analyzing malware.In order to analyze file fragments recovered by digital forensics, it is necessary to use a BSR method that can accurately classify classes while addressing various domains without preprocessing the raw input bitstream.For example, it is important to note that in the case of compiler provenance recovery, a type of BSR, the same bit sequence can have different meanings for different CPU architectures.As a result, traditional methods that rely heavily on disassembly tools, such as IDA Pro, may have limited in applicaballity scope to programs designed for specific CPU architecture.To address the aforementioned limitation, we proposed a novel learning method.Our method involves the upstream layers (sub-net) capturing global features and instructing the downstream layers (main-net) to shift focus, even when a portion of the input bit-stream has identical values.Through our experiments, we utilized a model that was less than 1/300 the size of the state-of-the-art model.Despite its smaller size, our method achieved the highest classification performance of 99.54 on a multi-CPU architecture, outperforming existing methods.

AB  - We present FewShotTextGCN, a novel method designed to effectively utilize the properties of word-document graphs for improved learning in low-resource settings. We introduce K-hop Neighbourhood Regularization, a regularizer for heterogeneous graphs, and show that it stabilizes and improves learning when only a few training samples are available. We furthermore propose a simplification in the graph-construction method, which results in a graph that is ∼7 times less dense and yields better performance in little-resource settings while performing on par with the state of the art in high-resource settings. Finally, we introduce a new variant of Adaptive Pseudo-Labeling tailored for word-document graphs. When using as little as 20 samples for training, we outperform a strong TextGCN baseline with 17% in absolute accuracy on average over eight languages. We demonstrate that our method can be applied to document classification without any language model pretraining on a wide range of typologically diverse languages while performing on par with large pretrained language models.

AB  - This article describes a new bibliometric indicator called Impact Factor of a Term (IFT) that helps to predict future impact of scientific works and/or the author. The predictive properties of IFT are proven by two examples of different collections of scientific articles. It is shown that the correlations of the current and future IFT values depending on the trend are practically similar for both collections. The graphs of IFT correlations of the current and future years depending on the number of articles with the word/term are presented. The graphs show that the higher the current frequency of the term and the number of articles with this term, the greater the correlation and stability of IFT. The stability of IFT helps to accurately predict the number of future citations. The list of the most informative words/terms with the largest total values of IFT multiplied by the current frequency is analyzed. It has been shown that the size of collection affects the stability and predictive properties of IFT. The words and terms with high IFT values allow us to judge the future impact of an article and its author based on the prediction of future citations. Such words also help identify promising research directions.

The main learning task from such data is multilabel classification, where the goal is to output a bipartition of the target variables into relevant and irrelevant ones for a given instance. Other tasks involve ranking the target variables from the most to the least relevant one or even outputting a full joint distribution for every possible assignment of values to the binary targets.

AB  - Hadith is the term used to describe the narration of the sayings and actions of Prophet Mohammad (p.b.u.h.). The study of Hadith can be modeled into a pipeline of tasks performed on a collection of textual data. Although many attempts have been made for developing Hadith search engines, existing solutions are repetitive, text-based, and manually annotated. This research documents 6 Hadith Retrieval methods, discusses their limitations, and introduces 2 methods for robust narrative retrieval. Namely, we address the challenge of user needs by reformulating the problem in a two-fold solution: declarative knowledge-graph querying; and semantic-similarity classification for Takhreej groups retrieving. The classifier was built by fine-tuning an AraBERT transformer model on a 200k pairs sample and scored 90% recall and precision. This work demonstrated how the Hadith Retrieval could be more ef icient and insightful with a user-centered methodology, which is an under-explored area with high potential.

AB  - The influence of interdisciplinary research has become a trending topic in library and information science. However, research examining the influence of interdisciplinarity on scholars is still limited. This current study examines the interdisciplinarity from the author co-citation network approach. We focus on the field of social networking sites (SNS) research, namely studies about online platforms that people use for networking (e.g., Facebook), and examine whether interdisciplinarity would promote academic impact. About 2,489 articles in the field of SNS published from 2014 to 2016 were retrieved, with 611 first authors cited by those articles identified. The interdisciplinarity of the scholar was assessed in the author co-citation networks using two indexes: betweenness centrality and constraint. We identified four primary disciplines of SNS research in 2014 to 2016. Interdisciplinarity indexes were used to predict the scholarly impact in this field in the next 3-year interval (2017–2019), measured by citation counts. We found that citation number was predicted by betweenness centrality but not by constraint. Theoretical and practical implications of interdisciplinarity in research activities are discussed.

AB  - Text classification is one of the most fundamental tasks in text data analysis. Generally, textual data are extensive in scale and complex in the inherent relationship, leading to low accuracy in traditional classification models. This paper proposes a multi-label classification model based on multi-layer neural network architecture. We first construct a dual-attention mechanism graph neural network (named DGAT for short) to fuse the typological and informational features of the target node and the connected nodes. Secondly, we also build a multi-layer network architecture with multiple DGATs to expand the range of neighborhood nodes participating in the feature fusion to meet the needs of classifying different datasets. To ensure the learning ability of the model, we also use the residual network to solve the problem of error rise and gradient descent caused by multi-layer network architecture. Finally, we conducted a large number of experiments on five benchmark datasets. The results show that the accuracy of the proposed model is significantly better than that of the traditional models, and that there is a noticeable improvement when compared with other deep learning methods.

AB  - Collaborator recommendation is a crucial topic in research management. This paper proposes a Novelty-Oriented Scientific Research Collaborator recommendation model (NovSRC). By recommending collaborators under the guidance of novel indicators, NovSRC aims to broaden scholars' research perspectives and facilitate the progress of research innovation. NovSRC utilizes heterogeneous academic networks composed of different academic entities and their relationships to learn vector representations of scholars and quantify their novelty metrics. A weighted academic collaboration network was constructed by measuring the novelty collaboration strength (NCS) among scholars under the novelty index, and based on this network, the final vector representation of scholars under the guidance of novelty characteristics was learned. By calculating the similarity between scholar vectors, NovSRC generates a Top-N recommendation list with a focus on novelty. The experimental results indicate that NovSRC achieved the best recommendation performance. Compared with the baseline models, the recommendation precision of NovSRC has improved by 6.9%, the F1 value has increased by 17.3%, and the novelty collaboration strength among scholars has increased by 3.3%. The analysis of the recommended list shows that compared to the target scholars, scholars recommended by the NovSRC model exhibit a wider distribution of research interests, which confirms that novelty has become a key benchmark factor for scholars seeking collaborators.

First, expanding the existing taxonomy of article contribution, we examine trends in theory testing, theory building, and new method development within the journal’s articles. We find that the journal demands a high level of theoretical contribution and methodological rigor. High levels of theoretical and methodological contribution become significant predictors of article citation rates. Second, we look at the composition of the studies in Network Science and determine that the journal has already established a solid “hard core” for the new discipline.

AB  - There has been a meteoric rise in the total amount of digital texts as a direct result of the proliferation of internet access. As a direct result of this, document clustering has evolved into a crucial method that must be used in order to successfully extract relevant information from big document collections. When employing the document clustering approach, documents are automatically sorted into groups whose members have a high degree of similarity to one another. These groups are created by applying the document clustering technique. Because they do not take into account the semantic linkages that exist between the texts, traditional clustering approaches are unable to provide an acceptable description of a collection of texts. This is because traditional clustering techniques. Document clusters, in which texts are ordered according to their meaning rather than their use of keywords, have been extensively utilized as a means of overcoming these challenges as a result of the incorporation of semantic information. This has been possible as a result of the fact that document clusters can group together related texts. In this investigation, we looked at a total of 27 distinct papers that were published over the previous five years and categorized the documents based on the semantic similarities that existed between the various pieces. A detailed literature evaluation is included to each and every one of the publications that were selected for further consideration. Comparative research is carried out on a wide variety of evaluation strategies, including as algorithms, similarity metrics, instruments, and processes. Following that, there is a drawn-out discussion that analyzes the similarities and differences between the activities.&#x0D; &#x0D;

AB  - Scientific networks are often investigated by means of citation analyses. Yet, interpretation of such networks in terms of semantic (and often disciplinary) content heavily depends on supplementary knowledge, notably about author research specialties. Similar situations arise more generally in many types of social networks whose semantic interpretation relies on supplementary information. Here, author community net-works are inferred from a topic model which provides direct insights into the semantic specificity of the identified “hidden communities of interest” (HCoI). Using a philosophy of science corpus of full-text articles (N=16,917), we investigate its underlying communities by measuring topic profile correlations be-tween authors. A diachronic perspective is built by modeling the research networks over different time-periods and mapping genealogical relationships be-tween communities. The results show a marked in-crease in philosophy of science communities over time and trace the progressive appearance of the specialization areas that structure the field today.

AB  - Search engines are among the most popular web services on the World Wide Web. They facilitate the process of finding information using a query-result mechanism. However, results returned by search engines contain many duplications. In this paper, we introduce a new content-type-based similarity computation method to address this problem. Our approach divides the webpage into different types of content, such as title, subtitles, body, etc. Then, we find for each type a suitable similarity measure. Next, we add the different calculated similarity scores to get the final similarity score between the two documents, using a weighted formula. Finally, we suggest a new graph-based algorithm to cluster search results according to their similarity. We empirically evaluated our results with the Agglomerative Clustering, and we achieved about 61% reduction in web pages, 0.2757 Silhouette coefficient, 0.1269 Davies Bouldin Score, and 85 Calinski Harabasz Score.

AB  - With the rise of neural networks, studies on text classification have transitioned from traditional methods to deep learning, especially to graph neural networks on text graphs constructed from corpora.In this paper, we model the complex instances and rich interactions in text classification as a heterogeneous graph.Nevertheless, due to the overlook of indirect relations between documents, graph neural networks have not been fully exploited for the heterogeneous text graph with different types of nodes and links.Consequently, we propose a Meta-Path-based Text Graph Neural Network (MPTGNN) for text classification.Specifically, we first construct a heterogeneous text graph from corpora; we then transform the text graph into several homogeneous weighted graphs via some pre-defined metapaths; we also propose a Two-stage Multi-graph Information Fusion method (TMIF) for document representation.Empirical results on multiple benchmark datasets have proved that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art graph-based methods like Text GCN.

AB  - The primary aim of this study was to investigate the structure and dynamics of current research in personality psychology, with a particular focus on open access (OA) practices. A set of 57296 research articles in personality psychology indexed in the Scopus database were analyzed based on their online accessibility: closed (39523), green OA (8770), gold OA (4506), bronze OA (2704), and hybrid gold OA (1793). Although the proportion of OA articles in the overall sample was relatively modest (31%), there has been a consistent upward trend since 2012. Notably, the most significant increase was observed in the proportion of gold OA articles, whereas the number of deposited articles (green OA), not otherwise freely available online, experienced a decline. The knowledge domain of non-OA articles in personality psychology can be broadly delineated into five clusters: (Big Five) personality traits, personality disorders, emotion regulation, Dark Triad/Tetrad, and psychometrics. The emergence of COVID-19 as a “hot” research topic resulted with significant differences in the knowledge domain of non-OA and OA articles. Co-authorship network analysis revealed that authors from Western countries act as the central hub in personality research, though this centrality diminishes when only gold OA articles were taken into account. Gold OA articles performed the worst on most impact and outreach metrics except one, significantly surpassed by green OA articles. As a takeaway, it may be said that although you may need a significant amount of money to do the research, you don’t need it to make your research open and make an impact.

AB  - Many scientific experiments are modeled as workflows. Workflows usually output massive amounts of data. To guarantee the reproducibility of workflows, they are usually orchestrated by Workflow Management Systems (WfMS), that capture provenance data. Provenance represents the lineage of a data fragment throughout its transformations by activities in a workflow. Provenance traces are usually represented as graphs. These graphs allows scientists to analyze and evaluate results produced by a workflow. However, each WfMS has a proprietary format for provenance and do it in different granularity levels. Therefore, in more complex scenarios in which the scientist needs to interpret provenance graphs generated by multiple WfMSs and workflows, a challenge arises. To first understand the research landscape, we conduct a Systematic Literature Mapping, assessing existing solutions under several different lenses. With a clearer understanding of the state of the art, we propose a tool called Polyflow, which is based on the concept of Polystore systems, integrating several databases of heterogeneous origin by adopting a global ProvONE schema. Polyflow allows scientists to query multiple provenance graphs in an integrated way. Polyflow was evaluated by experts using provenance data collected from real experiments that generate phylogenetic trees through workflows. The experiment results suggest that Polyflow is a viable solution for interoperating heterogeneous provenance data generated by different WfMSs, from both a usability and performance standpoint.

AB  - Abstract Scientific research is driven by allocation of funding to different research projects based in part on the predicted scientific impact of the work. Data-driven algorithms can inform decision-making of scarce funding resources by identifying likely high-impact studies using bibliometrics. Compared to standardized citation-based metrics alone, we utilize a machine learning pipeline that analyzes high-dimensional relationships among a range of bibliometric features to improve the accuracy of predicting high-impact research. Random forest classification models were trained using 28 bibliometric features calculated from a dataset of 1,485,958 publications in medicine to retrospectively predict whether a publication would become high-impact. For each random forest model, the balanced accuracy score was above 0.95 and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was above 0.99. The high performance of high impact research prediction using our proposed models show that machine learning technologies are promising algorithms that can support funding decision-making for medical research.

AB  - In many real-life systems, the interactions among entities are complex and varied. This necessitates the use of a multiplex graph model with heterogeneous layers of graphs to effectively describe these interactions. The current paper focuses on incorporating high-order relations, specifically inter-layer couplings or connections, in multiplex graph learning. Through developing a high-order smoothness criterion, we propose an algorithm that integrates inter-layer connections to perform inference from multi-attribute graph signals. We show that it is essential to consider high-order interactions in the inference process. We validate our claims through numerical experiments, demonstrating their efficacy in capturing the intricate relationships within multiplex networks.

AB  - The fusion of machine learning and biomedical research offers novel ways to understand, diagnose, and treat various health conditions. However, the complexities of biomedical data, coupled with the intricate process of developing and deploying machine learning solutions, often pose significant challenges to researchers in these fields. Our pivotal achievement in this research is the introduction of the Automatic Semantic Machine Learning Microservice (AIMS) framework. AIMS addresses these challenges by automating various stages of the machine learning pipeline, with a particular emphasis on the ontology of machine learning services tailored to the biomedical domain. This ontology encompasses everything from task representation, service modeling, and knowledge acquisition to knowledge reasoning and the establishment of a self-supervised learning policy. Our framework has been crafted to prioritize model interpretability, integrate domain knowledge effortlessly, and handle biomedical data with efficiency. Additionally, AIMS boasts a distinctive feature: it leverages self-supervised knowledge learning through reinforcement learning techniques, paired with an ontology-based policy recording schema. This enables it to autonomously generate, fine-tune, and continually adapt to machine learning models, especially when faced with new tasks and data. Our work has two standout contributions demonstrating that machine learning processes in the biomedical domain can be automated, while integrating a rich domain knowledge base and providing a way for machines to have self-learning ability, ensuring they handle new tasks effectively. To showcase AIMS in action, we have highlighted its prowess in three case studies of biomedical tasks. These examples emphasize how our framework can simplify research routines, uplift the caliber of scientific exploration, and set the stage for notable advances.

AB  - The proliferation of Massive Open Online Courses has made it a challenge for the user to select a proper course. We assume a situation in which the user has targeted on the knowledge defined by some knowledge categories. Then, knowing how much of the knowledge in the category is covered by the courses will be helpful in the course selection. In this study, we define a concept of knowledge category coverage and aim to estimate it in a semi-automatic manner. We first model the knowledge category and the course as a set of concepts, and then utilize a taxonomy and the idea of centrality to differentiate the importance of concepts. Finally, we obtain the coverage value by calculating how much of the concepts required in a knowledge category is also taught in a course. Compared with treating the concepts uniformly important, we found that our proposed method can effectively generate closer coverage values to the ground truth assigned by domain experts.

AB  - In academia, it is rare for an event or issue to foster the extensive participation of multiple disciplines. Research related to COVID-19 has undeniably yielded a wealth of valuable insights and impetus for the progress of interdisciplinary research, encompassing concepts, methodologies, intellectual approaches, theories, frameworks, data integration and analysis, and pertinent considerations. In the academic community, there is a widespread expectation that as science and technology continue to progress, the convergence of medicine with various other fields will gain momentum. Fields like computer science are anticipated to see expanded applications in domains such as medicine, vaccine research, disease diagnosis, and more. This study aims to examine interdisciplinary approaches in health-related research, particularly in the context of COVID-19. The goal is to analyze and comprehend the involvement and collaboration patterns of various disciplines in pandemic research, with a specific emphasis on the role and integration level of computer science. This study analyzed 240,509 COVID-19 related articles published from December 2019 to September 2022 using methods such as chord diagrams, modularity analysis, and eigenvector centrality analysis in Social Networking Analysis (SNA). The findings revealed an emerging trend of integration trend between Humanities &amp; Social Sciences and Natural Sciences. Expectations that computer science would prominently feature in pandemic research during this technology-driven era haven’t materialized. While it maintains links with engineering, it hasn’t formed strong connections with medicine. This indicates a gap between computer science and core medical research in large-scale health crises, where COVID-19 research remains centered on medicine with varying interdisciplinary collaboration, and high-tech disciplines like computer science have not achieved their expected influence in these studies.

AB  - Node of network has lots of information, such as topology, text and label information.Therefore, node classification is an open issue.Recently, one vector of node is directly connected at the end of another vector.However, this method actually obtains the performance by extending dimensions and considering that the text and structural information are one-to-one, which is obviously unreasonable.Regarding this issue, a method by weighting vectors is proposed in this paper.Three methods, negative logarithm, modulus and sigmoid function are used to weight-trained vectors, then recombine the weighted vectors and put them into the SVM classifier for evaluation output.By comparing three different weighting methods, the results showed that using negative logarithm weighting achieved better results than the other two using modulus and sigmoid function weighting, and was superior to directly concatenating vectors in the same dimension.

AB  - Scientometrics is a quantitative and statistical approach that analyzes research on certain themes. It originated from information/library science but has been applied in various disciplines, including information science, library science, natural science, technology, engineering, medical sciences, and social sciences and humanities. Numerous scientometric studies have been carried out, but no study has attempted to investigate the overall research status of scientometrics. The objective of this study was to investigate the research status of scientometrics based on 16,225 publications archived in the Web of Science Core Collection between 1992 and 2020. The results show that there has been a marked increase in publications on scientometric studies over the past decades, with “Information Science Library Science” being the predominant discipline publishing scientometric studies, but scientometrics has been widely adopted in a variety of other disciplines (240 of 254 Web of Science categories). It was found that Web of Science, Vosviewer, and Scientometrics are the most utilized database, software, and journal for scientometric studies, respectively. The most productive author (Lutz Bornmann from the Max Planck Society, Germany), organization (University of Granada, Spain), and country (USA) are also identified. In addition, high-impact scientometric studies and the research landscape are analyzed through citation networks and the co-occurrence of keywords method.

AB  - Forecasting citations of scientific patents and publications is a crucial task for understanding the evolution and development of technological domains and for foresight into emerging technologies. By construing citations as a time series, the task can be cast into the domain of temporal point processes. Most existing work on forecasting with temporal point processes, both conventional and neural network-based, only performs single-step forecasting. In citation forecasting, however, the more salient goal is n -step forecasting: predicting the arrival of the next n citations. In this article, we propose Dynamic Multi-Context Attention Networks (DMA-Nets), a novel deep learning sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model with a novel hierarchical dynamic attention mechanism for long-term citation forecasting. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model learns better representations of conditional dependencies over historical sequences compared to state-of-the-art counterparts and thus achieves significant performance for citation predictions.

AB  - “Learning-to-rank” or LTR utilizes machine learning technologies to optimally combine many features to solve the problem of ranking. Web search is one of the prominent applications of LTR. To improve the ranking of webpages, multimodality based Learning to Rank model is proposed and implemented. Multimodality is the fusion or the process of integrating multiple unimodal representations into one compact representation. The main problem with the web search is that the links that appear on the top of the search list may be either irrelevant or less relevant to the user than the one appearing at a lower rank. Researches have proven that a multimodality based search would improve the rank list populated. The multiple modalities considered here are the text on a webpage as well as the images on a webpage. The textual features of the webpages are extracted from the LETOR dataset and the image features of the webpages are extracted from the images inside the webpages using the concept of transfer learning. VGG-16 model, pre-trained on ImageNet is used as the image feature extractor. The baseline model which is trained only using textual features is compared against the multimodal LTR. The multimodal LTR which integrates the visual and textual features shows an improvement of 10-15% in web search accuracy.

KW  - Text Classification
KW  - Document Categorization
KW  - Statistical classification
AB  - The importance of document classification has grown significantly in recent years, mostly due to the rise in digital data volumes. Since textual documents often contain more than 80% of all information, there is a perception that text mining has tremendous commercial potential. For future uses, knowledge extraction from these texts is essential. However, it is difficult to obtain this information due to the vast volume of files. As a re- sult, since text classification was introduced, the practice of classifying documents by text analysis has grown in significance. We have primarily employed three different algorithms to compare the metrics between them in order to assess the performance of various models. For this, the dataset was created by extracting condensed information from a variety of textbook genres, including business, social science, and computer science textbooks. To classify textbooks within the same subject group, we used three supervised machine learn- ing techniques in this study: decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. Among these three models, multilayer perceptron neural networks have performed and produced the best outcomes.

AB  - Abstract In the era of massive sharing of information, the term social provenance is used to denote the ownership, source or origin of a piece of information which has been propagated through social media. Tracking the provenance of information is becoming increasingly important as social platforms acquire more relevance as source of news. In this scenario, Twitter is considered one of the most important social networks for information sharing and dissemination which can be accelerated through the use of retweets and quotes. However, the Twitter API does not provide a complete tracking of the retweet chains, since only the connection between a retweet and the original post is stored, while all the intermediate connections are lost. This can limit the ability to track the diffusion of information as well as the estimation of the importance of specific users, who can rapidly become influencers, in the news dissemination. This paper proposes an innovative approach for rebuilding the possible chains of retweets and also providing an estimation of the contributions given by each user in the information spread. For this purpose, we define the concept of Provenance Constraint Network and a modified version of the Path Consistency Algorithm. An application of the proposed technique to a real-world dataset is presented at the end of the paper.

AB  - In this study, we examine and analyze the behavior of several graph-based models for Bangla text classification tasks. Graph-based algorithms create heterogeneous graphs from text data. Each node represents either a word or a document, and each edge indicates relationship between any two words or word and document. We applied the BERT model and different graph-based models including TextGCN, GAT, BertGAT, and BertGCN on five different datasets including SentNoB, Sarcasm detection, BanFakeNews, Hate speech detection, and Emotion detection datasets for Bangla text. BERT’s model bested the TextGCN and the GAT models by a large difference in terms of accuracy, Macro F1 score, and weighted F1 score. BertGCN and BertGAT are shown to outperform standalone graph models and BERT model. BertGAT excelled in the Emotion detection dataset and achieved a 1%-2% performance boost in Sarcasm detection, Hate speech detection, and BanFakeNews datasets from BERT’s performance. Whereas, BertGCN outperformed BertGAT by 1% for SetNoB, and BanFakeNews datasets while beating BertGAT by 2% for Sarcasm detection, Hate Speech, and Emotion detection datasets. We also examined different variations in graph structure and analyzed their effects.

AB  - Complex networks are a hot topic in social science research today. Analyzing the structure of the relationships embedded in them through community discovery techniques is an important tool for the study of complex networks. To address the randomness problem of label propagation in label propagation algorithms, this paper proposes an improved algorithm for label propagation based on rough kernels. The algorithm first performs the extraction of rough kernels and assigns unique labels to each rough kernel to achieve fast label preprocessing; then intervenes in the label propagation process through the ranking of node influence to reduce its randomness and make the division results more stable; finally, the community division is performed by the distribution of network labels. Experiments are conducted in real networks, and the results show that the combined performance of the method in this paper is better than the traditional labeling algorithm in terms of modularity and NMI metrics, and the proposed improved algorithm leads to improved community division results.

AB  - Label smoothing has a wide range of applications in the machine learning field. Nonetheless, label smoothing only softens the targets by adding a uniform distribution into a one-hot vector, which cannot truthfully reflect the underlying relations among categories. However, learning category relations is of vital importance in many fields such as emotion taxonomy and open set recognition. In this work, we propose a method to obtain the label distribution for each category (category distribution) to reveal category relations. Furthermore, based on the learned category distribution, we calculate new soft targets to improve the performance of model classification. Compared with existing methods, our algorithm can improve neural network models without any side information or additional neural network module by considering category relations. Extensive experiments have been conducted on four original datasets and 10 constructed noisy datasets with three basic neural network models to validate our algorithm. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on the classification task. In addition, three experiments (arrangement, clustering, and similarity) are also conducted to validate the intrinsic quality of the learned category distribution. The results indicate that the learned category distribution can well express underlying relations among categories.

AB  - Among various data analysis methods, classifier ensemble (data classification) and community network detection (data clustering) have aroused the interest of many scholars. The maximum operator, as the fusion function, was always used to fuse the results of the base algorithms in the classifier ensemble and the membership degree of nodes to classes in the fuzzy community. It is vital to use generalized fusion functions in ensemble and community applications. Since the Pseudo overlap function and the Choquet-like integrals are two new fusion functions, they can be combined as a more generalized fusion function. Along this line, this paper presents new classifier ensemble and fuzzy community detection methods using a pseudo overlap pair (POP) Choquet-like integral (expressed as a fraction). First, the pseudo overlap function pair is proposed to replace the product operator of the Choquet integral. Then, the POP Choquet-like integrals are defined to perform the combinatorial step of ensembles of classifiers and to generalize the GN modularity for the fuzzy community network. Finally, two new algorithms are designed for experiments, and some computational experiments with other algorithms show the importance of POP Choquet-like integrals. All of the experimental results show that our algorithms are practical.

AB  - Text classification is one of the classic tasks in the field of natural language processing. The goal is to identify the category to which the text belongs. Text categorization is widely used in email detection, sentiment analysis, topic marking and other fields. However, good text representation is the key to improve the performance of natural language processing tasks such as text classification. Traditional text representation adopts bag-of-words model or vector space model, which not only loses the context information of the text, but also faces the problems of high latitude and high sparsity. In recent years, with the increase of data and the improvement of computing performance, the use of deep learning technology to represent and classify texts has attracted great attention. Convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network and recurrent neural network with attention mechanism are used to represent the text, and then to classify the text and other natural language processing tasks, all of which have better performance than the traditional methods. In this paper, we design two sentence-level text representation and classification models based on the deep network. The details are as follows: (1) Text representation and classification model based on bidirectional cyclic and convolutional neural networks-BRCNN. Brcnn's input is the word vector corresponding to each word in the sentence; After using cyclic neural network to extract word order information in sentences, convolution neural network is used to extract higher-level features of sentences. After convolution, the maximum pool operation is used to obtain sentence vectors. At last, softmax classifier is used for classification. Cyclic neural network can capture the word order information in sentences, while convolutional neural network can extract useful features. Experiments on eight text classification tasks show that BRCNN model can get better text feature representation, and the classification accuracy rate is equal to or higher than that of the prior art.. (2) A text representation and classification model based on attention mechanism and convolutional neural network-ACNN. ACNN model uses the recurrent neural network with attention mechanism to obtain the context vector; Then convolution neural network is used to extract more advanced feature information. The maximum pool operation is adopted to obtain a sentence vector; At last, the softmax classifier is used to classify the text. Experiments on eight text classification benchmark data sets show that ACNN improves the stability of model convergence, and can converge to an optimal or local optimal solution better than BRCNN.

AB  - The message board text put forward by netizens on a certain issue is a suggestion or opinion, which is sparse and emotional. The traditional LDA model cannot solve the sparsity problem of the short message and ignores the emotional factor. In order to solve the above problems, a message board information extraction method based on LDA model and RNN model is proposed. First, eigenvalues are introduced to classify the text to solve the sparsity problem based on LDA model. Second, RNN model is used to realize the emotional features on the basis of message text vectorization. The experiment shows that the LDA model with eigenvalues has better topic extraction ability compared with the traditional model, and with the fusion of the RNN model, it can comprehensively display the potential information of the message text. As a result, the proposed method achieves information extraction maximize.

To address the correlation between labels, we leverage Graph Convolutional Networks and construct an adjacency matrix based on the statistical relations between labels. Additionally, we enhance recall ability by applying the Bhattacharyya distance to the output distributions of the set prediction networks. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on two multi-label datasets and demonstrate its superiority over previous baselines through experimental results.

AB  - The special text has a lot of features, such as professional words, abbreviations, large datasets, different themes, and uneven distribution of labels. While the existing text data mining classification methods use simple machine learning models, it has a bad performance on text classification. To solve this drawback, a text data mining algorithm based on convolutional neural network (CNN) model and deep Boltzmann machines (DBM) model is proposed in this paper. This method combines the CNN and DBM models with good feature extraction to realize the double feature extraction. It can realize the tag tree by constructing the tag tree and design the effective hierarchical network to achieve classification. At the same time, the model can suppress the input noise on the classification. Experimental results show that the improved algorithm achieves good classification results in special text data mining.

AB  - In mining, document clustering pretends to diminish the document size by constructing the clustering model which is extremely essential in various web-based applications. Over the past few decades, various mining approaches are analysed and evaluated to enhance the process of document clustering to attain better results; however, in most cases, the documents are messed up and degrade the performance by reducing the level of accuracy. The data instances need to be organized and a productive summary have to be generated for all clusters. The summary or the description of the document should demonstrate the information to the users’ devoid of any further analysis and helps in easier scanning of associated clusters. It is performed by identifying the relevant and most influencing features to generate the cluster. This work provides a novel approach known as Productive Feature Selection and Document Clustering (PFS-DocC) model. Initially, the productive features are selected from the input dataset DUC2004 which is a benchmark dataset. Next, the document clustering model is attempted for single and multiple clusters where the generated output has to be more extractive, generic, and clustering model. This model provides more appropriate and suitable summaries which is well-suited for web-based applications. The experimentation is carried out in online available benchmark dataset and the evaluation shows that the proposed PFS-DocC model gives superior outcomes with higher ROUGE score.

AB  - The Scopus database, which includes many open-access items, conference papers, funding details, and patent linkages, has developed as a vital resource within the dynamic social and economic environment. Gaining popularity in several fields, systematic reviews synthesize the relevant research literature in order to guide deliberative judgments. However, researchers require assistance in keeping up with the ever-increasing multidisciplinary nature of work and the ever-changing nature of information. Researchers need efficient methods to navigate and leverage the wealth of available knowledge for their systematic review processes as the number of scholarly production grows tremendously. This study employs descriptive statistics to examine and graphically present the bibliography (the list of sources cited in the text). This study was conducted in Dr. Jodi Schneider's lab and aims to identify trends in scholarly publishing and evaluate the overall content of scholarly works. Publication dates, item types, author lists, titles, and keywords are examined in the analysis, which takes CSV(Comma Separated Values), BibTeX, or RIS formats as input. Emerging research fields and patterns of collaboration can be better understood with the help of the descriptive statistics generated. Word clouds also help readers evaluate the quality and topic focus of the papers by providing a visual assessment of the paper's composition.

AB  - Text classification is a classical problem of natural language processing where given texts are classified into relevant classes. Text classification techniques are extensively used in finding news categories, search engine optimization, automated textual response and many more. With the exponential growth of digital data, it is inevitable that an automatic classification of documents is needed for efficient information retrieval and document archival. Over the years, text classification problems are approached by using classical machine learning techniques like naive bayes(NB), support vector machine(SVM), logistic regression(LR), random forest(RF) and others. In this article, an Attention based deep learning (DL) model is proposed and applied to the news corpus and then the results are compared with the results of classical machine learning models. A comparative analysis of classification accuracy of the DL model with prominent models like LR, RF and NB are presented in this work.

AB  - Collecting full annotations to construct multi-label datasets is difficult and labor-consuming. As an effective solution to relieve the annotation burden, single positive multi-label learning (SPML) draws increasing attention from both academia and industry. It only annotates each image with one positive label, leaving other labels unobserved. Therefore, existing methods strive to explore the cue of unobserved labels to compensate for the insufficiency of label supervision. Though achieving promising performance, they generally consider labels independently, leaving out the inherent hierarchical semantic relationship among labels which reveals that labels can be clustered into groups. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical prompt learning method with a novel Hierarchical Semantic Prompt Network (HSPNet) to harness such hierarchical semantic relationships using a large-scale pretrained vision and language model, i.e., CLIP, for SPML. We first introduce a Hierarchical Conditional Prompt (HCP) strategy to grasp the hierarchical label-group dependency. Then we equip a Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Network (HGCN) to capture the high-order inter-label and inter-group dependencies. Comprehensive experiments and analyses on several benchmark datasets show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, well demonstrating its superiority and effectiveness. Our code will be available at https://github.com/jameslahm/HSPNet.

AB  - Internet user-generated data, like Twitter, offers data scientists a public real-time data source that can provide insights, supplementing traditional data. However, identifying relevant data for such analyses can be time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce our Perplexity variant of Positive-Unlabelled Learning (PPUL) framework as a means to perform social media relevance filtering. We note that this task is particularly well suited to a PU Learning approach. We demonstrate how perplexity can identify candidate examples of the negative class, using language models. To learn such models, we experiment with both statistical methods and a Variational Autoencoder. Our PPUL method generally outperforms strong PU Learning baselines, which we demonstrate on five different data sets: the Hazardous Product Review data set, two well known social media data sets, and two real case studies in relevance filtering. All datasets have manual annotations for evaluation, and, in each case, PPUL attains state-of-the-art performance, with gains ranging from 4 to 17% improvement over competitive baselines. We show that the PPUL framework is effective when the amount of positive annotated data is small, and it is appropriate for both content that is triggered by an event and a general topic of interest.

AB  - Text classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing, which finds extensive applications in various domains, such as spam detection and sentiment analysis. Syntactic information can be effectively utilized to improve the performance of neural network models in understanding the semantics of text. The Chinese text exhibits a high degree of syntactic complexity, with individual words often possessing multiple parts of speech. In this paper, we propose BRsyn-caps, a capsule network-based Chinese text classification model that leverages both Bert and dependency syntax. Our proposed approach integrates semantic information through Bert pre-training model for obtaining word representations, extracts contextual information through Long Short-term memory neural network (LSTM), encodes syntactic dependency trees through graph attention neural network, and utilizes capsule network to effectively integrate features for text classification. Additionally, we propose a character-level syntactic dependency tree adjacency matrix construction algorithm, which can introduce syntactic information into character-level representation. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that BRsyn-caps can effectively integrate semantic, sequential, and syntactic information in text, proving the effectiveness of our proposed method for Chinese text classification.

AB  - Purpose Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescriptions have always relied on the experience of TCM doctors, and machine learning(ML) provides a technical means for learning these experiences and intelligently assists in prescribing. However, in TCM prescription, there are the main (Jun) herb and the auxiliary (Chen, Zuo and Shi) herb collocations. In a prescription, the types of auxiliary herbs are often more than the main herb and the auxiliary herbs often appear in other prescriptions. This leads to different frequencies of different herbs in prescriptions, namely, imbalanced labels (herbs). As a result, the existing ML algorithms are biased, and it is difficult to predict the main herb with less frequency in the actual prediction and poor performance. In order to solve the impact of this problem, this paper proposes a framework for multi-label traditional Chinese medicine (ML-TCM) based on multi-label resampling. Design/methodology/approach In this work, a multi-label learning framework is proposed that adopts and compares the multi-label random resampling (MLROS), multi-label synthesized resampling (MLSMOTE) and multi-label synthesized resampling based on local label imbalance (MLSOL), three multi-label oversampling techniques to rebalance the TCM data. Findings The experimental results show that after resampling, the less frequent but important herbs can be predicted more accurately. The MLSOL method is shown to be the best with over 10% improvements on average because it balances the data by considering both features and labels when resampling. Originality/value The authors first systematically analyzed the label imbalance problem of different sampling methods in the field of TCM and provide a solution. And through the experimental results analysis, the authors proved the feasibility of this method, which can improve the performance by 10%−30% compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Metrics have emerged as an important tool for quantitatively evaluating researchers from a variety of perspectives, including research impact, research quality, interdisciplinarity, and cross-disciplinarity. Especially in the field of library and information science, many previous studies have highlighted the characteristics of researchers in this field.However, only a minority of the studies address the aspect of diversity in research topics.The purpose of this study is to (1) evaluate the topic diversity of researchers in library and information science and (2) examine the relationships between the researcher topic diversity and research impact.We propose an indicator to quantify author topic diversity, which we refer to as author topic diversity (ATD).Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used to detect topics in the field, while cosine similarity is used to calculate the diversity of research topics in a given researcher's publications.The results show that topic diversity in the field of library and information science varies greatly from author to author.In addition, weak positive correlations are found between the ATD and citation indicators, suggesting that engaging in diversified topics may lead to higher research impact.

AB  - MLCommons is an effort to develop and improve the artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem through benchmarks, public data sets, and research. It consists of members from start-ups, leading companies, academics, and non-profits from around the world. The goal is to make machine learning better for everyone. In order to increase participation by others, educational institutions provide valuable opportunities for engagement. In this article, we identify numerous insights obtained from different viewpoints as part of efforts to utilize high-performance computing (HPC) big data systems in existing education while developing and conducting science benchmarks for earthquake prediction. As this activity was conducted across multiple educational efforts, we project if and how it is possible to make such efforts available on a wider scale. This includes the integration of sophisticated benchmarks into courses and research activities at universities, exposing the students and researchers to topics that are otherwise typically not sufficiently covered in current course curricula as we witnessed from our practical experience across multiple organizations. As such, we have outlined the many lessons we learned throughout these efforts, culminating in the need for benchmark carpentry for scientists using advanced computational resources. The article also presents the analysis of an earthquake prediction code benchmark while focusing on the accuracy of the results and not only on the runtime; notedly, this benchmark was created as a result of our lessons learned. Energy traces were produced throughout these benchmarks, which are vital to analyzing the power expenditure within HPC environments. Additionally, one of the insights is that in the short time of the project with limited student availability, the activity was only possible by utilizing a benchmark runtime pipeline while developing and using software to generate jobs from the permutation of hyperparameters automatically. It integrates a templated job management framework for executing tasks and experiments based on hyperparameters while leveraging hybrid compute resources available at different institutions. The software is part of a collection called cloudmesh with its newly developed components, cloudmesh-ee (experiment executor) and cloudmesh-cc (compute coordinator).

AB  - The researcher network that appeared in research projects funded by the Japanese government was analyzed. Several static and dynamic network analysis methods were applied to the data for 20 years to explore the fine structure of the researcher’s network for grants. Our analysis shows that the long-term trend of researchers’ group sizes has become smaller, particularly rapidly decreasing in recent years. Some findings on researcher behavior in joining a project have also been reported.

AB  - Healthcare investigators and clinicians need biomedical document classification to organize and handle the large volume of biomedical literature. Conventional classification methods use manually designed features, which may be timeconsuming and may not represent biomedical text complexity. Biomedical data’s high dimensionality and sparsity may also challenge current approaches. For big datasets, CNNs are computationally costly. Increasing feature extraction efficiency reduces training and inference durations. The proposed method intends to improve the accuracy of document classification in the biomedical sector considerably. It functions in two stages: feature extraction and classification. The proposed method employs a hybrid approach to biomedical document classification, focusing on the intricate interactions between genes, diseases, and chemical treatments via the use of a CNN Multi-class Support Vector Machine (M-SVM) model. CNN is utilized to extract features, while M-SVM is employed as a classifier. This work discusses Improved CNNs, which may extract more discriminative and informative features from input data, resulting in a more accurate representation of underlying patterns and connections. Error-Correcting Output Coding (ECOC) based on M-SVM is used to manage noisy data by merging the outputs of many binary classifiers, enabling it to recover from faults in individual classifiers and thereby lowering the risk of overfitting. The study’s results show that the proposed model is successful, with an accuracy of 99.28% and an F1-score of 99.84% across biomedical document datasets.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this bibliometric study was to review the scientific outputs published between 2000 and 2022 on osteoblastoma, a benign aggressive bone tumor.&#x0D; Methods: Scientific research articles on osteoblastoma published between 2000 and 2022 were targeted and data were obtained from the Web of Science database. The data obtained were analyzed and visualized using bibliometric programs.&#x0D; Results: A total of 679 articles about osteoblastoma published between 2000-2022 met our inclusion criteria. Most of the articles on osteoblastoma (n=48) were published in 2020. There was no noteworthy peak in the trend of the number of publications between 2000 and 2022. These articles cited 10366 times in total and 15.27 times per article. At least 62 various countries and regions took part in osteoblastoma publishing research over the past 22 years. The United States (192) was the largest contributor to osteoblastoma publications followed by China (60), India (51), Italy (50), and Turkey (46). The United States was the country that published the most publications in all years between 2000 and 2022. Especially China's publications increased in 2022. The United States was also the country with the highest level of publication collaboration (such as citation and co-authorship) among countries.&#x0D; Conclusion: The number of published articles is well below the expected level. Although the number of scientific publications from China has increased in recent years, the United States still ranks first.

AB  - The classifier chains algorithm is aimed at solving the multilabel classification problem by composing the labels into a randomized label order. The classification effect of this algorithm depends heavily on whether the label order is optimal. To obtain a better label ordering, the authors propose a multilabel classifier chains algorithm based on a maximum spanning tree and a directed acyclic graph. The algorithm first uses Pearson's correlation coefficient to calculate the correlation between labels and constructs the maximum spanning tree of labels, then calculates the mutual decision difficulty between labels to transform the maximum spanning tree into a directed acyclic graph, and it uses topological ranking to output the optimized label ordering. Finally, the authors use the classifier chains algorithm to train and predict against this label ordering. Experimental comparisons were conducted between the proposed algorithm and other related algorithms on seven datasets, and the proposed algorithm ranked first and second in six evaluation metrics, accounting for 76.2% and 16.7%, respectively. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and affirmed its contribution in exploring and utilizing label-related information.

AB  - Big data systems are being increasingly adopted by the enterprises exploiting big data applications to manage data-driven process, practices, and systems in an enterprise wide context. Specifically, big data systems and their underlying applications empower enterprises with analytical decision making (e.g., recommender/decision support systems) to optimize organizational productivity, competitiveness, and growth. Despite these benefits, big data applications face some challenges that include but not limited to security and privacy, authenticity, and reliability of critical data that may result in propagation of false information across systems. Data provenance as an approach and enabling mechanism (to identify the origin, manage the creation, and track the propagation of information etc.) can be a solution to above mentioned challenges for data management in an enterprise context. Data provenance solution(s) can help stakeholders and enterprises to assess the quality of data along with authenticity, reliability, and trust of information on the basis of identity, reproducibility and integrity of data. Considering the wide spread adoption of big data applications and the needs for data provenance, this paper focuses on (i) analyzing state-of-the-art for holistic presentation of provenance in big-data applications (ii) proposing a bio-inspired approach with underlying algorithm that exploits human thinking approach to support data provenance in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The proposed ‘Think-and-Share Optimization’ (TaSO) algorithms modularizes and automates data provenance in WSNs that are deployed and operated in enterprises. Evaluation of TaSO algorithm demonstrates its efficiency in terms of connectivity, closeness to the sink node, coverage, and execution time. The proposed research contextualizes bio-inspired computation to enable and optimize data provenance in WSNs. Future research aims to exploit machine learning techniques (with underlying algorithms) to automate data provenance for big data systems in networked environments.

AB  - Abstract Motivation The rapid expansion of Bioinformatics research has led to a proliferation of computational tools for scientific analysis pipelines. However, constructing these pipelines is a demanding task, requiring extensive domain knowledge and careful consideration. As the Bioinformatics landscape evolves, researchers, both novice and expert, may feel overwhelmed in unfamiliar fields, potentially leading to the selection of unsuitable tools during workflow development. Results In this paper, we introduce the Bioinformatics Tool Recommendation system (BTR), a deep learning model designed to recommend suitable tools for a given workflow-in-progress. BTR leverages recent advances in graph neural network technology, representing the workflow as a graph to capture essential context. Natural language processing techniques enhance tool recommendations by analyzing associated tool descriptions. Experiments demonstrate that BTR outperforms the existing Galaxy tool recommendation system, showcasing its potential to streamline scientific workflow construction.

AB  - Multimodal information retrieval, the task of re trieving relevant information from heterogeneous data sources such as text, images, and videos, has gained significant attention in recent years due to the proliferation of multimedia content on the internet. This paper proposes an approach to enhance multimodal information retrieval by integrating data mining and deep learning techniques. Traditional information retrieval systems often struggle to effectively handle multimodal data due to the inherent complexity and diversity of such data sources. In this study, we leverage data mining techniques to preprocess and structure multimodal data efficiently. Data mining methods enable us to extract valuable patterns, relationships, and features from different modalities, providing a solid foundation for sub- sequent retrieval tasks. To further enhance the performance of multimodal information retrieval, deep learning techniques are employed. Deep neural networks have demonstrated their effectiveness in various multimedia tasks, including image recognition, natural language processing, and video analysis. By integrating deep learning models into our retrieval framework, we aim to capture complex intermodal dependencies and semantically rich representations, enabling more accurate and context-aware retrieval.

AB  - The pre-trained model in the Chinese text classification task has made significant progress.However, there is a lot of semantically ambiguous and confusing text in the Chinese text, which has a negative impact on the classification model.A triplet network approach for Chinese confusing text classification is proposed to address this problem.This method improves the traditional triplet network's way of randomly constructing sample combinations, compares the feature similarity between the screened confusing text, straightforward text, and ordinary text, and improves the clustering effect of Chinese text features.At the same time, embedding text and label are jointly learned in the same latent space to learn the similarities and differences between texts of the same category and texts of confused categories.Experiments on multiple Chinese text classification datasets demonstrate the negative impact of confusing text on model accuracy and verify the method's effectiveness in this paper.

AB  - With the developments of internet technologies, dealing with a mass of law cases urgently and assigning classification cases automatically are the most basic and critical steps.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has been shown to be effective for text classification.To better apply CNNs into law text classification, this paper presents a new semi-supervised Convolutional Neural Networks (SSC) framework.Our method combines unlabeled data with a small labelled training set to train better models, and then integrates into a supervised CNN.More specifically, for effective use of word order for text categorization, we use the feature of not low-dimensional word vectors but high-dimensional text data, that is, a small text region is learned based on sequences of one-hot vectors.To better improve the prediction accuracy of the scheme, we seek effective use of unlabeled data for text categorization for integration into a supervised CNN.We compare the proposed scheme to state-of-the-art methods by the real datasets.The results demonstrate that the semi-supervised learning model can get best text classification accuracy.

AB  - Social-ecological systems (SES) research has gained substantial momentum, as witnessed by the growth in SES publications, theories, and frameworks, and the traction these concepts have gained in development and policy arenas. However, the growth and development of the SES field has only been partially examined, which limits our ability to make sense of and support the future development of the field and its ability to inform pressing sustainability challenges. The aim of this study is to understand how SES research has grown and changed over time as a field of study using bibliometric methods, co-authorship and co-citation network analysis. Our study is informed by broader bodies of work that have sought to understand the development of scientific fields, concepts, and research agendas. We highlight key trends that have influenced the organization of the field as well as how key thematic areas of SES research have evolved over time. Our results indicate that the research on SES is (i) mainly carried out by authors located in North America and Europe, (ii) characterized by changes in the terminology employed, as identified through our search terms, (iii) linked to the emergence of major conferences and centers dedicated to SES research, as well as its growth over time, (iv) characterized by a highly interconnected structure, with almost 80% of scholars being connected to each other, and (v) characterized by a shift in citation patterns, with newcomers in the network carving out their niche and replacing the founding figures as the central focus. We discuss the implications of these findings, including the nature of SES research as an "epistemic network," the highly collaborative nature of SES research, and the role played by open-access journals in the growth of SES research in the digital era. We further suggest that the SES research field is at a critical transition point, with contending visions of its future following a more disciplinary path or remaining as a more open interdisciplinary space. We conclude with the questions this raises for future SES research regarding the implications of this duality on the nature, production, and validation of knowledge and its evolution.

AB  - Modern investigations in biology often require the efforts of one or more groups of researchers. Often these are groups of specialists from various scientific fields who generate and share data of different formats and sizes. Without modern approaches to work automation and data versioning (where data from different collaborators are stored at different points in time), teamwork quickly devolves into unmanageable confusion. In this review, we present a number of information systems designed to solve these problems. Their application to the organization of scientific activity helps to manage the flow of actions and data, allowing all participants to work with relevant information and solving the issue of reproducibility of both experimental and computational results. The article describes methods for organizing data flows within a team, principles for organizing metadata and ontologies. The information systems Trello, Git, Redmine, SEEK, OpenBIS and Galaxy are considered. Their functionality and scope of use are described. Before using any tools, it is important to understand the purpose of implementation, to define the set of tasks they should solve, and, based on this, to formulate requirements and finally to monitor the application of recommendations in the field. The tasks of creating a framework of ontologies, metadata, data warehousing schemas and software systems are key for a team that has decided to undertake work to automate data circulation. It is not always possible to implement such systems in their entirety, but one should still strive to do so through a step­by­step introduction of principles for organizing data and tasks with the mastery of individual software tools. It is worth noting that Trello, Git, and Redmine are easier to use, customize, and support for small research groups. At the same time, SEEK, OpenBIS, and Galaxy are more specific and their use is advisable if the capabilities of simple systems are no longer sufficient.

AB  - This study aims to determine the interest of final year students who are completing their final project to make publications in reputable journals. At present, 9 criteria accreditation requires a lot of publications from students while the climate of publication of student work is still not well formed. Therefore, activities and policies are needed to build a culture of publication. Research workshops are one way to encourage students to make publications. This study uses final year students who are finishing their final assignments as respondents/ workshop participants. The goal is that the results of their final project can be published directly in a reputable journal. The results showed that after attending the workshop, the majority of respondents gave positive responses related to the workshop activities and had a high enough interest to do the publication. The results of this study have practical implications for policy makers to regularly conduct research workshops for students.

AB  - The capabilities of deep models are constantly mined for extraction and representation of features among text classification tasks. However, these models are sensitive to changes in input data, resulting in poor robustness. Meanwhile, the model lacks information interaction and weak representation ability. In this work, for feature extraction, a joint model that consists of a convolutional neural network, a bidirectional gated recurrent unit, and an attention mechanism is proposed. This new model can improve versatility and fully discover category information in text. For feature representation, a projector under the supervised contrastive learning method is introduced. The method can improve the representation of an encoder and realize aggregation of the same category. Considering the robustness of the PCRA, the gradient penalty is added to a contrastive loss function. Experiments are performed on four datasets to assess the proposed model (PCRA and PCRA-GP) using an accuracy metric. The experimental results show that our model is suitable for variable-length and bilingual texts. Compared with the baseline model, it remains competitive, and it reaches SOTA on the 20 Newsgroups dataset. Moreover, the performance of the model is evaluated under different hyperparameters to clarify its working mechanism.

AB  - With the rapid accumulation of large amounts of user-generated content through social media, social data reuse and integration have gained increasing attention recently. This has made it almost obsolete for software applications to collect, store, and work with their own data stored on local servers. While, with the provision of Application Programming Interfaces from the leading social networking sites, data acquisition and integration has become possible, the meaningful usage of such unstructured, non-uniform, and incoherent data collections needs special procedures of data summarization, understanding, and visualization. One particular aspect in this regard that needs special attention is the procedures for data (text snippets in the form of social media posts) categorization and concept tagging to filter out the relevant and most suitable data for the particular audience and for the particular purpose. In this regard, we propose a corpus-based approach for searching and successively categorizing and tagging the social data with relevant concepts in real time. The proposed approach is capable of addressing the semantical and morphological similarities, as well as domain-specific vocabularies of query strings and tagged concepts. We demonstrate the feasibility and application of our proposed approach in a web-based tool that allows searching Facebook posts and provides search results together with a concept map for further navigation, filtering, and refining of search results. The tool has been evaluated by performing multiple search queries, and resultant concept maps and annotated texts are analyzed in terms of their precision. The approach is thereby found effective in achieving its stated goal of classifying text snippets in real time.

AB  - Semi-supervised learning is one of the potential research fields in text classification. In this paper, semi-supervised pseudo-label training experiments are conducted using the BERT model that has been pre-trained as a baseline. Only 20% of the original dataset is used for the new training set after segmenting the training set. The raw corpus used for pseudo-label training consists of the remaining 80% of data after labels are removed, while the original test set is still utilized. The results indicate that the key to the semi-supervised pseudo-labelling method is the performance of the original model and reasonable data filtering techniques. Even though the SoftMax value used for data filtering is not precisely equivalent to model prediction accuracy, experimental results show it can somewhat reduce the error propagation problem of the model. This is consistent with earlier research. However, using SoftMax as the threshold for data screening can't bring enough benefits to the model training and make it surpass the training performance of the original data set. As a result, future studies will focus on improving the accuracy of pseudo-labelling with a more suitable data selection method to better the model's performance.

AB  - High-performance data analytics (HPDA) is a current trend in e-science research that aims to integrate traditional HPC with recent data analytic frameworks. Most of the work done in this field has focused on improving data analytic frameworks by implementing their engines on top of HPC technologies such as Message Passing Interface. However, there is a lack of integration from an application development perspective. HPC workflows have their own parallel programming models, while data analytic (DA) algorithms are mainly implemented using data transformations and executed with frameworks like Spark. Task-based programming models (TBPMs) are a very efficient approach for implementing HPC workflows. Data analytic transformations can also be decomposed as a set of tasks and implemented with a task-based programming model. In this paper, we present a methodology to develop HPDA applications on top of TBPMs that allow developers to combine HPC workflows and data analytic transformations seamlessly. A prototype of this approach has been implemented on top of the PyCOMPSs task-based programming model to validate two aspects: HPDA applications can be seamlessly developed and have better performance than Spark. We compare our results using different programs. Finally, we conclude with the idea of integrating DA into HPC applications and evaluation of our method against Spark.

Querying the Web of Science database and applying filters revealed a sample of 273 articles. The distribution by years, by countries, by authors, by categories, by fields of research, by sustainable development goals of this sample was followed. Also, within the work, a qualitative analysis was carried out, following the words and phrases with the highest density in the studied articles. The investigation method was based on the PRISMA Statements methodology. To determine the correlations regarding the countries of origin of the authors, the Co-authorship filter was used with a minimum number of 10 documents/country and a minimum number of 11 citations/country, so out of 73 countries only 14 met the conditions for analysis. For the word density analysis, the co-occurrence filter was applied, with a minimum occurrence of 5, resulting in 37 words grouped into 5 clusters. To support the conclusions, the following classifications were analyzed: WOS Categories, Research Areas, Sustainable Development Goals, Citation Topics Micro. The results of the research constitute the starting point for future analyzes in the field of investments."

AB  - How do new ideas emerge in academic contexts and what forces determine which ideas get selected and which are forgotten? We analyze all papers presented at the ANPEC Brazilian Economics National Meetings from 2013 to 2019 using topic modeling and Kullback-Leibler divergence to measure novelty and resonance. In contrast to simply counting citations or reference combinations, these methods explore the Shannon information in the actual texts to detect the rise of new patterns and whether these patterns persist once they have been established. We find that novelty is highly correlated with transience so that most new ideas are quickly forgotten. However, of the ideas that persist, those that are more novel have higher impact. We show that our text-based measure of impact is correlated with subsequent citations.

AB  - Citation count is extensively used within research systems to measure research performance and relevance. However, high numbers of citations could result from many different factors. This paper proposes an adjusted citation count metric to help identify citations from researchers’ networks. Using data from the Web of Science core collection, this research suggests and illustrates an approach to compute the proportion of citation counts from within and out of author networks, defined as the set of their co-authors. The results reveal the trends and effects of author networks on citation counts. The paper explains how these findings could be used to assess research performance. Its utilisation will depend mainly on the objectives of the assessor and the stage of the researcher’s career. An algorithm is also proposed that could be used to automate the computation of the proposed metric. It could serve as a step towards refining and integrating this metric into existing bibliometric analysis packages built on the R software platform.

AB  - Nowadays, there are many types of digital materials that can be used in the classroom. Students and scholars are migrating from textbooks to digital study materials because textbooks are too large and expensive. Teachers and college students can use and modify the materials that are freely available or with some constraints for their learning and teaching. E-content can be designed, evolved, utilized, re-used, and distributed electronically from anywhere at anytime. Because of the flexibility of time, place, and speed of learning, e-content is becoming extremely popular. It can be readily and instantly shared and communicated with an infinite number of clients all across the globe. Document clustering is most commonly used to group documents that are related to a specific topic. Text document clustering can be used to group a collection of documents regarding the information they include and to deliver search results when a user searches the internet. In this paper mainly focuses on text document clustering to cope with massive collection of E-Content documents. Enhanced Expectation Maximization Text Document Clustering (EEMTDC) clustering algorithm was proposed and compared with Expectation Maximization (EM) clustering, K-Means clustering, and Hierarchical clustering (HC) algorithms. The experiment shows that the performance of proposed EEMTDC algorithm produces greater clustering accuracy than existing clustering algorithms.

AB  - Domain experts are increasingly employing machine learning to solve their domain-specific problems. This article presents to software engineering researchers the six key challenges that a domain expert faces in addressing their problem with a computational workflow, and the underlying executable implementation. These challenges arise out of our conceptual framework which presents the “route” of transformations that a domain expert may choose to take while developing their solution. To ground our conceptual framework in the state of the practice, this article discusses a selection of available textual and graphical workflow systems and their support for the transformations described in our framework. Example studies from the literature in various domains are also examined to highlight the tools used by the domain experts as well as a classification of the domain specificity and machine learning usage of their problem, workflow, and implementation. The state of the practice informs our discussion of the six key challenges, where we identify which challenges and transformations are not sufficiently addressed by available tools. We also suggest possible research directions for software engineering researchers to increase the automation of these tools and disseminate best-practice techniques between software engineering and various scientific domains.

AB  - Recent research in NLP has exploited word embedding to achieve outstanding results in various tasks such as; spam filtering, text classification and summarization and others.Present word embedding algorithms have power to capture semantic and syntactic knowledge about word, but not enough to portray the distinct meaning of polysemy word.Many work has utilized sense embeddings to integrate all possible meaning to word vector, which is computationally expensive.Context embedding is another way out to identify word's actual meaning, but it is hard to enumerate every context with a small size dataset.This paper has proposed a methodology to generate improved class-specific word vector that enhance the distinctive property of word in a class to tackle light polysemy problem in question classification.The proposed approach is compared with baseline approaches, tested using deep learning models upon TREC, Kaggle and Yahoo questions datasets and respectively attain 93.6%, 91.8% and 89.2% accuracy.

AB  - Abstract For populating Scientific Knowledge Graphs (SciKGs), research publications pose a central information source. However, typical forms of research publications like traditional papers do not provide means of integrating contributions into SciKGs. Furthermore, they do not support making direct use of the rich information SciKGs provide. To tackle this, the present paper proposes RDFtex , a framework enabling (1) the import of contributions represented in SciKGs to facilitate the preparation of "Equation missing"<!-- image only, no MathML or LaTex -->-based research publications and (2) the export of original contributions from papers to facilitate their integration into SciKGs. The framework’s functionality is demonstrated using the present paper itself since it was prepared with our proof-of-concept implementation of RDFtex. The runtime of the implementation’s preprocessor was evaluated based on three "Equation missing"<!-- image only, no MathML or LaTex --> projects with different numbers of imports and exports. A small user study ( $$N=10$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mi>N</mml:mi> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mn>10</mml:mn> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> ) was conducted to obtain initial user feedback. The concept and the process of preparing a "Equation missing"<!-- image only, no MathML or LaTex -->-based research publication using RDFtex are discussed thoroughly. RDFtex’s import functionality takes considerably more time than its export functionality. Nevertheless, the entire preprocessing takes only a fraction of the time required to compile the PDF. The users were able to solve all predefined tasks but preferred the import functionality over the export functionality because of its general simplicity. RDFtex is a promising approach to facilitate the move toward knowledge graph augmented research since it only introduces minor differences compared to the preparation of traditional "Equation missing"<!-- image only, no MathML or LaTex -->-based publications while narrowing the gap between papers and SciKGs.

AB  - Following the progress made in the construction of high-speed processors, the limiting effect of the way data is entered into the computer on the speed of information transfer has become more apparent. By using processing devices, in addition to achieving higher speed in the data retrieval stage, it is also possible to use their pre-processing capabilities and change the data format. Considering the importance of the topic and the work that has been done in this field, the need to discover the knowledge of the existing features with the help of choosing the appropriate feature for the classification of texts is well felt. In this article, genetic algorithm and fuzzy logic have been used to present a method for classifying texts in insurance booklets. This system is based on several stages. These steps include the learning phase that examines a set of educational texts to extract the characteristics of the categories to be the characteristics of each category; the test phase of the system is used to classify uncategorized texts. The proposed method's accuracy has been assessed using a collection of patient notebooks, and the outcomes indicate an accuracy of around 98% for the classification.

AB  - The recent increase in the emergence of Nigerian language text online motivates this paper in which the problem of classifying text documents written in Yorùbá language into one of a few pre-designated classes is considered. Text document classification/categorization research is well established for English language and many other languages; this is not so for Nigerian languages. This paper evaluated the performance of a multinomial Naive Bayes model learned on a research dataset consisting of 100 samples of text each from business, sporting, entertainment, technology and political domains, separately on unigram, bigram and trigram features obtained using the bag of words representation approach. Results show that the performance of the model over unigram and bigram features is comparable but significantly better than a model learned on trigram features. The results generally indicate a possibility for the practical application of NB algorithm to the classification of text documents written in Yorùbá language.&#x0D; Keywords: Supervised learning, text classification, Yorùbá language, text mining, BoW Representation

AB  - Abstract Editors are journals’ entrepreneurs, managers, and stewards. They have the duty of holding high standards of scholarly quality in terms of end product (articles) and due process (adequate peer-review procedures). Given the importance of journals in the contemporary science “ecosystem,” editors emerge as decisive power brokers. Elite board members are scrutinizers but, paradoxically, they are themselves seldom subject to systematic study. This paper presents a comprehensive portrait of the editorship phenomenon in Innovation Studies by probing the structural features of the boards of 20 leading innovation-oriented journals as of 2019 and conducting an editor survey. We account for 2,440 individual editors in 3,005 different roles based in 53 countries. We uncover the overwhelming dominance of U.S.-affiliated editors and the contrasting rare presence of scholars from the Global South. The gender balance tilts toward men, with a weight above 60%. Enhanced journal achievement is associated with editors on multiple boards, diverse national representation, and increased women on boards. Almost 20% of scholars serve on multiple boards, and no single journal is free from this interlocking editorship phenomenon. The journal Research Policy is the most central in the cross-board network, followed by Industrial and Corporate Change. Finally, the implications of editormetrics for journal governance are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Purpose Interdisciplinary fields have become the driving force of modern science and a significant source of scientific innovation. However, there is still a paucity of analysis about the essential characteristics of disciplines’ cross-disciplinary impact. Design/methodology/approach In this study, we define cross-disciplinary impact on one discipline as its impact to other disciplines, and refer to a three-dimensional framework of variety-balance-disparity to characterize the structure of cross-disciplinary impact. The variety of cross-disciplinary impact of the discipline was defined as the proportion of the high cross-disciplinary impact publications, and the balance and disparity of cross-disciplinary impact were measured as well. To demonstrate the cross-disciplinary impact of the disciplines in science, we chose Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) as the data source, and investigated the relationship between disciplines’ cross-disciplinary impact and their positions in the Hierarchy of Science (HOS). Findings Analytical results show that there is a significant correlation between the ranking of cross-disciplinary impact and the HOS structure, and that the discipline exerts a greater cross-disciplinary impact on its neighboring disciplines. Several bibliometric features that measure the hardness of a discipline, including the number of references, the number of cited disciplines, the citation distribution, and the Price index have a significant positive effect on the variety of cross-disciplinary impact. The number of references, the number of cited disciplines, and the citation distribution have significant positive and negative effects on balance and disparity, respectively. It is concluded that the less hard the discipline, the greater the cross-disciplinary impact, the higher balance and the lower disparity of cross-disciplinary impact. Research limitations In the empirical analysis of HOS, we only included five broad disciplines. This study also has some biases caused by the data source and applied regression models. Practical implications This study contributes to the formulation of discipline-specific policies and promotes the growth of interdisciplinary research, as well as offering fresh insights for predicting the cross-disciplinary impact of disciplines. Originality/value This study provides a new perspective to properly understand the mechanisms of cross-disciplinary impact and disciplinary integration.

AB  - The citation of big scientific data is crucial not only for scientific activity but also for the scientific discovery and dissemination within scientist network. The main objective of this research is to develop a service-oriented data citation system using data mining techniques for Middle East and North Africa scientists. A novel service oriented framework is proposed to prototype the development of the system that includes query for-malization, service discovery, service composition design, service selection, search space, and service optimization. In this research, Wikipedia scientific-related articles are connected with more than 35 petabyte Pangaea datasets. The output of this work is a web service that takes Wikipedia article information as an input and provides the possible relevant datasets (if exist) related to the article. The evaluation of this research is based on a quantitative assessment performed to the quality of web service metrics, such as number of access and bandwidth utilization; which shows that the framework is robust enough to handle both big data access and its citation.

AB  - The plots of many literary works are very complex, which hinders the readers' comprehension of these literary works. Thus, to help readers' comprehension of complex literary works, tools should be proposed to support their comprehension by presenting the most important information to readers. In the case of literary works, the most important information may be the most important people, also called the key people. Key people play an important role in promoting the development of the plot of literary works. Thus, identifying key people helps to simplify readers' comprehension of literary works. The traditional way to comprehend literary works mainly depends on intensive reading, and no previous work has been done to explore the problem of key people identification in literary works. In this paper, we define the concept of key people and propose an approach, IPWC, to Identify key People in Chinese literary Works using e -Core decomposition. First, it uses the Weighted People co-occurrence Network (WPN) to represent people and their coupling relationships, and the frequency of the relationship. Second, an e -core decomposition is proposed and applied to decompose the WPN into shells and obtain the coreness of each people. Finally, all the people are sorted in a descending order according to their coreness, and the top-ranked people are the key people identified by our approach. The empirical experiments performed on a famous Chinese literary work, The History of the Three Kingdoms, show that WPN has small world and scale-free features. Furthermore, our approach is feasible and more effective than other compared approaches. Our approach can be used to build an automatic tool that can identify the key people for readers to aid their comprehension of a Chinese literary work.

AB  - In this paper, a new method for automatically analyzing and classifying books and book collections according to the subjects they cover is presented. It is based on a combination of the LDA method for discovering latent topics in the collection, on the one hand, and the description of subjects by means of a <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">subject term vocabulary</i> , on the other. Books, topics and subjects, all are modelled as <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">bag-of-words</i> , with specific distributions over the underlying word vocabulary. The <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Table of Contents (ToC)</i> was used to describe the books, instead of their entire body, while <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">subject</i> (or <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">standard</i> ) <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">documents</i> are produced by a subject term hierarchy of the respective disciplines. Frequency-of-terms in the documents and word-generative probabilistic models (as the ones postulated by LDA) were integrated into a consistent statistical framework. Using Bayesian statistics and simple marginalization equations we were able to transform the expressions of the books from <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">distributions over unlabeled topics</i> (derived by the LDA) to <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">distributions over labeled subjects</i> representing the respective disciplines (Physical sciences, Health sciences, Mathematics, etc). More specifically, the necessary theoretical basis is firstly established, with each <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">subject</i> formally defined by the respective <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">branch of a subject term hierarchy</i> (much like a ToC) or the respective <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">bag of words</i> (single words and biwords) produced by flattening the hierarchy branch; flattening is realized by taking all the terms of the nodes and leaves of the branch with repetitions allowed. Being confined within a closed set of subjects, we are able to invert the <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">frequency-of-terms</i> in each subject [also interpreted as the probability of generating a term ( <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">w<sub>n</sub></i> ) when sampling the subject ( <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">s<sub>i</sub></i> ) and denoted by Pr{ <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">w<sub>n</sub></i> | <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">s<sub>i</sub></i> })] and express each term as a <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">weighted mixture</i> (or <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">probability distribution</i> ) <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">of subjects</i> , denoted by Pr{ <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">s<sub>i</sub></i> | <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">w<sub>n</sub></i> }. This is the key idea of the proposed method. Then, any document (d <sub xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><i>m</i></sub> ) can be expressed as a weighted mixture of subjects (or the respective distribution, denoted by Pr{ <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">s<sub>i</sub></i> |d <sub xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><i>m</i></sub> }) by simply summing up the distributions of the individual terms contained in the document. This is made possible by virtue of some simple formulas that have been formally proven for the union of documents (Pr{ <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">s<sub>i</sub></i> |(d <sub xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">1</sub> ∪d <sub xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">2</sub> )}) and for the union of subjects (Pr{( <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">s<sub>i</sub></i> ∪ <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">s<sub>j</sub></i> )|d}). Since not all vocabulary terms are found in a particular set of books, nor, conversely, all corpus words are included in the subject vocabulary either, two important measures come to the foreground and are calculated with the proposed formulation: the <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">coverage of a book or a corpus by the subject term vocabulary</i> and, conversely, the <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">vocabulary coverage by a set of books</i> . These measures are useful for updating/enriching the subject term vocabulary, whenever it happens that documents with new subjects are included in the corpus under analysis. Following the theoretical formulation, the derived results are combined with the LDA in order to further facilitate our multisubject analysis task: using the subject term vocabulary, LDA is applied on the corpus under study and results in expressing each book (b <sub xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><i>m</i></sub> ), as a probability distribution over hidden topics (denoted by Pr{t <sub xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><i>k</i></sub> |b <sub xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><i>m</i></sub> }). In the same framework, each topic (t <sub xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><i>k</i></sub> ) is expressed as a probability distribution over words (Pr{ <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">w<sub>n</sub></i> |t <sub xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><i>k</i></sub> }). Having estimated each word’s probability distribution over subjects (Pr{ <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">s<sub>i</sub></i> | <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">w<sub>n</sub></i> }), we can express each discovered topic as a weighted mixture of subjects [Pr{ <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">s<sub>i</sub></i> |t <sub xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><i>k</i></sub> } = Σ <sub xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><i>n</i></sub> Pr{ <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">w<sub>n</sub></i> |t <sub xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><i>k</i></sub> } Pr{ <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">s<sub>i</sub></i> | <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">w<sub>n</sub></i> }] and, by using that, we express each book in the same manner [Pr{ <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">s<sub>i</sub></i> |b <sub xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><i>m</i></sub> } = Σ <sub xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">k</sub> Pr{t <sub xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><i>k</i></sub> |b <sub xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><i>m</i></sub> } Pr{ <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">s<sub>i</sub></i> |t <sub xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><i>k</i></sub> }]. This is a very clear and formal way towards obtaining the desired result. The proposed methodology was applied to a Springer’s e-book collection with more than 50,000 books, while a subject term hierarchy developed by KALLIPOS, a project creating open-access e-books, was used for the proof of concept. A number of experiments were conducted to showcase the validity and usefulness of the proposed approach.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly developing field of research that attracts significant funding from both the state and industry players. Such interest is driven by a wide range of AI technology applications in many fields. Since many AI research topics relate to computer science, where a significant share of research results are published in conference proceedings, the same applies to AI. The world leaders in artificial intelligence research are China and the United States. The authors conducted a comparative analysis of the bibliometric indicators of AI conference papers from these two countries based on Scopus data. The analysis aimed to identify conferences that receive above-average citation rates and suggest publication strategies for authors from these countries to participate in conferences that are likely to provide better dissemination of their research results. The results showed that, although Chinese researchers publish more AI papers than those from the United States, US conference papers are cited more frequently. The authors also conducted a correlation analysis of the MNCS index, which revealed no high correlation between MNCS USA vs. MNCS China, MNCS China/MNCS USA vs. MSAR, and MNCS China/MNCS USA vs. CORE ranking indicators.

AB  - The rapid development of technologies has led to an increasing number of research works submitted to journals or conferences. However, the process of submitting articles can be challenging for authors due to the wide range of subjects covered by submission systems, such as the Association for Computing Machinery, with 2,000 subjects. This challenge arises from the need to accurately categorize the manuscript into the appropriate subject area before submission. This article proposes an automatic solution that extracts information and categorizes scientific papers into relevant topics to address this issue. The proposed approach employs pre-processing, extraction, vectorization, and classification techniques using three machine learning methods: support vector machines, Naïve Bayes, and decision trees. The experiments conducted on a dataset of articles published in the Tra Vinh University Journal of Science show promising results. The support vector machines technique, in particular, achieved an accuracy rate of over 75%, demonstrating its potential as a tool for developing an automatic classification system for scientific papers.

AB  - Synthesis — the construction of a new conceptual whole that advances understanding — is critical for research progress. Its current practice is also extremely laborious and costly. In this paper, we explore what fresh ideas CSCW might have to offer for making effective synthesis less painful and more commonplace. In particular, we draw on CSCW ideas around distributed sensemaking and integrated crowdsourcing to explore the idea of distributed synthesis: systems for sharing and reusing intermediate synthesis materials such as annotations and notes to kickstart and accelerate the synthesis process. We report in-progress findings from our analysis of in-depth guided tours of scholarly synthesis work practices, to bridge the gap between distributed sensemaking and integrated crowdsourcing (which has not yet been studied in the setting of scholarly synthesis) and scholarly synthesis workflows (which have not yet been analyzed from a distributed lens).

AB  - The exploration of semantic similarity is a fundamental aspect of natural language processing, as it aids in comprehending the significance and usage of vocabulary present in a language. The advent of pre-training language models has significantly simplified the process of research in this field. This article delves into the methodology of utilizing the pre-trained language model, BERT, to calculate the semantic similarity among Chinese words. In order to conduct this study, we first trained our own model using the bert-base-chinese pre-trained model. This allowed us to acquire the word embeddings for every single word, which served as the basis for calculating semantic similarity. Essentially, word embeddings are vector-based depictions of words that encapsulate word’s significance and surroundings, allowing for the measurement of the semantic similarity between words. Next, we executed a sequence of experiments to assess the efficiency of the BERT model in managing semantic similarity tasks within the Chinese language. The results were encouraging, as the BERT model demonstrated remarkable performance in these tasks. Furthermore, it was observed that the BERT model outperformed traditional methods in terms of performance and generalization capabilities. This study, therefore, underscores the potential of the BERT model in natural language processing, particularly in the Chinese language. This emphasizes the model’s capacity to accurately calculate semantic similarity, paving the way for its widespread adoption in related fields.

AB  - Automatic hierarchical text classification has been a challenging and in-needed task with an increasing of hierarchical taxonomy from the booming of knowledge organization. The hierarchical structure identifies the relationships of dependence between different categories in which can be overlapped of generalized and specific concepts within the tree. This paper presents the use of frequency of the occurring term in related categories among the hierarchical tree to help in document classification. The four extended term weighting of Relative Inverse Document Frequency (IDFr) including its located category, its parent category, its sibling categories and its child categories are exploited to generate a classifier model using centroid-based technique. From the experiment on hierarchical text classification of Thai documents, the IDFr achieved the best accuracy and F-measure as 53.65% and 50.80% in Top-n features set from family-based evaluation in which are higher than TF-IDF for 2.35% and 1.15% in the same settings, respectively.

AB  - The field of statistical computing is rapidly developing and evolving. Shifting away from the formerly siloed landscape of mathematics, statistics, and computer science, recent advancements in statistical computing are largely characterized by a fusing of these worlds; namely, programming, software development, and applied statistics are merging in new and exciting ways. There are numerous drivers behind this advancement, including open movement (encompassing development, science, and access), the advent of data science as a field, and collaborative problem-solving, as well as practice-altering advances in subfields such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and Bayesian estimation. In this paper, we trace this shift in how modern statistical computing is performed, and that which has recently emerged from it. This discussion points to a future of boundless potential for the field.

AB  - The main purpose of IoT is to deliver reliable, high quality services and innovative solutions by transforming the captured data into meaningful information, and thus improving user's daily life. In this regard, it is in the interest of the community to encourage entities within IoT environments to share their data, and therefore serve public interest and contribute to the innovation and technological progress. Meanwhile, the distributed nature of IoT networks and the diversity of its actors lead to the recognition of security and data sharing management as one of the major challenges of the IoT domain. For instance, due to insufficient governance of the shared data within IoT environments, data provider retains little to no control over his assets once he has agreed to share them. Furthermore, data consumers are not able to trace the source of the available resource nor its history processing to assess its quality. All this creates a digital environment that is certainly functional but lacks mutual trust between its actors, which can prevent the domain's full potential to be exploited, and therefore disrupt the implemented services. In our work, we propose an approach to improve data sharing management using three main elements: semantic modeling, usage control policies, and data provenance.

AB  - Hierarchical multi-label classification problems typically deal with datasets with many attributes and labels, which can negatively impact the classifier performance. The application of dimensionality reduction methods can significantly improve the performance of classifiers. Dimensionality reduction can be performed by feature extraction or feature selection, according to the problem domain and datasets characteristics. This work carried out a systematic literature mapping to identify the approaches and techniques of dimensionality reduction that have been used in hierarchical multi-label classification tasks. Searches were performed on 7 important databases for the Computer Science field. From a list of 184 retrieved papers, 12 were selected for analysis, from which it was possible to determine a general overview of studies conducted from 2010 to 2022. It was identified that feature selection was the most frequent reduction method, with filter approach standing out. In addition, it was detected that most of the works used tree hierarchical structure. As its main outcome, this paper presents the state of the art of dimensionality reduction problem for hierarchical multi-label classification, indicating trends and research issues in the field.

AB  - Partial label learning (PLL) induces a multi-class classifier from training examples each associated with a set of candidate labels, among which only one is valid. The formation of real-world data typically arises from heterogeneous entanglement of series latent explanatory factors, which are considered intrinsic properties for discriminating between different patterns. Though learning disentangled representation is expected to facilitate label disambiguation for partial-label (PL) examples, few existing works were dedicated to addressing this issue. In this paper, we make the first attempt towards disentangled PLL and propose a novel approach named TERIAL, which makes predictions according to derived disentangled representation of instances and label embeddings. The TERIAL approach formulates the PL examples as an undirected bipartite graph where instances are only connected with their candidate labels, and employs a tailored neighborhood routing mechanism to yield disentangled representation of nodes in the graph. Specifically, the proposed routing mechanism progressively infers the explanatory factors that contribute to the edge between adjacent nodes and augments the representation of the central node with factor-aware embedding information propagated from specific neighbors simultaneously via iteratively analyzing the promising subspace clusters formed by the node and its neighbors. The estimated labeling confidence matrix is also introduced to accommodate unreliable links owing to the inherent ambiguity of PLL. Moreover, we theoretically prove that the neighborhood routing mechanism will converge to the point estimate that maximizes the marginal likelihood of observed PL training examples. Comprehensive experiments over various datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts.

AB  - The goal of semi-supervised text classification (SSTC) is to train a model by exploring both a small number of labeled data and a large number of unlabeled data, such that the learned semi-supervised classifier performs better than the supervised classifier trained on solely the labeled samples. Pseudo-labeling is one of the most widely used SSTC techniques, which trains a teacher classifier with a small number of labeled examples to predict pseudo labels for the unlabeled data. The generated pseudo-labeled examples are then utilized to train a student classifier, such that the learned student classifier can outperform the teacher classifier. Nevertheless, the predicted pseudo labels may be inaccurate, making the performance of the student classifier degraded. The student classifier may perform even worse than the teacher classifier. To alleviate this issue, in this paper, we introduce a dual meta-learning ( DML ) technique for semi-supervised text classification, which improves the teacher and student classifiers simultaneously in an iterative manner. Specifically, we propose a meta-noise correction method to improve the student classifier by proposing a Noise Transition Matrix (NTM) with meta-learning to rectify the noisy pseudo labels. In addition, we devise a meta pseudo supervision method to improve the teacher classifier. Concretely, we exploit the feedback performance from the student classifier to further guide the teacher classifier to produce more accurate pseudo labels for the unlabeled data. In this way, both teacher and student classifiers can co-evolve in the iterative training process. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets highlight the effectiveness of our DML method against existing state-of-the-art methods for semi-supervised text classification. We release our code and data of this paper publicly at https://github.com/GRIT621/DML.

AB  - Current AI&IoT edge devices run complex applications and are under the threat of stealthy attacks that are not easily detected by traditional security systems. Provenance auditing is a promising technique for determining the ramification of an attack from DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) of event logs. However, the original provenance auditing was designed for personal computers and is not suitable for edge devices. Therefore, introducing provenance auditing on edge devices raises the following three problems. (1) Current edge devices have relatively powerful CPUs, but they are not enough for provenance auditing. (2) Most provenance auditing tools are developed as normal applications, and the log data is exposed to an untrusted area. (3) Most edge devices are used outdoors without an administrator (e.g., smart city) and must be managed by secure M2M (Machine to Machine). To prove these problems, we propose TEE-PA to securely collect system call logs on an edge device using TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) and send them to a remote provenance auditing on a powerful server. The system call logs are directly transferred from the kernel to the TEE and are not exposed to administrators as well as attackers, making it more secure than traditional provenance auditing. Although the kernel runs in an untrusted REE (Rich Execution Environment) and has a semantic gap from the TEE, TEE-PA offers a semi-TCB (Trusted Computing Base) that measures the kernel integrity check mechanism from the TEE at boot time and partially trusts the kernel. Operational correctness is periodically confirmed by unpredictable heartbeat messages sent from the remote provenance auditing server. If the correctness is not confirmed in the logs on the server, heartbeat message is not sent, triggering an autonomous recovery with a system reset of the watchdog timer protected by the TEE. We implemented a prototype of TEE-PA on the Arm TrustZone of Raspberry Pi3 with SPADE and LKRG (Linux Kernel Runtime Guard) as remote provenance auditing and kernel integrity check. We demonstrate that TEE-PA can determine the ramifications of stealthy attacks (fileless malware and shell command attacks) with acceptable performance. The performance evaluation estimates that remote provenance auditing is 19 times faster than on-board provenance auditing.

AB  - Earth system science is an interdisciplinary effort to understand the fundamentals and interactions of environmental processes. Interdisciplinary research is challenging since it demands the integration of scientific schemes and practices from different research fields into a collaborative work environment. This paper introduces the framework F4ESS that supports this integration. F4ESS provides methods and technologies that facilitate the development of integrative work environments for Earth system science. F4ESS enables scientists a) to outline structured and summarized descriptions of scientific procedures to facilitate communication and synthesis, b) to combine a large variety of distributed data analysis software into seamless data analysis chains and workflows, c) to visually combine and interactively explore the manifold spatiotemporal data and results to support understanding and knowledge creation. The F4ESS methods and technologies are generic and can be applied in various scientific fields. We discuss F4ESS in the context of the interdisciplinary investigation of flood events.

AB  - Computational approaches to archives present archivists and users with new ways of engaging with records and their provenance. Such approaches are particularly useful for scientific archives due to the collective and collaborative nature of modern scientific knowledge production. This article explores computational approaches to digitized fonds of scientists involved in the transdisciplinary scientific movement cybernetics through the Cybernetics Thought Collective: A History of Science and Technology Portal Project as a means to reveal the ways cyberneticians have developed concepts and debated ideas through the creation and exchange of correspondence and other records. The project has experimented with machine-learning and natural-language-processing tools to generate data from the materials in an effort to reveal connections between the cyberneticians and their correspondence. Cybernetics seeks to understand the human condition through experiments with machines, and, in a cybernetically inspired sense, so too do archivists seek to understand their archives through experiments with machines. Such explorations are important for documenting scientific thought collectives like cybernetics in a digital age.

AB  - Evaluating the long-term influence of academic papers in the early stage after publication is crucial for research management and decision-making.Although the total number of citations has been considered as a valid indicator to measure the academic influence of papers, there are still some bottleneck problems in predicting future citation counts.Firstly, it remains a challenging task to select the reasonable features due to the diversity of model features.Secondly, some prediction models are overly complex and their defects may cause prediction bias or even errors.Finally, the most important thing is that very few models possess long-term predictive ability.This paper proposes a prediction model that can provide an early evaluation of the long-term citations, or the long-term influence, of academic papers.The model uses features available immediately after publication or after a certain period of time.Taking academic papers in Information Science and Library Science as our experimental subject, we train the model using three machine learning algorithms and find that the artificial neural network performs satisfactorily.Our findings may offer guidance for research management and decision-making.

The cosine similarity classifier is the most extensively utilized simple and efficient approach. It improves text classification performance. It is combined with estimated values provided by conventional classifiers such as Multinomial Naive Bayesian (MNB). Consequently, combining the similarity between a test document and a category with the estimated value for the category enhances the performance of the classifier. This approach provides a text document categorization method that is both efficient and effective. In addition, methods for determining the proper relationship between a set of words in a document and its document categorization is also obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

AB  - Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) is a globally recognised publication outlet for the field of Computer Science, including in South Africa. In this study, spanning from 1973 to 2022, we investigated the research participation of South African based authors in LNCS. The publication output and citation impact of these authors were compared to the global Computer Science and LNCS output. The authorship patterns and collaborative behaviour of South African LNCS papers were explored, and a keyword or topic analysis also conducted. Of the total of 518 662 LNCS papers published globally between 1973 and 2022, South African based researchers contributed 1150 papers (0.22%). The LNCS papers from South Africa exhibit a strong collaborative publication culture, with 1043 (91%) co-authored and 107 (9%) single-authored works. Local LNCS researchers prefer institutional collaboration (43%), followed by international (37%) and national collaboration (11%). Europe emerged as the most significant collaboration partner for LNCS researchers in South Africa. Of the 1150 papers, 836 (73%) had received citations, while 314 (27%) had not. On average, papers published by South African based authors received 6.05 citations, compared to the global LNCS average of 9.49 citations per paper. A keyword analysis revealed that the majority of papers by South African authors focus on artificial intelligence. The results indicate that, although LNCS serves as a reputable dissemination platform for Computer Science research output both globally and locally, South African authors should consider publishing more journal articles to build and improve their researcher profiles. Significance: The study shows that LNCS is the most frequent publication outlet for Computer Science researchers, globally and in South Africa. The study offers insight into the publication output, authorship patterns, collaborative behaviour and citation impact of South African based Computer Science researchers.

AB  - Document classification, a fundamental process within the field of natural language processing, has benefitted from the recent advancements in deep learning, particularly in enhancing accuracy.Traditional text clustering methods, such as bag-of-words models, exhibit domain specificity and struggle to handle vast data volumes.They also face limitations in elucidating sophisticated patterns and intricate word and phrase relationships within textual data.These constraints may adversely affect the accuracy of text clustering, subsequently impacting downstream applications like information retrieval, document classification, and natural language processing.This paper proposes a novel text classification model, termed Deep Contextual Embeddings Model (DCEM), designed to improve document classification accuracy.The DCEM integrates pre-trained deep contextual embedding architectures (e.g., GPT-2) with text clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means).It employs contextual embedding models to enhance document clustering accuracy by capturing context and semantic depth, improving data structure comprehension, and eliminating noise for more precise results.Experimental results, derived from the application of DCEM on AG News, Reuters-21578, and IMDB reviews datasets, indicate a significant improvement in document classification accuracy (81.09%), compared to traditional text clustering and document classification methods.

AB  - To enhance the effectiveness of matching user requests with millions of online products, practitioners invest significant efforts in developing semantic relevance models on large-scale e-commerce platforms. Generally, such semantic relevance models are formulated as text-matching approaches, which measure the relevance between users' search queries and the titles of candidate items (i.e., products). However, we argue that conventional relevance methods may lead to sub-optimal performance due to the limited information provided by the titles of candidate items. To alleviate this issue, we suggest incorporating additional information about candidate items from multiple aspects, including their attributes and images. This could supplement the information that may not be fully provided by titles alone. To this end, we propose a multi-aspect semantic relevance model that takes into account the match between search queries and the title, attribute and image information of items simultaneously. The model is further enhanced through pre-training using several well-designed self-supervised and weakly-supervised tasks. Furthermore, the proposed model is fine-tuned using annotated data and distilled into a representation-based architecture for efficient online deployment. Experimental results show the proposed approach significantly improves relevance and leads to considerable enhancements in business metrics.

AB  - With the advancement of technology, consumption of data and information over web is increasing day by day. This has led to rising dependence of our lives on internet data at personal and professional fronts. Being a populous nation with high internet penetration, India is a huge market in digital media. The adaptability to online news, has created a large number of text news data which requires classification into categories for further applications. To address the work for efficient news document classification in the field of computational linguistics, we have proposed a novel approach for Newsgroup classification by combining tokens with a context window size of one, two and three known as unigram, bigram and trigram respectively. &#x0D; In our research work, we explored the relevance of trigram by experimenting over different collection of n-grams using three supervised classifiers namely Perceptron, Nearest Centroid, and Random Forest. In the experiment, we found that inclusion of trigram along with unigram and bigram achieves the best result in terms of F1-macro score and accuracy among all three classifiers. Perceptron shows the best results in comparison with Random Forest and Perceptron classifiers, with an accuracy of 0.846945 and an F1-macro score of 0.83055. Significant time was spent on the validation of our efficient approach with the existing literature.

AB  - Abstract In the scientific community, there is no single, objective, and precise metric for ranking the work of researchers based on their scientific merit. Most existing metrics are based on the number of publications associated with an author along with the number of citations received by those publications. However, there is no standard metric officially used to evaluate the researchers’ careers. In this paper, the Framework for Reputation Estimation of Scientific Authors ( FRESA ) to address this issue is depicted. It is a system able to estimate the reputation of a researcher focusing on the achieved publications. It calculates two indexes making use of the relevance and the novelty concepts in the scientific domain. The system can depict the scientific trajectories of the researchers through the proposed indexes to illustrate their evolution over time. FRESA uses web information sources and applies similarity measures, text mining techniques, and clustering algorithms to also rank and group the researchers. The presented work is experimental, rendering promising results.

AB  - News text is an important branch of natural language processing. Compared to ordinary texts, news text has significant economic and scientific value. The characteristics of news text include structural hierarchy, diverse label categories, and limited high-quality annotation samples. Many machine learning and deep learning methods exist to analyze various forms of news text. However, due to label imbalance, hierarchical semantics, and confusing labels, current methods have limitations. Therefore, this paper proposes a news text classification framework based on hierarchical semantics and prior correction (HSPC). Firstly, data augmentation is used to enhance the diversity of the training set and adversarial learning is employed to improve the resistance of the model with its robustness. Then, a hierarchical feature extraction approach is employed to extract semantic features from different levels of news texts. Consequentially, a feature fusion method is designed to allow the model to focus on relevant hierarchical semantics for label classification. Finally, highly confusing label predictions are corrected to optimize the label prediction of the model and improve confidence. Multiple experiments are performed on four widely used public datasets. The experimental results indicate that HSPC achieves higher classification accuracy compared to other models. On the FCT, AGNews, THUCNews, and Ohsumed datasets, HSPC improves the accuracy by 1.03%, 1.38%, 2.55%, and 1.15%, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art methods. This validates the rationality and effectiveness of the designed mechanisms.

AB  - In a data-driven culture, in which analytics applications are the main resources for supporting decision-making, the use of high-quality datasets is mandatory to minimize errors and risks. For this reason, data analysis tasks need to be preceded by a data preparation pipeline. The design of such a pipeline is not trivial: the data analyst must carefully choose the appropriate operations considering several aspects. This is often performed by adopting a trial-and-error approach that does not always lead to the most effective solution. In addition, extracting information from social media poses specific problems due to the need to consider only posts relevant for the analysis, for its dependence from the context being considered, for its multimedia contents, and for the risk of filtering out informative posts with automatic filters. In this article, we propose a systematic approach to support the design of pipelines that are able to effectively extract a relevant dataset for the goal of the analysis of data from social media. We provide a conceptual model for designing and annotating the data preparation pipeline with quality and performance information, thus providing the data analyst preliminary information on the expected quality of the resulting dataset in a context-aware manner. The generation of metadata related to the processing tasks has been recognized as essential for enabling data sharing and reusability. To this aim, the dataset resulting from the pipeline application is automatically annotated with provenance metadata to get a detailed description of all the activities performed by the pipeline on them. As a case study, we consider the design of a pipeline for creating datasets of images extracted from social media in order to analyze behavioural aspects during COVID-19.

AB  - Within the scope of natural language processing, the domain of multi-label text classification is uniquely challenging due to its expansive and uneven label distribution. The complexity deepens due to the demand for an extensive set of annotated data for training an advanced deep learning model, especially in specialized fields where the labeling task can be labor-intensive and often requires domain-specific knowledge. Addressing these challenges, our study introduces a novel deep active learning strategy, capitalizing on the Beta family of proper scoring rules within the Expected Loss Reduction framework. It computes the expected increase in scores using the Beta Scoring Rules, which are then transformed into sample vector representations. These vector representations guide the diverse selection of informative sample, directly linking this process to the model's expected proper score. Comprehensive evaluations across both synthetic and real datasets reveal our method's capability to often outperform established acquisition techniques in multi-label text classification, presenting encouraging outcomes across various architectural and dataset scenarios.

AB  - The creation and dissemination of scientific knowledge have been widely studied.However, studies revealing the influence of peer collaboration on the productivity of academics with widely recognized performance remain scarce.The same can be said about the size of collaboration networks and the expected range of co-authors for maximizing scholarly productivity.In this sense, the present investigation aimed to analyze the possible collaboration-scientific production and collaboration-dissemination elasticities of knowledge.To this end data was collected on the scientific production and collaboration of the 500 authors of the most cited articles on Open Innovation, as well as of all 86 Nobel Laureates in Economics available in the Scopus database.The data was treated and analyzed using the simple regression statistical technique, based on the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method with the incorporation of nonlinearities, characterized by the use of a Log-Log Model.The results point out that collaboration among peers exerts significant influence on the production and dissemination of knowledge, even among the most prominent individuals in their fields, such as Nobel Laureates in Economics, confirming what is found in the literature on the subject.However, despite what the literature points out, especially concerning the idea that the larger the collaboration network, the higher the productivity, the results found suggest that collaboration networks have the same characteristics of an economic production function, to the extent that after a certain point, the addition of one more researcher in the network generates the effect of decreasing marginal productivity.

AB  - In the field of machine learning, multilabel learning gradually evolved from the traditional text classification problem. In this study, a multiview multilabel via optimal classifier chain (MVMLOCC) algorithm based on the nearest-neighbor model is proposed. The algorithm model establishes a multilabel chain classifier for each view of the dataset and predicts unknown data samples by dynamically adjusting the weights of chain learners. When an unknown example is input, multiple chain classifier models are multiplied by corresponding weights to obtain the final tag set situation. The model makes full use of the relevance between multiple tags and the complementarity and integrity between multiple perspectives and can achieve better learning results. The final experimental results show that our proposed model can be applied to different multilabel classification tasks and has achieved excellent performance under different evaluation indicators. This study mainly studies the multiview and multilabel classification method and uses active learning technology to solve the problem of high label components in data collection.

AB  - During the 1990s and first decade of the 2000s, problem-solving environments (PSEs) were a topic of research among a community with the vision to create software systems “with all of the computational facilities necessary to solve a target class of problems.” Use of the term has since declined, with fewer papers focused on core PSE research topics. What happened? Did we achieve the design vision for PSEs through other means – namely computational notebooks – or is there more to do? In this essay, we explore the history and objectives of PSE research, the rise of computational notebooks, whether they achieve these objectives, and why the time is right to renew our PSE research efforts.

AB  - Religious studies are a rich land for Natural Language Processing (NLP). The reason is that all religions have their instructions as written texts. In this paper, we apply NLP to Islamic Hadiths, which are the written traditions, sayings, actions, approvals, and discussions of the Prophet Muhammad, his companions, or his followers. A Hadith is composed of two parts: the chain of narrators (Sanad) and the content of the Hadith (Matn). A Hadith is transmitted from its author to a Hadith book author using a chain of narrators. The problem we solve focuses on the classification of Hadiths based on their origin of narration. This is important for several reasons. First, it helps determine the authenticity and reliability of the Hadiths. Second, it helps trace the chain of narration and identify the narrators involved in transmitting Hadiths. Finally, it helps understand the historical and cultural contexts in which Hadiths were transmitted, and the different levels of authority attributed to the narrators. To the best of our knowledge, and based on our literature review, this problem is not solved before using machine/deep learning approaches. To solve this classification problem, we created a novel Author-Based Hadith Classification Dataset (ABCD) collected from classical Hadiths’ books. The ABCD size is 29 K Hadiths and it contains unique 18 K narrators, with all their information. We applied machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) approaches. ML was applied on Sanad and Matn separately; then, we did the same with DL. The results revealed that ML performs better than DL using the Matn input data, with a 77% F1-score. DL performed better than ML using the Sanad input data, with a 92% F1-score. We used precision and recall alongside the F1-score; details of the results are explained at the end of the paper. We claim that the ABCD and the reported results will motivate the community to work in this new area. Our dataset and results will represent a baseline for further research on the same problem.

AB  - This environmental scan argues for the value in making grant proposals open access. Applying for and receiving grant funding is an important facet of research. However, accessing information on grant application, review, and award processes remains a particular challenge for early career scholars, researchers from smaller or under-resourced institutions, and traditionally marginalized scholars. While the open access movement has made research publications resulting from funded grants publicly available, grant proposals are rarely included. When proposals are shared, they are difficult to find due to variability in metadata implementation and quality. This work asks: What are central challenges in making grant proposals open access? How can increased access to grant proposals contribute to equity and transparency in funding distribution? What existing repositories contain grant materials? What standards and incentives can be established among grant-seeking and funding stakeholders to improve grant proposal accessibility? This work concludes with perspectives shared during a May 2022 advisory group meeting of stakeholders involved in the Institute of Museum and Library Services–funded project Planning for Open Grants, which focuses on potential solutions in grant seeking and funding processes for working toward an open grants standard across research communities.

AB  - Since 2020, when the coronavirus epidemic was at its peak, the Indonesian Ministry of Health's social media accounts have been constantly followed by a big number of individuals. The Indonesian Ministry of Health account is a fantastic resource for social media users, particularly Twitter users. The Republic of Indonesia's Ministry of Health's Twitter account publishes a wide range of content at random. As a result, it is usually difficult for Twitter users to determine the type of information provided by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia. The positive and negative responses of Twitter users to material released by the Indonesian Ministry of Health's Twitter account are frequently noted. The decision tree algorithm is tree-based, similar to the extreme gradient boosting method (XGBoost). The extreme gradient boosting approach has been successfully implemented with high performance in the classification process. This classification is separated into two primary categories: general and essential information categorization and sentiment analysis, which is classified into three classes: positive, neutral, and negative. Both the classification work and the sentiment analysis produced outstanding accuracy levels. Based on 2243 tweets, an accuracy rate of 89.35% has been achieved for classification, supported by a precision of 88.76% and a recall value of 88.58% when using 80 data training and 20 data testing. Similarly, the maximum accuracy in sentiment analysis was achieved utilizing the same 80-20 data partitioning, with a 91.22% accuracy rate. Using 304 comments data, accuracy was calculated to be 89.17% and recall was calculated to be 89.06%. It's worth noting that an 80-20 split for training and testing consistently produced the best results for both the sentiment analysis and classification tasks.

AB  - The Common Workflow Language (CWL) is a platform-independent description language for the representation of data science workflows consisting of a set of tasks that interact with each other to perform scientific analysis. The tasks can be packaged as Linux containers. On the one hand, using containers ensures the reproducibility and portability of workflows. Still, on the other hand, it limits each task to exploiting, at most, the resources of the host where its container runs. In this paper, we propose CWL-PLAS, an extension of CWL that allows a task to instantiate and temporarily use a supporting cloud platform for parallel computing, which is specialized for the task’s activity. In this way, tasks can leverage the resources of multiple hosts in parallel, reducing the duration of the workflow. We implemented an open-source workflow manager that supports CWL-PLAS workflows and exploits a Kubernetes back-end. We used this workflow manager to evaluate the performance of CWL-PLAS in a couple of machine learning workflows.

AB  - Abstract Globally available environmental observations (EOs), specifically from satellites and coupled Earth system models, represent some of the largest datasets of the digital age. As the volume of global EOs continues to grow, so does the potential of these data to help Earth scientists discover trends and patterns in Earth systems at large spatial scales. To leverage global EOs for scientific insight, Earth scientists need targeted and accessible exposure to skills in reproducible scientific computing and spatiotemporal data science, and to be empowered to apply their domain understanding to interpret data-driven models for knowledge discovery. The Generalizable, Reproducible, Robust, and Interpreted Environmental (GRRIEn) analysis framework was developed to prepare Earth scientists with an introductory statistics background and limited/no understanding of programming and computational methods to use global EOs to successfully generalize insights from local/regional field measurements across unsampled times and locations. GRRIEn analysis is generalizable, meaning results from a sample are translated to landscape scales by combining direct environmental measurements with global EOs using supervised machine learning; robust, meaning that the model shows good performance on data with scale-dependent feature and observation dependence; reproducible, based on a standard repository structure so that other scientists can quickly and easily replicate the analysis with a few computational tools; and interpreted, meaning that Earth scientists apply domain expertise to ensure that model parameters reflect a physically plausible diagnosis of the environmental system. This tutorial presents standard steps for achieving GRRIEn analysis by combining conventions of rigor in traditional experimental design with the open-science movement. Significance Statement Earth science researchers in the digital age are often tasked with pioneering big data analyses, yet have limited formal training in statistics and computational methods such as databasing or computer programming. Earth science researchers often spend tremendous amounts of time learning core computational skills, and making core analytical mistakes, in the process of bridging this training gap, at risk to the reputability of observational geostatistical research. The GRRIEn analytical framework is a practical guide introducing community standards for each phase of the computational research pipeline (dataset engineering, model training, and model diagnostics) to promote rigorous, accessible use of global EOs in Earth systems research.

AB  - Abstract As part of the UK university sector’s performance-related research funding model, the ‘REF’ (Research Excellence Framework), each discipline-derived ‘Unit of Assessment’ must submit a statement to provide information about their environment, culture, and strategy for enabling research and impact. Our aim in this paper is to identify the topics on which these statements focus, and how topic variation predicts funding-relevant research environment quality profiles. Using latent Dirichlet allocation topic modelling, we analysed all 1888 disciplinary ‘unit-level’ environment statements from REF2021. Our model identified eight topics which collectively predicted a surprisingly large proportion—58.9%—of the variance in units’ environment scores, indicating that the way in which statements were written contributed substantially to the perceived quality of a unit’s research environment. Assessing research environments will increase in importance in the next REF exercise and the insights found through our analysis may support reflection and discussion about what it means to have a high-quality research environment.

AB  - Abstract Software documentation is often neglected, impacting maintenance and reuse and leading to technical issues. In particular, when working with scientific software, such issues in the documentation pose a risk to producing reliable scientific results as they may cause improper or incorrect use of the software. R is a popular programming language for scientific software with a prolific package-based ecosystem, where users contribute packages (i.e., libraries). R packages are intended to be reused, and their users rely extensively on the available documentation. Thus, understanding what information developers provide in their packages’ documentation (generally, through a system known as Roxygen, based on Javadoc) is essential to contribute to it. This study mined 379 GitHub repositories of R packages and analysed a sample to develop a taxonomy of natural language descriptions used in Roxygen documentation. This was done through hybrid card sorting, which included two experienced R developers. The resulting taxonomy covers parameters, returns, and descriptions, providing a baseline for further studies. Our taxonomy is the first of its kind for R. Based on previous studies in pure object-oriented languages, our taxonomy could be extensible to other dynamically-typed languages used in scientific programming.

AB  - As the scale of scientific data analysis continues to grow, traditional domain-specific tools often struggle with data of increasing size and complexity. These tools also face sustainability challenges due to a relatively narrow user base, a limited pool of contributors, and constrained funding sources. We introduce the Pandata open-source software stack as a solution, emphasizing the use of domain-independent tools at critical stages of the data life cycle, without compromising the depth of domain-specific analyses. This set of interoperable and compositional tools, including Dask, Xarray, Numba, hvPlot, Panel, and Jupyter, provides a versatile and sustainable model for data analysis and scientific computation. Collectively, the Pandata stack covers the landscape of data access, distributed computation, and interactive visualization across any domain or scale.

AB  - Long Document Classification (LDC) has attracted great attention in Natural Language Processing and achieved considerable progress owing to the large-scale pre-trained language models. In spite of this, as a different problem from the traditional text classification, LDC is far from being settled. Long documents, such as news and articles, generally have more than thousands of words with complex structures. Moreover, compared with flat text, long documents usually contain multi-modal content of images, which provide rich information but not yet being utilized for classification. In this article, we propose a novel cross-modal method for long document classification, in which multiple granularity feature shifting networks are proposed to integrate the multi-scale text and visual features of long documents adaptively. Additionally, a multi-modal collaborative pooling block is proposed to eliminate redundant fine-grained text features and simultaneously reduce the computational complexity. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conduct experiments on the Food101 dataset and two constructed multi-modal long document datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed cross-modal method outperforms the single-modal text methods and defeats the state-of-the-art related multi-modal baselines.

AB  - The manufacturing industry of the future requires innovative approaches to optimize operational efficiency and adaptability. Integrating context-awareness into workflow management systems has emerged as a promising avenue to enhance efficiency in modern manufacturing processes. This research presents an innovative context-aware workflow management architecture designed to address industry-related challenges and overcome current limitations in the state-of-the-art. The architecture leverages Industry 4.0 standards for asset representation and workflow notation while incorporating a Context Analyzer component for real-time context interpretation. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is demonstrated in a real-world manufacturing setting, specifically in the scenario of collecting work order materials using the Robot Operating System (ROS) technology for robot navigation. The evaluation showcases improvements in task completion rate, resource utilization, and task completion time. These outcomes exemplify the potential benefits of incorporating context-awareness into manufacturing workflows, providing insights for further improvements. Contributions include advancing the understanding of context-aware workflow management, a review of the challenges that cap its adoption in the manufacturing domain, a qualitative comparison of similar approaches, practical implementation of the proposed architecture, evaluation of the context-aware component, and provision of the source code and datasets to the community for future advancement and reproducibility.

AB  - Current algorithmic fairness tools focus on auditing completed models, neglecting the potential downstream impacts of iterative decisions about cleaning data and training machine learning models. In response, we developed Retrograde, a JupyterLab environment extension for Python that generates real-time, contextual notifications for data scientists about decisions they are making regarding protected classes, proxy variables, missing data, and demographic differences in model performance. Our novel framework uses automated code analysis to trace data provenance in JupyterLab, enabling these notifications. In a between-subjects online experiment, 51 data scientists constructed loan-decision models with Retrograde providing notifications continuously throughout the process, only at the end, or never. Retrograde's notifications successfully nudged participants to account for missing data, avoid using protected classes as predictors, minimize demographic differences in model performance, and exhibit healthy skepticism about their models.

AB  - Context: When software is released publicly, it is common to include with it either the full text of the license or licenses under which it is published, or a detailed reference to them. Therefore public licenses, including FOSS (free, open source software) licenses, are usually publicly available in source code repositories.Objective: To compile a dataset containing as many documents as possible that contain the text of software licenses, or references to the license terms. Once compiled, characterize the dataset so that it can be used for further research, or practical purposes related to license analysis.Method: Retrieve from Software Heritage-the largest publicly available archive of FOSS source code-all versions of all files whose names are commonly used to convey licensing terms. All retrieved documents will be characterized in various ways, using automated and manual analyses.Results: The dataset consists of 6.9 million unique license files. Additional metadata about shipped license files is also provided, making the dataset ready to use in various contexts, including: file length measures, MIME type, SPDX license (detected using ScanCode), and oldest appearance. The results of a manual analysis of 8102 documents is also included, providing a ground truth for further analysis. The dataset is released as open data as an archive file containing all deduplicated license files, plus several portable CSV files with metadata, referencing files via cryptographic checksums.Conclusions: Thanks to the extensive coverage of Software Heritage, the dataset presented in this paper covers a very large fraction of all software licenses for public code. We have assembled a large body of software licenses, characterized it quantitatively and qualitatively, and validated that it is mostly composed of licensing information and includes almost all known license texts. The dataset can be used to conduct empirical studies on open source licensing, training of automated license classifiers, natural language processing (NLP) analyses of legal texts, as well as historical and phylogenetic studies on FOSS licensing. It can also be used in practice to improve tools detecting licenses in source code.

AB  - Abstract Data lineage allows information to be traced to its origin in data analysis by showing how the results were derived. Although many methods have been proposed to identify the source data from which the analysis results are derived, analysis is becoming increasingly complex both with regard to the target (e.g., images, videos, and texts) and technology (e.g., AI and machine learning (ML)). In such complex data analysis, simply showing the source data may not ensure traceability. For example, ML analysts building image classifier models often need to know which parts of images are relevant to the output and why the classifier made a decision. Recent studies have intensively investigated interpretability and explainability in the AI/ML domain. Integrating these techniques into the lineage framework will help analysts understand more precisely how the analysis results were derived and how the results are trustful. In this paper, we propose the concept of augmented lineage for this purpose, which is an extended lineage, and an efficient method to derive the augmented lineage for complex data analysis. We express complex data analysis flows using relational operators by combining user-defined functions (UDFs). UDFs can represent invocations of AI/ML models within the data analysis. Then, we present a method taking UDFs into consideration to derive the augmented lineage for arbitrarily chosen tuples among the analysis results. We also experimentally demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

RAIV also uses a client-server architecture to host and manage archived objects as online galleries, which users can use a standard web browser to experience without needing to install any additional software. RAIV supports intelligent search as well. When a search target has been found, RAIV can show the interaction path required to reach that target. We demonstrate RAIV's capability using a genomics web visualization system called KnowEnG from NCSA and publicly available census data visualizations from US Census.

AB  - Global English in Theoretical Mathematics: Citation Analysis Dr. Anna Friedman Abstract The article presents the results of the analysis of English in Math as an academic discipline claiming that English is currently the undisputed language of science and technology replacing the vernacular in scientific journals in many countries. The research reports on the percentage of the cited resources in English and other European languages used in the articles published in the leading American and European journals in the field of Theoretical Mathematics throughout the decade 2000-2010. The data includes 3499 citations from 179 articles. Only papers written in the same language as the language of the country in which this journal is published were analyzed. The categories of the citations are books and articles in English, German, French, and Italian. The findings show the follows: among Americans there is a tendency of decrease of English cited resources during the period from 2000 till 2010 - the continuing use of foreign-language sources by American scholars in these fields have been noted. Among other nations such as Germans, French and Italians, English remains the dominant language, and the continuing increase of the number of the cited resources in English has been observed, and the low use of foreign-language resources has been noted.

AB  - Natural disasters and epidemics are unfortunate recurring events that lead to huge societal and economic loss. Recent advances in supercomputing can facilitate simulations of such scenarios in (or even ahead of) real-time, therefore supporting the design of adequate responses by public authorities. By incorporating high-velocity data from sensors and modern high-performance computing systems, ensembles of simulations and advanced analysis enable urgent decision-makers to better monitor the disaster and to employ necessary actions (e.g., to evacuate populated areas) for mitigating these events. Unfortunately, frameworks to support such versatile and complex workflows for urgent decision-making are only rarely available and often lack in functionalities. This paper gives an overview of the VESTEC project and framework, which unifies orchestration, simulation, in-situ data analysis, and visualization of natural disasters that can be driven by external sensor data or interactive intervention by the user. We show how different components interact and work together in VESTEC and describe implementation details. To disseminate our experience three different types of disasters are evaluated: a Wildfire in La Jonquera (Spain), a Mosquito-Borne disease in two regions of Italy, and the magnetic reconnection in the Earth magnetosphere.
