abstract = {Topic modelling is a powerful text mining tool that has been applied in many fields such as software engineering, political and linguistic sciences. To evaluate the development of topic modelling studies, the present study reports a bibliometric analysis of SCIE, SSCI and A&amp;HCI listed articles published from 2000 and 2017. Bibliometric indices for productive authors, countries and institutions are analysed. In addition, thematic changes concerning topic modelling are also examined. Results show that China plays a leading role in this field. Topic modelling has established itself as an important technique in not only natural and formal sciences but also social sciences. LDA, social networks and text analysis are the topics with increasing popularity, while certain models (e.g. pLSA) and applications (e.g. topic detection) are declining in popularity. The findings could help researchers optimise research topic choices, seek collaboration with appropriate partners and stay up-to-date with the development of the field.},

abstract = {Blockchain video games, specifically video games using blockchain technology, are a trending topic in the media, technology community and business world. While blockchain video games are expected to transform the industry, little is known about how they are played and the players accordingly. The paper presents a 3-stage literature overview study on blockchain video games combining methods of topic modelling, bibliometric analysis, and narrative literature review. In a systematic approach, 1883 articles are screened. Language models are built on 1246 papers, and 70 articles directly related to blockchain video games have been analysed. The results indicate that most recent studies focus on blockchain technology and its financial characteristics instead of players. Hence, more play-oriented blockchain video game research is needed. Future studies may focus on different types of blockchain video games, game design and playability, players' experiences, and critical reviews.},

abstract = {Research on Educational Metaverse (Edu-Metaverse) has developed into an active research field. Based on 310 academic papers published from 2004 to 2022, this study identifies contributors, scientific cooperations, and research themes using bibliometrics, social network analysis, topic modeling, and keyword analysis. Results suggest that Edu-Metaverse has been gaining increasing attention in academia since 2019. Countries/affiliations located in the same regions are close partners in scientific cooperation. By jointly interpreting topic modeling and keyword analysis results, this study reveals eight main themes in the field of Edu-Metaverse: 1) Metaverse-based physical education; 2) Metaverse-supported simulations for collaborative problem-based learning (PBL) in health/medical education; 3) 3-D virtual learning environment-supported art appreciation and creation in art education; 4) Metaverse-enabled laboratories for STEM education; 5) language and 21st century skill development through Metaverse-supported immersive language learning; 6) Metaverse for developing autism children’ social communication abilities; 7) virtual world Metaverse-supported gameful experience-based education; and 8) quantitative research on Edu-Metaverse focusing on learners’ experience. We also identified challenges and directions needing further attention: 1) data security and privacy protection; 2) balance between the real world and virtual world identities; 3) preparing instructors for Edu-Metaverse; and 4) assessment of higher-order thinking competencies in Edu-Metaverse-based PBL. This work helps facilitate researchers’ and practitioners’ understanding of Edu-Metaverse research and raises their awareness of research frontiers and future directions.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) has started to attract attention as an important research topic in recent years. It is important to describe the CT field in detail and to determine the research interests and trends of studies in this field. In this most comprehensive and first topic modeling based study in the field of CT, it was aimed to determine the current situation and research interests and trends in the articles on CT from past to present. For this aim, articles containing the term “computational thinking” in the title, keywords and abstract were retrieved by a search on January 18, 2022 from Scopus database. As a result of the search, a total of 1083 articles related to CT published in the Scopus database as of the end of 2021 were obtained. The bibliometric analysis findings of the study showed that there has been a significant increase in the number of publications in this field, especially since 2015. Studies are mostly of United States origin. Although the studies are interdisciplinary, they have been published mainly in journals in the field of educational technologies. The topic modeling analysis showed that the articles in this field were grouped under 13 topics. The first three of these topics, in order of volume, are “Game based learning”, “Programming skills” and “Early child coding”, respectively. When the acceleration of the topics is examined, the first three, whose weight increased over time compared to other topics, came to the fore as “Programming skills”, “Early child coding” and “robotic programming”, respectively. As a result, it is expected that this study will guide future studies in terms of determining research interests and trends in the field of CT.},

abstract = {Finding potential collaborators has become a challenge due to the growing number of scientists in organizations such as universities, research institutes, or companies. Collaboration Recommendation Systems (CRSs) have been developed to help researchers identify possible collaboration partners, but they often rely on citation graphs or paper abstracts which may not be readily available in organizational databases or online sources. However, scientific publication titles provide consistent bibliometric data that can provide insights into research areas. TOMOSCO is a topic modelling framework that uses transformer-based methods to extract research area information from small amounts of text, such as publication titles or brief project descriptions. TOMOSCO can classify, cluster, and match research topics across different disciplines, uncovering relationships among scientists and suggesting potential interdisciplinary collaborations. In experiments, TOMOSCO was able to identify existing collaborations with over 90% accuracy based solely on publication titles and propose new collaborations based on previously unseen publications and project descriptions.},

abstract = {Text mining methods can find large scale trends within research communities. For example, using stable Latent Dirichlet Allocation (a topic modeling algorithm) this study found 10 major topics in 35,391 SE research papers from 34 leading SE venues over the last 25 years (divided, evenly, between conferences and journals). Out study also shows how those topics have changed over recent years. Also, we note that (in the historical record) mono-focusing on a single topic can lead to fewer citations than otherwise. Further, while we find no overall gender bias in SE authorship, we note that women are under-represented in the top-most cited papers in our field. Lastly, we show a previously unreported dichotomy between software conferences and journals (so research topics that succeed at conferences might not succeed at journals, and vice versa). An important aspect of this work is that it is automatic and quickly repeatable (unlike prior SE bibliometric studies that used tediously slow and labor intensive methods). Automation is important since, like any data mining study, its conclusions are skewed by the data used in the analysis. The automatic methods of this paper make it far easier for other researchers to re-apply the analysis to new data, or if they want to use different modeling assumptions.},

Based on 3900 LA articles published during the past decade, this study explores answers to questions such as “what research topics were the LA community interested in?” and “how did such research topics evolve?” by adopting structural topic modeling and bibliometrics. Major publication sources, countries/regions, institutions, and scientific collaborations were examined and visualized. Based on the analyses, we present suggestions for future LA research and discussions about important topics in the field. It is worth highlighting LA combining various innovative technologies (e.g., visual dashboards, neural networks, multimodal technologies, and open learner models) to support classroom orchestration, personalized recommendation/feedback, self-regulated learning in flipped classrooms, interaction in game-based and social learning. This work is useful in providing an overview of LA research, revealing the trends in LA practices, and suggesting future research directions.},

abstract = {The increasing concern of climate change and unstable oil prices induce the development of technological fuel in automobile industry. To investigate such a rapidly changing path, researchers apply bibliometrics and topic modeling to patent data. These commonly used methods, however, have several drawbacks such as considering macro-level trend only and focusing on high probable terms. To avoid these weaknesses, we propose the two-layer trend analysis based on Time country topic model (TCT) and Dirichlet compound multinomial model (DCM) that enable to detect both macro-level and micro-level trend and identify bursty terms in automotive industry. Experimental results show rising, falling and fluctuating trend topics on condition of countries using TCT model. We also find path of automotive technology based on bursty terms from the analysis of DCM model. Specifically, electric vehicle, aluminum in lightweight material and diesel engine are considered as rising topics in the automobile fuel. Our proposed framework can be applied to analyze the trajectory analysis in various other fields.},

abstract = {The diversity and advance of information, communication, and analytical technologies and their increasing adoption to assist instruction and learning give rise to various technology-driven conferences (e.g., artificial intelligence in education) in educational technology. Previous reviews on educational technology commonly focused on journal articles while seldom including mainstream conference papers which also contribute to an important part of scientific output in computer science and emerging disciplines like educational technology and are equally and even more important than articles in knowledge transmission. Hence, conference papers should also be included in bibliometric studies to produce a complete and precise picture of scientific production concerning educational technology. This study, therefore, uses bibliometrics and topic modeling to analyze papers from mainstream conferences, including Artificial Intelligence in Education, Learning Analytics and Knowledge, Educational Data Mining, Intelligent Tutoring System, and Learning at Scale, focusing on contributors, collaborations, and particularly research topics and topic evolutions to inform relevant stakeholders about educational technology’s development and its future. Results indicate promising areas like affective computing and behavior mining for adaptive instruction, recommender systems in personalized learning recommendations, eye-tracking for cognitive process diagnosis, videos for feedback provision, and natural language processing in discourse analysis and language education.},

Research on educational blockchain is also becoming an active field of research. Based on 206 studies published from 2017 to 2020, we identify contributors, collaborators, applications, and research topics using topic modeling and bibliometrics. Results indicate that currently, studies on the educational blockchain are mostly published in computer science conferences, with few in educational technology journals. Asian countries/regions (e.g., China and India) and institutions (e.g., University of Raharja) are active in this field. Countries/regions and institutions from the same regions tend to have close collaborations. Blockchain is mainly used to facilitate online testing and learning, education data mining and analytics, resource sharing, educational record verification and authentication, data management and storing, administration management, education/discipline of children, and college crowdfunding. Based on the results, we highlight the need to integrate artificial intelligence to enhance scalability and security and to facilitate justification and personalization of blockchain solutions based on accumulated big data to capture abnormal behaviors.

abstract = {This article reviews 26&nbsp;years (1994–2020) of research on electronic business published in reputable journals of the field. The basic aim behind this study is to define the growth potential of electronic business and marketing as a theoretical field and provide insights on past, present, and future scientific production in the field. By using bibliometrics and topic modeling techniques, annual scientific production and growth, latent topic structures, and trends by years, information on total citations and networks were examined. While the authors defined the research orientations by uncovering the main topics associated with electronic business, they created an understanding of the possible future research directions of fourteen topics discovered. The results show that, while the transaction-focused publications prevailed in the early years of electronic business and marketing journals, from the mid2000s, the focus has shifted towards marketing-focused publications. Moreover, to understand the main orientations in the field, the authors conducted a citation analysis to define the most influential topics published in the journals. The article also provides information on the most influential researchers in the field.},

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to provide a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications that employ text mining in management. To accomplish this, the authors collected 1282 documents from the Web of Science and performed performance analysis and science mapping with the help of the Bibliometrix package in Rstudio. The performance analysis used a range of bibliometric indicators such as productivity, citations, h-index, and m-quotient, in order to identify research trends and the most influential journals, authors, countries, and literature in the study. Science mapping used author keywords co-occurrence, co-authorship, and co-citation analysis to reflect the conceptual, social, and intellectual structure of the research. Specifically, we have seen an exponential increase in the use of text mining in management in recent years. The United States is the dominant country for research, having the earliest studies and the highest number of literature and citations. Furthermore, the research themes showed that topic modeling is at the forefront of current text mining research about management. This study will help scholars and management practitioners interested in the intersection of text mining and management to quickly understand the latest advances in research.},

abstract = {We examine how the introduction of a technology that automates research tasks influences the rate and type of researchers’ knowledge production. To do this, we leverage the unanticipated arrival of an automating motion-sensing research technology that occurred as a consequence of the introduction and subsequent hacking of the Microsoft Kinect system. To estimate whether this technology induces changes in the type of knowledge produced, we employ novel measures based on machine learning (topic modeling) techniques and traditional measures based on bibliometric indicators. Our analysis demonstrates that the shock associated with the introduction of Kinect increased the production of ideas and induced researchers to pursue ideas more diverse than and distant from their original trajectories. We find that this holds for both researchers who had published in motion-sensing research prior to the Kinect shock (within-area researchers) and those who did not (outside-area researchers), with the effects being stronger among outside-area researchers.},

abstract = {In the evaluation of scientific research, it is clear that 'scientific quality' is proving to be one of the most important criteria, and in the case of research for development, it is on an equal footing with another key dimension: relevance for development. The evaluation criteria and procedures are very similar to those applied in the evaluation of research in general: peer reviews, panels, bibliometric indices, etc ... The practical application of these tools in the case of research for development can sometimes be quite difficult. There is, however, a general consensus that quality should be expressed identically for any scientific research, with the same problems and constraints. In this article and to evaluate a scientific article, we thought to study the semantic relationship between the citing article and the other cited, we based on the Topic modeling theme with the choice of LDA and LDA2VEC algorithms applied to the corpus Nips (1987-2017) then on the citations of each article of the corpus.},

abstract = {Policymakers and funding agencies tend to support scientific work across disciplines, thereby relying on indicators for interdisciplinarity. Recently, text-based quantitative methods have been proposed for the computation of interdisciplinarity that hold promise to have several advantages over the bibliometric approach. In this paper, we provide a systematic analysis of the computation of the text-based Rao index, based on probabilistic topic models, comparing a classical LDA model versus a neural network topic model. We provide a systematic analysis of model parameters that affect the diversity scores and make the interaction between its different components explicit. We present an empirical study on a real data set, upon which we quantify the diversity of the research within several departments of Fraunhofer and Max Planck Society by means of scientific abstracts published in Scopus between 2008 and 2018. Our experiments show that parameter variations, i.e. the choice of the Number of topics, hyper-parameters, and size and balance of the underlying data used for training the model, have a strong effect on the topic model-based Rao metrics. In particular, we could observe that the quality&nbsp;of the&nbsp;topic&nbsp;models impacts on the downstream task of computing the Rao index.&nbsp;Topic models that yield semantically cohesive topics are less affected by fluctuations when varying over the number of topics, and result in more stable measurements of the Rao index.},

Previous research focused on the machine learning, network analysis and time series analysis based on the bibliometrics data and made a promising progress. However, these approaches inevitably have time delay problems. For the reason that leader papers of “emerging topics” share the similar characters with the “cover papers”, this study present a novel approach to translate the “emerging topics” detection to “cover paper” prediction. By using “AdaBoost model” and topic model, we construct a machine learning framework to imitate the top journal (chief) editor’s judgement to select cover paper from material science. The results of our prediction were validated by consulting with field experts. This approach was also suitable for the Nature, Science, and Cell journals.},

abstract = {Smart cities have become a new urban development paradigm and draw much interest from the research community and society. Based on academic publications of smart city-related research, this study employs bibliometrics, natural language machine learning methods to analyze 10,000 papers indexed by Web of Science from 2009 to 2020. Bibliometrics results show that: (1) A total of 114 countries or regions worldwide have participated in smart city research, and China is the country with the highest amount of participation in the field of smart cities. (2) Smart city research has gone through three stages: the initial stage (2009-2012), the in-depth advancement stage (2013-2016), and the leap-up stage (2017-2020). Researchers paid more attention to urban attractiveness indicators such as sustainability in the early stage. In the later period, most of the research topics were clustered on improving the overall function of the city. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model results revealed that research topics could be categorized into five aspects: policy research on the status quo of smart cities, data analysis and application, infrastructure construction, urban governance, and network security. Current research on smart city technologies mainly focuses on theoretical systems, technologies, and application fields. There is a lack of in-depth research and exploration in long-term construction and operation mechanisms. This research provides insight into the research status of smart city technologies and helps researchers decide on future study direction.},
