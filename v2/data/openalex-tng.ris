AB  - The increasing application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in health and medicine has attracted a great deal of research interest in recent decades. This study aims to provide a global and historical picture of research concerning AI in health and medicine. A total of 27,451 papers that were published between 1977 and 2018 (84.6% were dated 2008⁻2018) were retrieved from the Web of Science platform. The descriptive analysis examined the publication volume, and authors and countries collaboration. A global network of authors' keywords and content analysis of related scientific literature highlighted major techniques, including Robotic, Machine learning, Artificial neural network, Artificial intelligence, Natural language process, and their most frequent applications in Clinical Prediction and Treatment. The number of cancer-related publications was the highest, followed by Heart Diseases and Stroke, Vision impairment, Alzheimer's, and Depression. Moreover, the shortage in the research of AI application to some high burden diseases suggests future directions in AI research. This study offers a first and comprehensive picture of the global efforts directed towards this increasingly important and prolific field of research and suggests the development of global and national protocols and regulations on the justification and adaptation of medical AI products.

AB  - The objective of this study is to identify and analyze the scientific literature with a bibliometric analysis to find the main topics, authors, sources, most cited articles, and countries in the literature on virtual reality in education. Another aim is to understand the conceptual, intellectual, and social structure of the literature on the subject and identify the knowledge base of the use of VR in education and whether it is commonly used and integrated into teaching-learning processes. To do this, articles indexed in the Main Collections of the Web of Science, Scopus and Lens were analyzed for the period 2010 to 2021. The research results are presented in two parts: the first is a quantitative analysis that provides an overview of virtual reality (VR) technology used in the educational field, with tables, graphs, and maps, highlighting the main performance indicators for the production of articles and their citation. The results obtained found a total of 718 articles of which the following were analyzed 273 published articles. The second stage consisted of an inductive type of analysis that found six major groups in the cited articles, which are instruction and learning using VR, VR learning environments, use of VR in different fields of knowledge, learning processes using VR applications or games, learning processes employing simulation, and topics published during the Covid-19 pandemic. Another important aspect to mention is that VR is used in many different areas of education, but until the beginning of the pandemic the use of this so-called "disruptive process" came mainly from students, Institutions were reluctant and slow to accept and include VR in the teaching-learning processes.

AB  - Abstract Big data and analytics (BDA) are gaining momentum, particularly in the practitioner world. Research linking BDA to improved organizational performance seems scarce and widely dispersed though, with the majority focused on specific domains and/or macro‐level relationships. In order to synthesize past research and advance knowledge of the potential organizational value of BDA, the authors obtained a data set of 327 primary studies and 1252 secondary cited papers. This paper reviews this body of research, using three bibliometric methods. First, it elucidates its intellectual foundations via co‐citation analysis. Second, it visualizes the historical evolution of BDA and performance research and its substreams through algorithmic historiography. Third, it provides insights into the field's potential evolution via bibliographic coupling. The results reveal that the academic attention for the BDA–performance link has been increasing rapidly. The study uncovered ten research clusters that form the field's foundation. While research seems to have evolved following two main, isolated streams, the past decade has witnessed more cross‐disciplinary collaborations. Moreover, the study identified several research topics undergoing focused development, including financial and customer risk management, text mining and evolutionary algorithms. The review concludes with a discussion of the implications for different functional management domains and the gaps for both research and practice.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to offer a bibliometric and coding analysis of blockchain articles published in the accounting, auditing and accountability fields. Design/methodology/approach The data were collected using the Scopus database and a bibliometric and qualitative coding analysis with the keywords “blockchain” and “accounting” or “auditing” or “accountability.” Of the 514 initial sources, 93 peer-reviewed papers, book chapters and conference proceedings in the areas of business, management and accounting were finally selected. Nonscientific sources such as nonpeer-reviewed books and white papers were excluded. Findings This study reveals a promising and multidisciplinary field of research dominated by scholars and less by practitioners. Qualitative research, especially discourse analysis, is the most used method among authors. This study gives some useful insights about blockchain's definition and characteristics, business models, processes involved, connection with other technologies and relationships with accounting theories. Among the most interesting insights, the results confirm that technology as an external force can create an intersection among several research areas: accounting, auditing, accountability, business, management, computer science and engineering fields. Finally, in terms of research themes, although blockchain has a clear effect on auditing accounting, the links with the area of accountability are less clear and validated. Originality/value This study highlights the current state of the field, combining methodological approaches and providing valuable future research insights. Additionally, it is also a starting point for professionals to fully understand blockchain's characteristics and potential with a constructive and systemic approach.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques have been widely applied in depression research and treatment. Nonetheless, there is currently no systematic review or bibliometric analysis in the medical literature about the applications of AI in depression. We performed a bibliometric analysis of the current research landscape, which objectively evaluates the productivity of global researchers or institutions in this field, along with exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and latent dirichlet allocation (LDA). From 2010 onwards, the total number of papers and citations on using AI to manage depressive disorder have risen considerably. In terms of global AI research network, researchers from the United States were the major contributors to this field. Exploratory factor analysis showed that the most well-studied application of AI was the utilization of machine learning to identify clinical characteristics in depression, which accounted for more than 60% of all publications. Latent dirichlet allocation identified specific research themes, which include diagnosis accuracy, structural imaging techniques, gene testing, drug development, pattern recognition, and electroencephalography (EEG)-based diagnosis. Although the rapid development and widespread use of AI provide various benefits for both health providers and patients, interventions to enhance privacy and confidentiality issues are still limited and require further research.

AB  - Gamification has rapidly emerged as one of the favorite persuasive technologies widely used with the aim of promoting a positive change in the user's behavior by means of including game-like elements in non-game contexts. As a research discipline, gamification is growing fast, maturing from basic and fundamental questions such as what and why gamify to more mature ones such as how to gamify, when and when not, and still facing empirical and theoretical challenges to prove the effects of its practice and consolidate the principles that guide meaningful gamification designs. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a bibliometric study to describe how gamification as a scientific discipline is structured and how it has evolved over time. To do this, we make use of bibliometric performance analysis and science mapping methods to display and analyze the intellectual, conceptual and social network structures of gamification research, as well as the evolution and dynamical aspects of the discipline. The results reveal the research fronts and intellectual structures of the field, the internal relationships among articles, authors and keywords, the existing networks of collaboration, the emerging trends, the hot topics, and the most influential authors, publications and sources. Together, they picture the intellectual landscape of gamification as a scientific field that will be useful for junior and senior researchers, practitioners, funding agencies and policymakers.

AB  - Plastic materials have been crucial to the development of science, technology, and almost all aspects of modern progress since the mid-twentieth century. However, the increasingly unsustainable culture of plastic consumption and the accumulation of plastics in landfills, oceans, and broader ecosystems has also made negative, potentially irreversible environmental impacts. In recent decades, scientists and engineers have spent significant time and resources searching for more effective plastic waste management techniques based on thermochemical routes like pyrolysis. Indeed, plastic to fuel conversion has the potential to severely limit plastic pollution and to contribute to the circular economy, but industrial scale plastic pyrolysis has not been achieved. Therefore, this paper presents a bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review of pyrolysis-related articles in the Web of Science database published between 2001–2020. The resulting articles (n = 670) show that Spain is the most productive country in terms of total output and that there are an increasing number of researchers focused on this topic worldwide. The results also highlight the current landscape and future directions of plastic pyrolysis research based on the following hot topics: i) kinetic triplets as a vital component of plastic pyrolysis and scaling up processes, ii) catalysts syntheses and performance, iii) co-pyrolysis of plastic/biomass mixtures, and iv) reactor design and reaction parameters. In conclusion, the study offers a comprehensive overview of plastic pyrolysis progress, which will remain a major area of research for chemists and engineers in the coming decade and a powerful tool for environmental management.

AB  - Computer networking is a major research discipline in computer science, electrical engineering, and computer engineering. The field has been actively growing, in terms of both research and development, for the past hundred years. This study uses the article content and metadata of four important computer networking periodicals—IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials (COMST), IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON), ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communications (SIGCOMM), and IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)—obtained using ACM, IEEE Xplore, Scopus and CrossRef, for an 18-year period (2000–2017) to address important bibliometrics questions. All of the venues are prestigious, yet they publish quite different research. The first two of these periodicals (COMST and TON) are highly reputed journals of the fields while SIGCOMM and INFOCOM are considered top conferences of the field. SIGCOMM and INFOCOM publish new original research. TON has a similar genre and publishes new original research as well as the extended versions of different research published in the conferences such as SIGCOMM and INFOCOM, while COMST publishes surveys and reviews (which not only summarize previous works but highlight future research opportunities). In this study, we aim to track the co-evolution of trends in the COMST and TON journals and compare them to the publication trends in INFOCOM and SIGCOMM. Our analyses of the computer networking literature include: (a) metadata analysis; (b) content-based analysis; and (c) citation analysis. In addition, we identify the significant trends and the most influential authors, institutes and countries, based on the publication count as well as article citations. Through this study, we are proposing a methodology and framework for performing a comprehensive bibliometric analysis on computer networking research. To the best of our knowledge, no such study has been undertaken in computer networking until now.

AB  - Blockchain technology, and more specifically Bitcoin (one of its foremost applications), have been receiving increasing attention in the scientific community. The first publications with Bitcoin as a topic, can be traced back to 2012. In spite of this short time span, the production magnitude (1162 papers) makes it necessary to make a bibliometric study in order to observe research clusters, emerging topics, and leading scholars. Our paper is aimed at studying the scientific production only around bitcoin, excluding other blockchain applications. Thus, we restricted our search to papers indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection, whose topic is "bitcoin". This database is suitable for such diverse disciplines such as economics, engineering, mathematics, and computer science. This bibliometric study draws the landscape of the current state and trends of Bitcoin-related research in different scientific disciplines.

AB  - The applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in aiding clinical decision-making and management of stroke and heart diseases have become increasingly common in recent years, thanks in part to technological advancements and the heightened interest of the research and medical community. This study aims to provide a comprehensive picture of global trends and developments of AI applications relating to stroke and heart diseases, identifying research gaps and suggesting future directions for research and policy-making. A novel analysis approach that combined bibliometrics analysis with a more complex analysis of abstract content using exploratory factor analysis and Latent Dirichlet allocation, which uncovered emerging research domains and topics, was adopted. Data were extracted from the Web of Science database. Results showed topics with the most compelling growth to be AI for big data analysis, robotic prosthesis, robotics-assisted stroke rehabilitation, and minimally invasive surgery. The study also found an emerging landscape of research that was centered on population-specific and early detection of stroke and heart disease. Application of AI in health behavior tracking and improvement as well as the use of robotics in medical diagnostics and prognostication have also been found to attract significant research attention. In light of these findings, it is suggested that the currently under-researched issues of data management, AI model reliability, as well as validation of its clinical utility, need to be further explored in future research and policy decisions to maximize the benefits of AI applications in stroke and heart diseases.

AB  - Abstract In recent decades, data-driven landslide susceptibility models (DdLSM), which are based on statistical or machine learning approaches, have become popular to estimate the relative spatial probability of landslide occurrence. The available literature is composed of a wealth of published studies and that has identified a large variety of challenges and innovations in this field. This review presents a comprehensive up-to-date overview focusing on the topic of DdLSM. This research begins with an introduction of the theoretical aspects of DdLSM research and is followed by an in-depth bibliometric analysis of 2585 publications. This analysis is based on the Web of Science, Clarivate Analytics database and provides insights into the transient characteristics and research trends within published spatial landslide assessments. Following the bibliometric analysis, a more detailed review of the most recent publications from 1985 to 2020 is given. A variety of different criteria are explored in detail, including research design, study area extent, inventory characteristics, classification algorithms, predictors utilized, and validation technique performed. This section, dealing with a quantitative-oriented review expands the time-frame of the review publication done by Reichenbach et al. in 2018 by also accounting for the four years, 2017–2020. The originality of this research is acknowledged by combining together: (a) a recap of important theoretical aspects of DdLSM; (b) a bibliometric analysis on the topic; (c) a quantitative-oriented review of relevant publications; and (d) a systematic summary of the findings, indicating important aspects and potential developments related to the DdLSM research topic. The results show that DdLSM are used within a wide range of applications with study area extents ranging from a few kilometers to national and even continental scales. In more than 70% of publications, a combination of the predictors, slope angle, aspect and geology are used. Simple classifiers, such as, logistic regression or approaches based on frequency ratio are still popular, despite the upcoming trend of applying machine learning algorithms. When analyzing validation techniques, 38% of the publications were not clear about the validation method used. Within the studies that included validation techniques, the AUROC was the most popular validation metric, being used accounting for 44% of the studies. Finally, it can be concluded that the application of new classification techniques is often cited as a main research scope, even though the most relevant innovation could also lie in tackling data-quality issues and research designs adaptations to fit the input data particularities in order to improve prediction quality.

AB  - As urbanization continues to accelerate, the number of cities and their growing populations have created problems, such as the congestion and noise related to transportation, the pollution from industry, and the difficulty of disposing of garbage. An emerging urban strategy is to make use of digital technologies and big data to help improve the quality of life of urban residents. In the past decade, more and more researchers have studied smart cities, and the number of literature in this field grows rapidly, making it “big data”. With the aim of better understanding the contexts of smart-city research, including the distribution of topics, knowledge bases, and the research frontiers in the field, this paper is based on the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) in the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection, and the method used is that of comprehensive scientometric analysis and knowledge mapping in terms of diversity, time slicing, and dynamics, using VOSviewer and CiteSpace to study the literature in the field. The main research topics can be divided into three areas—“the concepts and elements of the smart city”, “the smart city and the Internet of Things”, and “the smart city of the future”—through document co-citation analysis. There are four key directions—“research objectives and development-strategy research”, “technical-support research”, “data-processing and applied research”, and “management and applied research”—analyzed using keywords co-occurrence. Finally, the research frontiers are urban-development, sustainable cities, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, integration, undertaken through keyword co-occurrence analysis.

AB  - Oil spill detection and mapping (OSPM) is an extremely relevant issue from a scientific point of view due to the environmental impact on coastal and marine ecosystems. In this study, we present a new approach to assess scientific literature for the past 50 years. In this sense, our study aims to perform a bibliometric and network analysis using a literature review on the application of OSPM to assess researchers and trends in this field of science. In methodological terms we used the Scopus base to search for articles in the literature, then we used bibliometric tools to access information and reveal quantifying patterns in this field of literature. Our results suggest that the detection of oil in the sea has undergone a great evolution in the last decades and there is a strong relationship between the technological evolution aimed at detection with the improvement of remote sensing data acquisition methods. The most relevant contributions in this field of science involved countries such as China, the United States, and Canada. We revealed aspects of great importance and interest in OSPM literature using a bibliometric and network approach to give a clear overview of this field’s research trends.

AB  - With the rapid development of technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely used in the diagnosis and prognosis prediction of a variety of diseases, including prostate cancer. Facts have proved that AI has broad prospects in the accurate diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.This study mainly summarizes the research on the application of artificial intelligence in the field of prostate cancer through bibliometric analysis and explores possible future research hotspots.The articles and reviews regarding application of AI in prostate cancer between 1999 and 2020 were selected from Web of Science Core Collection on August 23, 2021. Microsoft Excel 2019 and GraphPad Prism 8 were applied to analyze the targeted variables. VOSviewer (version 1.6.16), Citespace (version 5.8.R2), and a widely used online bibliometric platform were used to conduct co-authorship, co-citation, and co-occurrence analysis of countries, institutions, authors, references, and keywords in this field.A total of 2,749 articles were selected in this study. AI-related research on prostate cancer increased exponentially in recent years, of which the USA was the most productive country with 1,342 publications, and had close cooperation with many countries. The most productive institution and researcher were the Henry Ford Health System and Tewari. However, the cooperation among most institutions or researchers was not close even if the high research outputs. The result of keyword analysis could divide all studies into three clusters: "Diagnosis and Prediction AI-related study", "Non-surgery AI-related study", and "Surgery AI-related study". Meanwhile, the current research hotspots were "deep learning" and "multiparametric MRI".Artificial intelligence has broad application prospects in prostate cancer, and a growing number of scholars are devoted to AI-related research on prostate cancer. Meanwhile, the cooperation among various countries and institutions needs to be strengthened in the future. It can be projected that noninvasive diagnosis and accurate minimally invasive treatment through deep learning technology will still be the research focus in the next few years.

AB  - In order to analyse the research evolution and knowledge frontier in the research of marine accidents, 491 literatures on marine accidents in the Web of Science database from 2000 to 2022 are taken as data sources. Integrated with literature analysis of traditional method, CiteSpace and VOSviewer are then jointly used for the development of the knowledge network map and cluster analysis, and the knowledge of network map, research hotpots, research evolution and knowledge frontiers is obtained. It is found that there is a close cooperative relationship among journals, researchers, research institutions and countries or regions. According to the subjects and methods, the study of marine accidents can be divided into two parts: the analysis of the influential factors and accident consequences, as well as the methodology development of traditional and emerging technology. In this context, the analysis of human factors in remote-controlled ships, the prevention of accidents in Arctic waters have become research hotspots, while emerging accident analysis methods such as machine learning and big data mining also have shown powerful insights in the analysis of marine accidents. In terms of innovation, the bibliometric approach enhances the ability to handle large literature databases and conduct network analysis. Moreover, this study visualises collaborative networks, analyses evolution trends, reveals the research hotpots, and conducts a comparison and discussion of mainstream approaches in marine accident research. As a result, this study provides a theoretical basis and implementation direction for the development of maritime safety.

AB  - Dimensions was built as a platform to allow stakeholders in the research community, including academic bibliometricians, to more easily create and understand the context of different types of research object through the linkages between these objects. Links between objects are created via persistent identifiers and machine learning techniques, while additional context is introduced via data enhancements such as per-object categorisations and person and institution disambiguation. While these features make analytical use cases accessible for end users, the COVID-19 crisis has highlighted a different set of needs to analyze trends in scholarship as they occur: Real-time bibliometrics. The combination of full-text search, daily data updates, a broad set of scholarly objects including pre-prints and a wider set of data fields for analysis, broadens opportunities for a different style of analysis. A subset of these emerging capabilities is discussed and three basic analyses are presented as illustrations of the potential for real-time bibliometrics.

AB  - Product Returns (PR) are an inevitable yet costly process in business, especially in the online marketplace. How to deal with the conundrums has attracted a great deal of attention from both practitioners and researchers. This paper aims to synthesise research developments in the PR domain in order to provide an insightful picture of current research and explore future directions for the research community. To ensure research rigour, we adapt a six-step framework - defining the topic, searching databases, cleaning and clustering data, paper selection, content analysis, and discussion. A hybrid approach is adopted for clustering and identifying the distribution and themes in a large number of publications collected from academic databases. The hybrid approach combines machine learning topic modelling and bibliometric analysis. The machine learning results indicate that the overall research can be clustered into three groups: (1) operations management of PR, covering (re)manufacturing network design, product recovery, reverse distribution, and quality of cores; (2) retailer and (re)manufacturer issues including return policy, channel, inventory, pricing, and information strategies; and (3) customer's psychology, experience, and perception on marketing-operation interface. Furthermore, from the content analysis, five potential future directions are discussed, namely digitalisation in the context of PR; globalisation versus localisation in the context of PR; multi-layer (i.e., retailer, manufacturer, logistics provider, online platform) and multi-channel (i.e., online, offline, dual and omni channel) oriented bespoke return policy; understanding and predicting customer return behaviour via online footprints; and customer return perception across the marketing–operations interface.

AB  - Adaptation and innovation are extremely important to the manufacturing industry. This development should lead to sustainable manufacturing using new technologies. To promote sustainability, smart production requires global perspectives of smart production application technology. In this regard, thanks to intensive research efforts in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), a number of AI-based techniques, such as machine learning, have already been established in the industry to achieve sustainable manufacturing. Thus, the aim of the present research was to analyze, systematically, the scientific literature relating to the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) in industry. In fact, with the introduction of the Industry 4.0, artificial intelligence and machine learning are considered the driving force of smart factory revolution. The purpose of this review was to classify the literature, including publication year, authors, scientific sector, country, institution, and keywords. The analysis was done using the Web of Science and SCOPUS database. Furthermore, UCINET and NVivo 12 software were used to complete them. A literature review on ML and AI empirical studies published in the last century was carried out to highlight the evolution of the topic before and after Industry 4.0 introduction, from 1999 to now. Eighty-two articles were reviewed and classified. A first interesting result is the greater number of works published by the USA and the increasing interest after the birth of Industry 4.0.

AB  - Green finance (GF) supports the global fight against climate change and its impacts. It is critical to attaining the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Since GF is regarded as the future of finance and investment, it needs to be fully understood. This paper presents the first mixed-methods systematic review with both bibliometric and qualitative analysis of the state-of-the-art and trends in GF research. A bibliometric review was performed to quantitatively examine 995 related publications retrieved from Scopus and validated with the Web of Science, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect. Results showed that GF is still relatively an immature but interdisciplinary research area. A further qualitative-systematic analysis of 60 selected publications was conducted to identify the key findings, challenges, and recommendations for future research. Findings revealed six major research hotspots in GF: (i) green bond market and greenium, (ii) green credit (loan), (iii) carbon investment and market, (iv) green banking, (v) market stress (e.g. the COVID-19 pandemic) and GF, and (vi) domestic and international climate finance policies. This study provides insights into key applications of GF as it applies to specific research fields, a and as the pathways to realize the accruable benefits of GF to enhance research and development.

AB  - With unorganized, unplanned and improper use of limited raw materials, an abundant amount of waste is being produced, which is harmful to our environment and ecosystem. While traditional linear production lines fail to address far-reaching issues like waste production and a shorter product life cycle, a prospective concept, namely circular economy (CE), has shown promising prospects to be adopted at industrial and governmental levels. CE aims to complete the product life cycle loop by bringing out the highest values from raw materials in the design phase and later on by reusing, recycling, and remanufacturing. Innovative technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning(ML) provide vital assistance in effectively adopting and implementing CE in real-world practices. This study explores the adoption and integration of applied AI techniques in CE. First, we conducted bibliometric analysis on a collection of 104 SCOPUS indexed documents exploring the critical research criteria in AI and CE. Forty papers were picked to conduct a systematic literature review from these documents. The selected documents were further divided into six categories: sustainable development, reverse logistics, waste management, supply chain management, recycle &amp; reuse, and manufacturing development. Comprehensive research insights and trends have been extracted and delineated. Finally, the research gap needing further attention has been identified and the future research directions have also been discussed.

AB  - Every data and kind of data need a physical drive to store it. There has been an explosion in the volume of images, video, and other similar data types circulated over the internet. Users using the internet expect intelligible data, even under the pressure of multiple resource constraints such as bandwidth bottleneck and noisy channels. Therefore, data compression is becoming a fundamental problem in wider engineering communities. There has been some related work on data compression using neural networks. Various machine learning approaches are currently applied in data compression techniques and tested to obtain better lossy and lossless compression results. A very efficient and variety of research is already available for image compression. However, this is not the case for video compression. Because of the explosion of big data and the excess use of cameras in various places globally, around 82% of the data generated involve videos. Proposed approaches have used Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and various variants of Autoencoders (AEs) are used in their approaches. All newly proposed methods aim to increase performance (reducing bitrate up to 50% at the same data quality and complexity). This paper presents a bibliometric analysis and literature survey of all Deep Learning (DL) methods used in video compression in recent years. Scopus and Web of Science are well-known research databases. The results retrieved from them are used for this analytical study. Two types of analysis are performed on the extracted documents. They include quantitative and qualitative results. In quantitative analysis, records are analyzed based on their citations, keywords, source of publication, and country of publication. The qualitative analysis provides information on DL-based approaches for video compression, as well as the advantages, disadvantages, and challenges of using them.

AB  - This paper presents an integrated and easy methodology for bibliometric analysis. The proposed methodology is evaluated on recent research activities to highlight the role of the Internet of Things in healthcare applications. Different tools are used for bibliometric studies to explore the breadth and depth of different research areas. However, these Methods consider only the Web of Science or Scopus data for bibliometric analysis. Furthermore, bibliometric analysis has not been fully utilised to examine the capabilities of the Internet of Things for medical devices and their applications. There is a need for an easy methodology to use for a single integrated analysis of data from many sources rather than just the Web of Science or Scopus. A few bibliometric studies merge the Web of Science and Scopus to conduct a single integrated piece of research. This paper presents a methodology that could be used for a single bibliometric analysis across multiple databases. Three freely available tools, Excel, Perish or Publish and the R package Bibliometrix, are used for the purpose. The proposed bibliometric methodology is evaluated for studies related to the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and its applications in healthcare settings. An inclusion/exclusion criterion is developed to explore relevant studies from the seven largest databases, including Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE, ACM digital library, PubMed, Science Direct and Google Scholar. The study focuses on factors such as the number of publications, citations per paper, collaborative research output, h-Index, primary research and healthcare application areas. Data for this study are collected from the seven largest academic databases for 2012 to 2022 related to IoMT and their applications in healthcare. The bibliometric data analysis generated different research themes within IoMT technologies and their applications in healthcare research.

AB  - Abstract This manuscript explores the research topics and collaborative behaviour of authors in the field of the Prisoner’s Dilemma using topic modeling and a graph theoretic analysis of the co-authorship network. The analysis identified five research topics in the Prisoner’s Dilemma which have been relevant over the course of time. These are human subject research, biological studies, strategies, evolutionary dynamics on networks and modeling problems as a Prisoner’s Dilemma game. Moreover, the results demonstrated the Prisoner’s Dilemma is a field of continued interest, and that it is a collaborative field compared to other game theoretic fields. The co-authorship network suggests that authors are focused on their communities and that not many connections across the communities are made. The most central authors of the network are the authors connected to the main cluster. Through examining the networks of topics, it was uncovered that the main cluster is characterised by the collaboration of authors in a single topic. These findings add to the bibliometrics study in another field and present new questions and avenues of research to understand the reasons for the measured behaviours.

AB  - Logistics activities were included in the wave of changes brought with the advent of the fourth industrial revolution. Several applications can be recognized for several activities, aiming all at efficiently optimizing processes and consequently production and volumes. Among them, collaborative robots involved for instance in picking, palletizing or assembly operations are quickly spreading, as also demonstrated by the increase in the number of publications available in literature. In response, this paper presents the results of a bibliometric analysis carried out on 64 scientific papers which deal with this topic within the logistics field. Analysis were made through two different software applications, namely Microsoft Excel™ and VOSviewer. Results are quite optimistic as they delineate great opportunities for collaborative robots to establish their position in the industrial context.

AB  - Chemometrics has been defined as the discipline that provides maximum information from chemical data. Food science and technology applications use chemical data and are therefore suitable for chemometrics evaluation. Bibliometric studies provide an enhanced understanding of the progression, research status as well as future trends of a research field. The main aim of the study was therefore, to provide a bibliometric evaluation of the research literature employing chemometrics techniques in food science and technology applications. For this, a search strategy including the single term chemometric∗ was performed. The metadata obtained from the bibliometric search was subsequently analyzed. Indicators of the scientific productivity and quality such as the number of articles, citations, or funding activity, were obtained in combination with the most relevant keywords, authors, and countries. The progression over time of the bibliometric indicators was also presented and discussed. Chemometrics appeared as a prolific and healthy research field with increased funding received in the last decade. PCA, PLS and DA are still the preferred methods for most applications. A big part of the research is related to the combined use of spectroscopy and chemometrics. Finally, China and Brazil appeared as the leading countries in applying chemometrics to foodstuffs.

AB  - Today, manufacturing enterprises are adopting emerging Industry 4.0 technologies to create industrial intelligence-driven smart factories. This trend, in turn, is stimulating the advent of intelligent supply chains that can sync and support the rapid evolution of advanced industrial practices via supply chain digital transformation. Specifically, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are emerging as vital breakthrough technologies that can help firms enhance profit margins, reduce supply chain costs, deliver excellent customer service, and make their supply chains intelligent. This paper identifies and analyzes 338 most influential research papers to scientifically examine the linkages among the AI-ML techniques and their applications in the SCM domain through bibliometric and network analysis, descriptive data analysis, and visual representation, thus furnishing a perspicacious knowledge base. The main contribution of this paper is to identify the unexplored potential and the contexts in which AI and ML can be used in managing and transforming supply chains digitally, including the aspects of intelligent and interpretative evolutions. Additionally, a fundamental contribution of this work is a comprehensive mind map that makes it possible to visualize, understand, and simulate the wide spectrum of findings from the bibliometric analyses. Finally, the study presents research gaps, implications, and future scope as a point of reference for researchers and practitioners.

AB  - Digital transformation is becoming an integral component of sustainable development for different scales of activity: meta-, mega-, macro, meso-, and microlevels. The aim of the article is to identify the relationship between sustainable development and digital transformation by characterising the evolution of key patterns of scientific publications on this issue. The goal is achieved by forming a relevant sample of scientific articles based on the identification of periods of publication activity, as well as by performing bibliometric analysis of keywords coincidence to identify promising areas of research in this area. On the one hand, categories such as "sustainable development" or "sustainability" and, on the other hand, categories describing digital transformation. The generated sample of publications for the study includes 9,527 articles and conference papers indexed by the scientific metrics database Scopus for the period 1990-2023. The bibliometric analysis and visualisation of its results were carried out using the VOSviewer software product. On the basis of the visualisation maps, five clusters were identified and characterised based on the meaningful coincidence of keywords in articles and five stages of evolutionary development of the issues of sustainable development and digitalisation. Based on the analysis of empirical data, exponential growth in the number of publications in the context of the relationship between digital technologies and economic, environmental and social sustainability was confirmed (the annual increase in the number of articles on this topic is 36%). The results of the analysis can be used in future research related to sustainable development and digital transformation.

AB  - This paper explores the state of the art in the cryptocurrency literature, with a special emphasis on the links between financial dimensions and ESG features. The study uses bibliometric analysis to illustrate the history of cryptocurrency publication activity, focusing on the most popular subjects and research trends. Between 2014 and 2021, 1442 papers on cryptocurrencies were published in the Web of Science core collection, the most authoritative database, although only a tiny percentage evaluated ESG factors. One of the most common criticisms of cryptocurrencies is the pollution derived from energy consumption in their mining process and their use for illicit purposes due to the absence of effective regulation. The study allows us to suggest future research directions that may be beneficial in illustrating the environmental effect, studying financial behavior, identifying the long-term sustainability of cryptocurrencies, and evaluating their financial success. This study provides an in-depth examination of current research trends in the field of cryptocurrencies, identifying prospective future research directions.

AB  - This paper surveys the extant literature on machine learning, artificial intelligence, and deep learning mechanisms within the financial sphere using bibliometric methods. We considered the conceptual and social structure of publications in ML, AI, and DL in finance to better understand the research's status, development, and growth. The study finds an upsurge in publication trends within this research arena, with a bit of concentration around the financial domain. The institutional contributions from USA and China constitute much of the literature on applying ML and AI in finance. Our analysis identifies emerging research themes, with the most futuristic being ESG scoring using ML and AI. However, we find there is a lack of empirical academic research with a critical appraisal of these algorithmic-based advanced automated financial technologies. There are severe pitfalls in the prediction process using ML and AI due to algorithmic biases, mostly in the areas of insurance, credit scoring and mortgages. Thus, this study indicates the next evolution of ML and DL archetypes in the economic sphere and the need for a strategic turnaround in academics regarding these forces of disruption and innovation that are shaping the future of finance.

AB  - Abstract Among the declining industries, for example music industry, some have been revived by information technology (IT). At the same time, in academic fields, some have expected co-evolutions between IT and other fields to cause the resurgence of either field. In this research, the clustering of citation networks with 14,438 academic papers resulted in the identification of 28 academic fields in the areas “Computer Science” or “Information Science and Library Science.” Co-evolutions between these 28 fields and citing fields to the 28 fields were evaluated by an investigation of contents; a methodology to search co-evolutions was also proposed. This paper proposes that pairs of academic fields (with both high correlation and high dissimilarity) co-evolve, and some co-evolving pairs of academic fields were found. This research contributes to the discovery of the co-evolution between academic fields.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a field of knowledge that is displacing and disrupting technologies, leading to changes in human life. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to scientifically map this topic and its ramifications, in order to analyze its growth. The study was developed under the bibliometric approach and considered the period 1990-2019. The steps followed were (i) Identification and selection of keyword terms in three methodological layers by a panel of experts. (ii) Design and application of an algorithm to identify these selected keywords in titles, abstracts, and keywords using terms in Web of Science to contrast them. (iii) Performing data processing based on the Journals of the Journal Citation Report during 2020. Knowing the evolution of a field of knowledge such as AI from a bibliometric study and subsequently establishing the ramifications of new research streams is in itself a relevant finding. Addressing a broad field of knowledge as AI from a multidisciplinary approach given the convergence it generates with other disciplines and specialties is of high strategic value for decision makers such as governments, academics, scientists, and entrepreneurs.

AB  - Smartphones have become an integral part of our lives with unprecedented popularity and a diverse selection of apps. The continuous upgrading of information technology has also enabled smartphones to display great potential in the field of health care.We aimed to determine the future research direction of mobile health (mHealth) by analyzing its research trends and latest research hotspots.This study collected mHealth-related literature published between 2000 and 2020 from the Web of Science database. Descriptive statistics of publication trends of mHealth research were determined by analyzing the annual number of publications in the literature and annual number of publications by country. We constructed visualization network maps of country (or regional) collaborations and author-provided keyword co-occurrences, as well as overlay visualization maps of the average publication year of author-provided keywords to analyze the hotspots and research trends in mHealth research.In total, 12,593 mHealth-related research papers published between 2000 and 2020 were found. The results showed an exponential growth trend in the number of annual publications in mHealth literature. JMIR mHealth and uHealth, the Journal of Medical Internet Research, and JMIR Research Protocols were the 3 top journals with respect to number of publications. The United States remained the leading contributor to the literature in this area (5294/12,593, 42.0%), well ahead of other countries and regions. Other countries and regions also showed a clear trend of annual increases in the number of mHealth publications. The 4 countries with the largest number of publications-the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia-were found to cooperate more closely. The rest of the countries and regions showed a clear geographic pattern of cooperation. The keyword co-occurrence analysis of the top 100 authors demonstrated 5 clusters, namely, development of mHealth medical technology and its application to various diseases, use of mHealth technology to improve basic public health and health policy, mHealth self-health testing and management in daily life, adolescent use of mHealth, and mHealth in mental health. The research trends revealed a gradual shift in mHealth research from health policy and improving public health care to the development and social application of mHealth technologies.To the best of our knowledge, the most current bibliometric analysis dates back to 2016. However, the number of mHealth research published between 2017 and 2020 exceeds the previous total. The results of this study shed light on the latest hotspots and trends in mHealth research. These findings provide a useful overview of the development of the field; they may also serve as a valuable reference and provide guidance for researchers in the digital health field.

AB  - Known as the third revolution of information technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) embodies the transformation of human technology from “virtual” to “reality.” The application of IoT in education has risen the concerns of both researchers and practitioners. However, there are few research on using bibliometric to visually analyze the hotspots and trends of the IoT in education. In this study, a total of 2257 articles, including (i) 1243 domestic articles from 2005 to 2021; and (ii) 1014 foreign articles from 2005 to 2021, were collected for comparative analysis between China and foreign using the visualization software CiteSpace. The results show that authoritative journals both at home and abroad have paid varying degrees of attentions to the basic theories, emerging technologies and applications of IoT in education. The number of research literature on this topic is generally increasing year by year. It is particularly worth mentioning that for countries/regions that actively participate in this field, on the one hand, the United States, China and Spain are the top three major countries on the IoT in education, and their international academic cooperation is relatively close; on the other hand, the main research findings are concentrated in the northern hemisphere and eastern hemisphere while there is less distribution in the southern hemisphere and western hemisphere. Regarding to research directions, on the whole, much attention has been paid to the construction of smart learning environment; to be specific, its research focus has shifted to the deep integration of intelligent technology and education (e.g., IoT technology supports students’ learning feedback to improve teaching effect). However, in general, the application of IoT in education is still in its infancy, and the scope of practical application is relatively limited. Therefore, future research will concentrate on the integration of curriculum teaching, education evaluation and innovation-oriented supported by technologies such as IoT in order to inaugurate a new world for carrying out experimental teaching, presenting abstract concepts, and connecting realistic situations.

AB  - Because of their cross-functional nature in the company, enhancing Production Planning and Control (PPC) functions can lead to a global improvement of manufacturing systems. With the advent of the Industry 4.0 (I4.0), copious availability of data, high-computing power and large storage capacity have made of Machine Learning (ML) approaches an appealing solution to tackle manufacturing challenges. As such, this paper presents a state-of-the-art of ML-aided PPC (ML-PPC) done through a systematic literature review analyzing 93 recent research application articles. This study has two main objectives: contribute to the definition of a methodology to implement ML-PPC and propose a mapping to classify the scientific literature to identify further research perspectives. To achieve the first objective, ML techniques, tools, activities, and data sources which are required to implement a ML-PPC are reviewed. The second objective is developed through the analysis of the use cases and the addressed characteristics of the I4.0. Results suggest that 75% of the possible research domains in ML-PPC are barely explored or not addressed at all. This lack of research originates from two possible causes: firstly, scientific literature rarely considers customer, environmental, and human-in-the-loop aspects when linking ML to PPC. Secondly, recent applications seldom couple PPC to logistics as well as to design of products and processes. Finally, two key pitfalls are identified in the implementation of ML-PPC models: the complexity of using Internet of Things technologies to collect data and the difficulty of updating the ML model to adapt it to the manufacturing system changes.

AB  - As a disruptive emerging technology, the Internet of things (IoT) has rapidly developed, but its privacy risks and security vulnerabilities are still key challenges. The decentralized and distributed architecture of blockchain has the potential to satisfy IoT privacy and security requirements. This gives birth to the new domain of blockchain for IoT (BIoT). BIoT will cause significant transformations across several industries, paving the way for new business models. Based on the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) databases in Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection, this study aims to explore the research trends and cooperation in the field of BIoT using the bibliometric method. The results indicate that the publications in this field have increased significantly from 2016 to 2020, with China and the USA being the most productive and influential countries. Keyword co-occurrence analysis shows that the most important research topics are as follows: security issues, core technologies, application dimensions, and transaction processes. Text mining analysis indicates that future research directions for BloT will focus more on both computing paradigms and key applications. This study will provide researchers with a greater understanding on the state of the art of BIoT and will serve as a reference for researchers engaging in this field to identify their own future research directions.

AB  - The goal of this paper is to provide a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications that employ text mining in management. To accomplish this, the authors collected 1282 documents from the Web of Science and performed performance analysis and science mapping with the help of the Bibliometrix package in Rstudio. The performance analysis used a range of bibliometric indicators such as productivity, citations, h-index, and m-quotient, in order to identify research trends and the most influential journals, authors, countries, and literature in the study. Science mapping used author keywords co-occurrence, co-authorship, and co-citation analysis to reflect the conceptual, social, and intellectual structure of the research. Specifically, we have seen an exponential increase in the use of text mining in management in recent years. The United States is the dominant country for research, having the earliest studies and the highest number of literature and citations. Furthermore, the research themes showed that topic modeling is at the forefront of current text mining research about management. This study will help scholars and management practitioners interested in the intersection of text mining and management to quickly understand the latest advances in research.

VL  - 6
AB  - As the world population is expected to touch 9.73 billion by 2050, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the demand for agricultural needs is increasing proportionately. Smart Agriculture is replacing conventional farming systems, employing advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) to ensure higher productivity and precise agriculture management to overcome food demand. In recent years, there has been an increased interest in researchers within Smart Agriculture. Previous literature reviews have also conducted similar bibliometric analyses; however, there is a lack of research in Operations Research (OR) insights into Smart Agriculture. This paper conducts a Bibliometric Analysis of past research work in OR knowledge which has been done over the last two decades in Agriculture 4.0, to understand the trends and the gaps. Biblioshiny, an advanced data mining tool, was used in conducting bibliometric analysis on a total number of 1,305 articles collected from the Scopus database between the years 2000–2022. Researchers and decision makers will be able to visualize how newer advanced OR theories are being applied and how they can contribute toward some research gaps highlighted in this review paper. While governments and policymakers will benefit through understanding how Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and robotic units are being used in farms to optimize resource allocation. Nations that have arid climate conditions would be informed how satellite imagery and mapping can assist them in detecting newer irrigation lands to assist their scarce agriculture resources.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the structure and dynamics of academic articles relating to public procurement (PP) in the period 1984–2022 (up to May). The researchers also intend to analyse how this knowledge domain has grown since 1984. Design/methodology/approach A bibliometric analysis was carried out to examine the existing state of PP research. Based on 640 journal articles indexed in the Scopus database and written by 1,247 authors over nearly four decades, a bibliometric analysis was conducted to reveal the intellectual structure of academic works pertaining to PP. Findings Findings reveal that PP research from Scopus has significantly increased in the past decade. Major journals publishing PP research are International Journal of Procurement Management , Journal of Cleaner Production , Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management and Public Money and Management . Results also indicate that authors’ cooperation network is fragmented, showing limited collaboration among PP researchers. In addition, results suggest that the institutional collaboration network in PP research mirrors what is commonly referred to as the North–South divide, signifying insufficient research collaboration between developed and developing countries’ institutions. According to the co-occurrence keyword network and topic modelling, PP revolves around five main themes, including innovation, corruption, sustainable and green PP, PP contracts and small and medium enterprises. Based on these results, several directions for future research are suggested. Social implications This paper provides an increased understanding of the entire PP field and the potential research directions. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first-ever application of bibliometric techniques and topic modelling to examine the development of PP research since 1984 based on scholarly publications extracted from the Scopus database.

AB  - Improving business processes provides companies with advantages in terms of efficiency and profitability, as well as competitiveness against other companies in the market. Companies that integrate business processes with enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems into digital platforms also have the opportunity to strengthen their weaknesses by recognizing disruptions and bottlenecks in inefficient business processes thanks to this digital transformation. Descriptive and bibliometric analyses were performed in this study for a systematic evaluation of studies on artificial intelligence (AI) in the ERP literature. The studies in which the keywords determined from the AI literature were firstly used together with ERP were investigated from the Scopus database. 837 publications meeting the search criteria were reached and a descriptive analysis of these publications was presented. Then, bibliometric analysis was performed using common author, common citation, and common keyword analysis methods for 296 publications in the article type. Tsinghua University and Obuda University have the most publications according to the results. The most commonly used AI keywords in the ERP studies were “genetic algorithm”, “fuzzy logic”, and “machine learning”. This study aims to guide future studies by providing a systematic and new perspective to researchers and experts working on ERP-AI.

AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease. Recently, growing evidence demonstrates that gut microbiota (GM) plays an important role in RA. But so far, no bibliometric studies pertaining to GM in RA have ever been published. This study attempts to depict the knowledge framework in this field from a holistic and systematic perspective based on the bibliometric analysis.Literature related to the involvement of GM in RA was searched and picked from the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) database. The annual output, cooperation, hotspots, research status and development trend of this field were analyzed by bibliometric software (VOSviewer and Bibliometricx).255 original research articles and 204 reviews were included in the analysis. The articles in this field that can be retrieved in WOSCC were first published in 2004 and increased year by year since then. 2013 is a growth explosion point. China and the United States are the countries with the most contributions, and Harvard University is the affiliation with the most output. Frontiers in Immunology (total citations = 603) is the journal with the most publications and the fastest growth rate. eLife is the journal with the most citations (total citations = 1248). Scher, Jose U. and Taneja, Veena are the most productive and cited authors. The research in this field is mainly distributed in the evidence, mechanism and practical application of GM participating in RA through the analysis of keywords and documents. There is sufficient evidence to prove the close relationship between GM and RA, which lays the foundation for this field. This extended two colorful and tender branches of mechanism research and application exploration, which have made some achievements but still have broad exploration space. Recently, the keywords "metabolites", "metabolomics", "acid", "b cells", "balance", "treg cells", "probiotic supplementation" appeared most frequently, which tells us that research on the mechanism of GM participating in RA and exploration of its application are the hotspots in recent years.Taken together, these results provide a data-based and objective introduction to the GM participating in RA, giving readers a valuable reference to help guide future research.

AB  - To improve the finish and efficiency of machining processes, researchers set out to develop techniques to detect, suppress, or avoid vibration chatter. This work involves tracing chatter detection techniques, from time–frequency signal processing methods (FFT, HHT, STFT, etc.), decomposition (WPD, EMD, VMD, etc.) to the combination with machine learning or deep learning models. A cartographic analysis was carried out to discover the limits of these different techniques and to propose possible solutions in perspective to detect chattering in the machining processes. The fact that human expert detects chatter using simple spectrograms is confronted with the variety of signal processing methods used in the literature and lead to possible optimal detecting techniques. For this purpose, the bibliometric tool R-Tool was used to facilitate a bibliometric analysis using specific means for quantitative bibliometric research and visualization. Data were collected from the Web of Science (WoS 2022) using particular queries on chatter detection. Most documents collected detect chatter with either transformation or decomposition techniques.

AB  - This article questions the effects on urban research dynamics of the Big Data and AI turn in urban management. Increasing access to large datasets collected in real time could make certain mathematical models developed in research fields related to the management of urban systems obsolete. These ongoing evolutions are the subject of numerous works whose main angle of reflection is the future of cities rather than the transformations at work in the academic field. Our article proposes grasp the scientific dynamics in areas of research related to two urban systems: transportation and water. The article demonstrates the importance of grasping these dynamics if we want to be able to apprehend what the urban management of tomorrow's cities will be like. To analyse these research areas’ dynamics, we use two complementary materials: bibliometric data and interviews. The interviews conducted in 2018 with academics and higher education officials in Paris and Edinburgh suggest avenues for hybridization between traditional modelling approaches and research in machine learning, artificial intelligence and Big Data. The bibliometric analysis highlight the trends at work: it shows that traffic flow as well as transportation studies are focussing more and more on AI and Big Data and that traffic flow studies are arousing a growing interest among computer scientists, while, so far, this interest is less pronounced in the water research area, and more especially regarding water quality. The differences observed between research on transportation and that on water confirm the multifaceted nature of the developments at work and encourage us to reject overly hasty and simplistic generalisations about the transformations underway.

AB  - Additive manufacturing (AM) is poised to bring a revolution due to its unique production paradigm. It offers the prospect of mass customization, flexible production, on-demand and decentralized manufacturing. However, a number of challenges stem from not only the complexity of manufacturing systems but the demand for increasingly complex and high-quality products, in terms of design principles, standardization and quality control. These challenges build up barriers to the widespread adoption of AM in the industry and the in-depth research of AM in academia. To tackle the challenges, machine learning (ML) technologies rise to play a critical role as they are able to provide effective ways to quality control, process optimization, modelling of complex systems, and energy management. Hence, this paper employs a systematic literature review method as it is a defined and methodical way of identifying, assessing, and analysing published literature. Then, a keyword co-occurrence and cluster analysis are employed for analysing relevant literature. Several aspects of AM, including Design for AM (DfAM), material analytics, in situ monitoring and defect detection, property prediction and sustainability, have been clustered and summarized to present state-of-the-art research in the scope of ML for AM. Finally, the challenges and opportunities of ML for AM are uncovered and discussed.

AB  - Today's digital world is characterized by advances in communication and information technologies. Internet technology provides a variety of communication channels like social media platforms, social network sites, search engines, blogs, forums, websites and e-mails. The users of these channels create digital traces which are the main source of big data in communication studies in social sciences. Big social data analytics in communication studies provides quantitative indicators to fully understand current situations rather than predefined cause and effect relationships. This study aims to investigate the studies in "big data and communication" in social sciences between the years 2014 and 2018. Web of Science Social Science Citation Index journals are selected to present systematic and quantitative analysis of the research field. Bibliometric analysis results provide insights about big data usage and expansion in the communication field not previously grasped by other reviews on this special topic. Bibliometric tools helped to identify research clusters, key research topics, and network and collaboration patterns in big data and communication studies in a social sciences context. This bibliometric mapping of the field visually illustrates the evolution of studies over time and identifies current research interests and future directions for the followers.&nbsp;

AB  - To grasp the current status of network public opinion (NPO) research and explore the knowledge base and hot trends from a quantitative perspective, we retrieved 1385 related papers and conducted a bibliometric mapping analysis on them. Co-occurrence analysis, cluster analysis, co-citation analysis and keyword burst analysis were performed using VOSviewer and CiteSpace software. The results show that the NPO is mainly distributed in the disciplinary fields associated with journalism and communication and public management. There are four main hotspots: analysis of public opinion, analysis of communication channels, technical means and challenges faced. The knowledge base in the field of NPO research includes social media, user influence, and user influence related to opinion dynamic modeling and sentiment analysis. With the advent of the era of big data, big data technology has been widely used in various fields and to some extent can be said to be the research frontier in the field. Transforming big data public opinion into early warning, realizing in-depth analysis and accurate prediction of public opinion as well as improving decision-making ability of public opinion are the future research directions of NPO.

AB  - Purpose The emergence of machine learning has opened a new way for researchers. It allows them to supplement the traditional manual methods for conducting a literature review and turning it into smart literature. This study aims to present a framework for incorporating machine learning into financial statement fraud (FSF) literature analysis. This framework facilitates the analysis of a large amount of literature to show the trend of the field and identify the most productive authors, journals and potential areas for future research. Design/methodology/approach In this study, a framework was introduced that merges bibliometric analysis techniques such as word frequency, co-word analysis and coauthorship analysis with the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling approach. This framework was used to uncover subtopics from 20 years of financial fraud research articles. Furthermore, the hierarchical clustering method was used on selected subtopics to demonstrate the primary contexts in the literature on FSF. Findings This study has contributed to the literature in two ways. First, this study has determined the top journals, articles, countries and keywords based on various bibliometric metrics. Second, using topic modeling and then hierarchy clustering, this study demonstrates the four primary contexts in FSF detection. Research limitations/implications In this study, the authors tried to comprehensively view the studies related to financial fraud conducted over two decades. However, this research has limitations that can be an opportunity for future researchers. The first limitation is due to language bias. This study has focused on English language articles, so it is suggested that other researchers consider other languages as well. The second limitation is caused by citation bias. In this study, the authors tried to show the top articles based on the citation criteria. However, judging based on citation alone can be misleading. Therefore, this study suggests that the researchers consider other measures to check the citation quality and assess the studies’ precision by applying meta-analysis. Originality/value Despite the popularity of bibliometric analysis and topic modeling, there have been limited efforts to use machine learning for literature review. This novel approach of using hierarchical clustering on topic modeling results enable us to uncover four primary contexts. Furthermore, this method allowed us to show the keywords of each context and highlight significant articles within each context.

AB  - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has emerged as an important algorithm in big data analysis that finds the group of topics in the text data. It posits that each text document consists of a group of topics, and each topic is a mixture of words related to it. With the emergence of a plethora of text data, the LDA has become a popular algorithm for topic modeling among researchers from different domains. Therefore, it is essential to understand the trends of LDA researches. Bibliometric techniques are established methods to study the research progress of a topic. In this study, bibliographic data of 18715 publications that have cited the LDA were extracted from the Scopus database. The software R and Vosviewer were used to carry out the analysis. The analysis revealed that research interest in LDA had grown exponentially. The results showed that most authors preferred “Book Series” followed by “Conference Proceedings” as the publication venue. The majority of the institutions and authors were from the USA, followed by China. The co-occurrence analysis of keywords indicated that text mining and machine learning were dominant topics in LDA research with significant interest in social media. This study attempts to provide a comprehensive analysis and intellectual structure of LDA compared to previous studies.

AB  - Given the severe difficulties and challenges being faced during the current COVID-19 pandemic, agribusinesses must consider alternative means to market and sell agriproducts using e-commerce and advanced technologies. Agricultural e-commerce that utilizes advanced technologies can promote sustainable economic growth and gender equality and, therefore, helps achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. It also allows farmers access to new markets where they can bypass intermediaries, leading to higher income, less waste, and fresher produce for customers. The usefulness of using agricultural e-commerce depends on the efficiency of addressing the emerging challenges from merging perspectives of agricultural and e-commerce fields. Literature reviews addressed both fields from different perspectives, however, most literature addresses the agriculture and e-commerce fields separately, leading to unclarity in understanding the differences between agriproducts and other products. This study aims to present a comprehensive and robust roadmap of technological advancements and challenges in agricultural e-commerce through a thorough bibliometric and content analysis and provide a conceptual architecture for best practices. The bibliometric and content analysis sheds light on the agricultural e-commerce categories, challenges, and limitations. This study identifies the most influential research and topic trends, determines the topical discipline areas, and provides visions and directions for future research in the field of agricultural e-commerce. It discusses the challenges of agricultural e-commerce and agriproducts and how advanced technologies help solve such challenges. This study summarises the best practice implementation of agricultural e-commerce by providing strong logistics, implementing standardization, including information knowledge of agriproducts, and creating a traceability information system. The result of this paper is presented as a proposed conceptual architecture for agricultural e-commerce that addresses the abovementioned best practice concepts and utilizes the Blockchain and IoT technologies to provide innovative solutions for the agricultural e-commerce stakeholders. Finally, this study provides prospects for future research on advanced technologies in agricultural e-commerce.

AB  - Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) with their immaculate sensing and navigating capabilities are expected to revolutionize urban mobility. Despite the expected benefits, this emerging technology has certain implications pertaining to their deployment in mixed traffic streams, owing to different driving logics than Human-driven Vehicles (HVs). Many researchers have been working to devise a sustainable urban transport system by considering the operational and safety aspects of mixed traffic during the transition phase. However, limited scholarly attention has been devoted to mapping an overview of this research area. This paper attempts to map the state of the art of scientific production about autonomous vehicles in mixed traffic conditions, using a bibliometric analysis of 374 documents extracted from the Scopus database from 1999 to 2021. The VOSviewer 1.1.18 and Biblioshiny 3.1 software were used to demonstrate the progress status of the publications concerned. The analysis revealed that the number of publications has continuously increased during the last five years. The text analysis showed that the author keywords “autonomous vehicles” and “mixed traffic” dominated the other author keywords because of their frequent occurrence. From thematic analysis, three research stages associated with AVs were identified; pre-development (1999–2017), development (2017–2020) and deployment (2021). The study highlighted the potential research areas, such as involvement of autonomous vehicles in transportation planning, interaction between autonomous vehicles and human driven vehicles, traffic and energy efficiencies associated with automated driving, penetration rates for autonomous vehicles in mixed traffic scenarios, and safe and efficient operation of autonomous vehicles in mixed traffic environment. Additionally, discussion on the three key aspects was conducted, including the impacts of AVs, their driving characteristics and strategies for their successful deployment in context of mixed traffic. This paper provides ample future directions to the people willing to work in this area of autonomous vehicles in mixed traffic conditions. The study also revealed current trends as well as potential future hotspots in the area of autonomous vehicles in mixed traffic.

AB  - Analysing historical patterns of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption can inform decisions about AI capability uplift, but research to date has provided a limited view of AI adoption across various fields of research. In this study we examine worldwide adoption of AI technology within 333 fields of research during 1960-2021. We do this by using bibliometric analysis with 137 million peer-reviewed publications captured in The Lens database. We define AI using a list of 214 phrases developed by expert working groups at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). We found that 3.1 million of the 137 million peer-reviewed research publications during the entire period were AI-related, with a surge in AI adoption across practically all research fields (physical science, natural science, life science, social science and the arts and humanities) in recent years. The diffusion of AI beyond computer science was early, rapid and widespread. In 1960 14% of 333 research fields were related to AI (many in computer science), but this increased to cover over half of all research fields by 1972, over 80% by 1986 and over 98% in current times. We note AI has experienced boom-bust cycles historically: the AI "springs" and "winters". We conclude that the context of the current surge appears different, and that interdisciplinary AI application is likely to be sustained.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) can improve the health and well-being of older adults and has the potential to assist and improve nursing care. In recent years, research in this area has been increasing. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the status of development and main research hotspots and identify the main contributors and their relationships in the application of AI in geriatric care via bibliometric analysis.Using bibliometric analysis, this study aims to examine the current research hotspots and collaborative networks in the application of AI in geriatric care over the past 23 years.The Web of Science Core Collection database was used as a source. All publications from inception to August 2022 were downloaded. The external characteristics of the publications were summarized through HistCite and the Web of Science. Keywords and collaborative networks were analyzed using VOSviewers and Citespace.We obtained a total of 230 publications. The works originated in 499 institutions in 39 countries, were published in 124 journals, and were written by 1216 authors. Publications increased sharply from 2014 to 2022, accounting for 90.87% (209/230) of all publications. The United States and the International Journal of Social Robotics had the highest number of publications on this topic. The 1216 authors were divided into 5 main clusters. Among the 230 publications, 4 clusters were modeled, including Alzheimer disease, aged care, acceptance, and the surveillance and treatment of diseases. Machine learning, deep learning, and rehabilitation had also become recent research hotspots.Research on the application of AI in geriatric care has developed rapidly. The development of research and cooperation among countries/regions and institutions are limited. In the future, strengthening the cooperation and communication between different countries/regions and institutions may further drive this field's development. This study provides researchers with the information necessary to understand the current state, collaborative networks, and main research hotspots of the field. In addition, our results suggest a series of recommendations for future research.

AB  - Multispectral technology has a wide range of applications in agriculture. By obtaining spectral information during crop production, key information such as growth, pests and diseases, fertilizer and pesticide application can be determined quickly, accurately and efficiently. The scientific analysis based on Web of Science aims to understand the research hotspots and areas of interest in the field of agricultural multispectral technology. The publications related to agricultural multispectral research in agriculture between 2002 and 2021 were selected as the research objects. The softwares of CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and Microsoft Excel were used to provide a comprehensive review of agricultural multispectral research in terms of research areas, institutions, influential journals, and core authors. Results of the analysis show that the number of publications increased each year, with the largest increase in 2019. Remote sensing, imaging technology, environmental science, and ecology are the most popular research directions. The journal Remote Sensing is one of the most popular publishers, showing a high publishing potential in multispectral research in agriculture. The institution with the most research literature and citations is the USDA. In terms of the number of papers, Mtanga is the author with the most published articles in recent years. Through keyword co-citation analysis, it is determined that the main research areas of this topic focus on remote sensing, crop classification, plant phenotypes and other research areas. The literature co-citation analysis indicates that the main research directions concentrate in vegetation index, satellite remote sensing applications and machine learning modeling. There is still a lot of room for development of multi-spectrum technology. Further development can be carried out in the areas of multi-device synergy, spectral fusion, airborne equipment improvement, and real-time image processing technology, which will cooperate with each other to further play the role of multi-spectrum in agriculture and promote the development of agriculture.

AB  - Risk assessment is of great significance in industrial production and sustainable development. Great potential is attributed to machine learning in industrial risk assessment as a promising technology in the fields of computer science and the internet. To better understand the role of machine learning in this field and to investigate the current research status, we selected 3116 papers from the SCIE and SSCI databases of the WOS retrieval platform between 1991 and 2022 as our data sample. The VOSviewer, Bibliometrix R, and CiteSpace software were used to perform co-occurrence analysis, clustering analysis, and dual-map overlay analysis of keywords. The results indicate that the development trend of machine learning in industrial risk assessment can be divided into three stages: initial exploration, stable development, and high-speed development. Machine learning algorithm design, applications in biomedicine, risk monitoring in construction and machinery, and environmental protection are the knowledge base of this study. There are three research hotspots in the application of machine learning to industrial risk assessment: the study of machine learning algorithms, the risk assessment of machine learning in the Industry 4.0 system, and the application of machine learning in autonomous driving. At present, the basic theories and structural systems related to this research have been established, and there are numerous research directions and extensive frontier branches. “Random Forest”, “Industry 4.0”, “supply chain risk assessment”, and “Internet of Things” are at the forefront of the research.

AB  - Information and communication technologies play a critical role in tourism, providing benefits such as improvement in tourism experiences, co-creation of value, and promotion of the marketing of relationships and phygital experiences, where online and offline environments are combined. In recent years, tourism planning and management through smart destinations has aroused great academic interest by including the dimensions of governance, sustainability, accessibility, innovation, and technology. This work aims to analyse and to visualize the scientific production associated with technology in the context of smart destinations. For this, evaluative and relational bibliometric analysis techniques were applied to the bibliographic data of 395 articles indexed in Scopus and Web of Science up to September 2021. The results indicate that there is considerable growth and that a number of authors, countries, and leading institutions contribute significantly to scientific knowledge. In addition, using two bibliometric software tools, VOSviewer and SciMAT, a co-citation network of authors was built to describe their intellectual structure, and a keyword co-occurrence analysis was performed to identify the main thematic areas. The motor themes that drive the research are the conceptualization of tourist destinations, innovation, and data, while experience is a crosscutting theme. Additionally, some limitations and applications of the research are discussed, as well as the practical implications for destination management.

AB  - Reliable cybersecurity has a decision value for economic and national security of every country. The financial sector is most susceptible to cyber-attacks, as it is one of the most important systems of society, containing a large amount of data and critical information. To provide reliable cybersecurity, government must participate actively in development and strengthening of policies. It includes establishment of rules and standards for business, creation of only national strategy of cybersecurity and participating in international partnership for an exchange advanced experience and resources. In addition, government must invest in cybersecurity tools, technology, and personnel to protect digital infrastructure and the data of citizens and companies. Finally, governments should prioritize cyber security education and awareness among citizens and companies to minimize the risk of digital attacks. The article provides a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of scientific publications devoted to the topic of financial cyber security using modern powerful bibliometric software (Vosviewer, Bibliometrix, SciVal) and an analysis of normative legislative documents of Ukraine and the European Union, in particular the recommendations of the European Union Agency for Cyber Security (ENISA). The bibliometric analysis made it possible to form groups of clusters characterizing the cyber lexicon, methods, and technologies for detecting cyberthreats, and to highlight the most cited publications in the world. The statistical basis for the analysis was formed by scientific publications indexed by the Elsevier reference and bibliographic corporation. The results of the conducted research are a plan of recommended actions for managers of financial institutions, banks, and enterprises regarding the effective organization of cyber security and includes such steps as: development of cyber security culture on an ongoing basis; appointment of a responsible person for the organization of cyber security; conducting cyber security audits on an ongoing basis; creating a data protection memo; provision of advanced training in the field of cyber data protection; ensuring effective interaction with a third party involved in financial relations, reflected in concluded contracts; formation of a response plan to cyber incidents; organization of secure access to automated information systems used in the institution’s operations; organization of device security in case of remote use and performance of professional duties; organization of network connection security; improvement of physical security of official documents and devices; protection of backup copies and testing for the possibility of a full update based on these backup copies; synchronization with cloud technologies in compliance with the provisions of regulatory documents; protection of websites, publication and distribution of up-to-date information on new types and types of cyber threats.

AB  - COVID-19 has emerged as a widely researched topic and the academia has taken interest in the effects of COVID-19 in various sectors of human life and society. Most of the bibliometric research addresses scientific contributions in medicine, health, and virology related topics, with very little emphasis on social sciences. Therefore, to address this gap, a bibliometric analysis of research related to COVID-19 in the subject area of social sciences was performed on selected publications from January 2020 to mid-2021. A total of 9289 articles were analysed to identify major emerging themes of Covid-19 and social sciences and how research collaborations between countries have helped in communicating critical issues to academia. The empirical results indicate the dominance of psychology and business economics subjects in the social sciences sphere, with the emerging themes as psychosocial problems among people, economics, the outbreak of SARS, and discussions on the quality of life in terms of surroundings and environment. The study also suggests that more collaborations between social scientists working in different nations is required to explore the less focussed themes addressing the local challenges of poor nations.

AB  - The integration of wind energy into power systems has intensified as a result of the urgency for global energy transition. This requires more accurate forecasting techniques that can capture the variability of the wind resource to achieve better operative performance of power systems. This paper presents an exhaustive review of the state-of-the-art of wind-speed and -power forecasting models for wind turbines located in different segments of power systems, i.e., in large wind farms, distributed generation, microgrids, and micro-wind turbines installed in residences and buildings. This review covers forecasting models based on statistical and physical, artificial intelligence, and hybrid methods, with deterministic or probabilistic approaches. The literature review is carried out through a bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer and Pajek software. A discussion of the results is carried out, taking as the main approach the forecast time horizon of the models to identify their applications. The trends indicate a predominance of hybrid forecast models for the analysis of power systems, especially for those with high penetration of wind power. Finally, it is determined that most of the papers analyzed belong to the very short-term horizon, which indicates that the interest of researchers is in this time horizon.

AB  - The aim of this study is to consolidate the state of mobile commerce consumer research from 2001 to 2022. Based on a systematic literature review employing a bibliometric technique, this study not only reports the significant contributions of authors and their affiliations but also discusses the evolution of m-commerce research over the last two decades. Examination of annual production trends revealed that publications were on the rise all along; the year 2022 clocked the highest number of publications (53 documents), which further reinforces that the research on this domain is in its blooming season. China is the most contributing country in terms of the number of publications and citations received, followed by the USA. The author Keng-Boon Ooi has been the most productive researcher; his studies continue to be the foundation on which m-commerce consumer research continues to thrive. The analysis of scientific mapping revealed that, although many studies were carried out on mobile commerce adoption intention, the focus of the researchers lately shifted towards studying continuous use intention (since 2018). Further, it was observed that the base theory, the Technology Acceptance Model, which has been widely used for determining antecedents of technology adoption intention, is losing its significance and is being overtly replaced by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. While the topics “trust, loyalty, satisfaction, mobile banking, UTAUT, continuance intention, perceived enjoyment, and COVID-19” were identified as mother (engine) themes, the keywords “privacy, self-efficacy, social influence, TAM, attitude, and intention to use” became diminishing themes. The following topics have been identified as emerging themes: “Mobile social commerce, Mobile payment, Mobile marketing, Omnichannel, Fintech, and Live streaming commerce”. This study provides useful insights to potential researchers.

AB  - We propose a new framework for research synthesis of both evidence and influence, named research weaving. It summarizes and visualizes information content, history, and networks among a collection of documents on any given topic. Research weaving achieves this feat by combining the power of two methods: systematic mapping and bibliometrics. Systematic mapping provides a snapshot of the current state of knowledge, identifying areas needing more research attention and those ready for full synthesis. Bibliometrics enables researchers to see how pieces of evidence are connected, revealing the structure and development of a field. We explain how researchers can use some or all of these tools to gain a deeper, more nuanced understanding of the scientific literature.

AB  - It gets harder and harder to guarantee the quality of software systems due to their increasing complexity and fast development. Because it helps spot errors and gaps during the first phases of software development, software testing is one of the most crucial stages of software engineering. Software testing used to be done manually, which is a time-consuming, imprecise procedure that comes with errors and gaps and costs money, time, and effort. Currently, testing professionals routinely automate testing to obtain trustworthy results while saving time, cost, and labor. We’ve also moved the starting point of the software cycle to the developer, and made write tests before even writing code, or what’s known as TDD (Test Driven Development). The use of new artificial intelligence techniques will enable the generation of smart test cases to improve test quality and provide better coverage and accurate results. In this study, we used the Web of Science database to acquire bibliometric data about intelligent software testing papers which were conducted between 2012 and 2022, and we used Biblioshiny from the R bibliomerix package, alongside with VOSViewer in order to analyze the data and extract insights and answer research questions about the authors, articles, journals, organizations, and countries publishing in the field of intelligent software testing. The focus of this study is on scientific progress and collaborative trends in scholarly research, providing a blueprint for showcasing worldwide developments in the realm of intelligent software testing. By gaining a comprehensive understanding of the present state of research on the application of artificial intelligence in software testing, this study can offer valuable insights to software engineers, architects, and researchers in the field.

AB  - The vehicle routing problem (VRP), as a classic combinatorial optimization problem, has always been a hot research topic in operations research. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the VRP problem, this work uses the knowledge graph to comprehensively analyze and summarize the literature related to VRP from 1959 to 2022 in the Web of Science (WoS) database. Firstly, according to the basic statistical information of the literature, the annual publications, the authors, their institutions and countries, the keyword co-occurrence, and the literature co-citation network are analyzed to comprehensively summarize and generalize the research on VRP and predict its future development trend. The results show that, in the past 60 years, there have been abundant changes in the research on VRP. The United States and China have made the most important contributions in the field of VRP. According to the WoS literature retrieval results and classification methods, the VRP models and their solutions are comprehensively classified, and the model solving algorithms are divided into exact algorithms, heuristic algorithms, metaheuristic algorithms, hyper-heuristic algorithms, machine learning, etc. The results show that the development of information computing technology plays an important role in research on the VRP problem, and dynamic VRP, hyper-heuristic algorithms, deep reinforcement learning, etc. are the future development directions of the VRP model and its optimization.

AB  - The impact of hate speech, both on a personal and social level, has increased due to social media. This has made it the focus of interest of numerous scientific journals, which increases the visibility of this global problem. The aim of this research is to analyse the basic descriptive metrics of the scientific production on hate speech and social media, as well as to explore the interdisciplinarity of these approaches. A bibliometric study has been carried out on the basis of the works indexed in the Scopus database related to the binomial ‘hate speech’ and ‘social media’ over a period of 20 years (2001 to 2020). The metrics used show that it is from 2017 onwards when this topic begins to arouse greater interest among researchers and that they constitute a sufficient indicator to consider the topic as one of interest to the scientific community. The joint research between both concepts raises its quality levels from a strictly metric point of view. ‘Computer Science’ and ‘Social Sciences’ are the two areas that clearly define the scientific production on this subject. The inversion of percentages in terms of the areas of origin of the works and citations in these two areas, is evidence of this interdisciplinarity. The indicators obtained show the relevance and transcendence of a social problem in the face of which proactive measures must be implemented. Las repercusiones que tiene el discurso del odio, tanto a nivel personal como social, se han intensificado con las redes sociales. Esto lo ha convertido en centro de interés de numerosas revistas científicas, lo que incrementa la visibilización de esta problemática global. El objetivo de esta investigación es analizar las métricas básicas descriptivas de la producción científica sobre el discurso del odio y redes sociales, así como explorar la interdisciplinariedad de estos enfoques. Se ha llevado a cabo un estudio bibliométrico a partir de trabajos indexados en la base de datos Scopus relacionados con el binomio «discurso de odio» y «redes sociales», en un período temporal de 20 años (2001 a 2020). Las métricas utilizadas demuestran que, a partir del año 2017, esta temática comienza a despertar mayor interés entre los investigadores, constituyéndose un indicador suficiente para considerar el tema como de interés por parte de la comunidad científica. La investigación conjunta entre ambos conceptos eleva sus niveles de calidad desde un punto de vista estrictamente métrico. Las áreas «Computer Science» y «Social Sciences» son las dos que definen claramente la producción científica sobre este tema. La inversión de porcentajes en cuanto a áreas de procedencia de los trabajos y citas en estas dos áreas evidencian esta interdisciplinariedad. Los indicadores obtenidos muestran la relevancia y trascendencia de un problema social ante el que se deben implementar medidas proactivas.

Among these, the integration of technology into health and safety leads to enhanced safety performance. Considering the benefits observed in using technology in safety, this study aims to explore digital technologies' use and potential benefits in construction health and safety. Design/methodology/approach An extensive bibliometrics analysis was conducted to reveal which technologies are at the forefront of others and how these technologies are used in safety operations. The study used two different databases, Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus, to scan the literature in a systemic way. Findings The systemic analysis of several studies showed that the digital technologies use in construction are still a niche theme and need more assessment. The study provided that sensors and wireless technology are of utmost importance in terms of construction safety. Moreover, the study revealed that artificial intelligence, machine learning, building information modeling (BIM), sensors and wireless technologies are trending technologies compared to unmanned aerial vehicles, serious games and the Internet of things. On the other hand, the study provided that the technologies are even more effective with integrated use like in the case of BIM and sensors or unmanned aerial vehicles. It was observed that the use of these technologies varies with respect to studies conducted in different countries. The study further revealed that the studies conducted on this topic are mostly published in some selected journals and international collaboration efforts in terms of researching the topic have been observed. Originality/value This study provides an extensive analysis of WoS and Scopus databases and an in-depth review of the use of digital technologies in construction safety. The review consists of the most recent studies showing the benefits of using such technologies and showing the usage on a systemic level from which both scientists and practitioners can benefit to devise new strategies in technology usage.

AB  - Abstract Uncovering the driving forces, strategic landscapes, and evolutionary mechanisms of China’s research systems is attracting rising interest around the globe. One topic of interest is to understand the problem-solving patterns in China’s research systems now and in the future. Targeting a set of high-quality research articles published by Chinese researchers between 2009 and 2018, and indexed in the Essential Science Indicators database, we developed an intelligent bibliometrics-based methodology for identifying the problem-solving patterns from scientific documents. Specifically, science overlay maps incorporating link prediction were used to profile China’s disciplinary interactions and predict potential cross-disciplinary innovation at a macro level. We proposed a function incorporating word embedding techniques to represent subjects, actions, and objects (SAO) retrieved from combined titles and abstracts into vectors and constructed a tri-layer SAO network to visualize SAOs and their semantic relationships. Then, at a micro level, we developed network analytics for identifying problems and solutions from the SAO network, and recommending potential solutions for existing problems. Empirical insights derived from this study provide clues to understand China’s research strengths and the science policies underlying them, along with the key research problems and solutions that Chinese researchers are focusing on now and might pursue in the future.

AB  - Background/objectives: Brazil, Russia, India China and South Africa have prioritized cooperation regarding health, including malnutrition. Anaemia in children, adolescents and women of reproductive age has been on the increase in these countries, placing a huge strain on healthcare systems. This study aimed to map the scientific perspective and research publications on anaemia in children and adolescents in the BRICS countries. Methods: Bibliometric analyses were employed to map scientific publications related to anaemia in children and adolescents in BRICS countries using VOSviewer software. Research documents from 1990 to 2020 were imported from PubMed. Descriptive statistics was used to analyse trends in research publications, authorship and keywords over the 30-year period. Findings: BRICS countries accounted for 15% of all publications on the subject within the last three decades. While India had the highest number of publications, China had the author with the highest number of research publications and co-authorship links. Of all article types, India had the highest number of letters, while China and South Africa published the highest number of RCT/clinical trial and review articles, respectively. Conclusion: The review of all scientific studies on anaemia in BRICS nations for the past 30 years revealed gaps in research collaborations on anaemia between authors in BRICS nations. However, collaborative research projects may contribute to building a shared base of evidence, innovations, data and methodologies for a more comprehensive understanding of the risks and vulnerabilities of child and adolescent anaemia. This will aid in the development and evaluation of interventions and policies to alleviate anaemia and nutrient deficiencies.

AB  - Abstract Understanding the role of prior knowledge in human learning is essential for predicting, improving, and explaining competence acquisition. However, the size and breadth of this field make it difficult for researchers to glean a comprehensive overview. Hence, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of 13,507 relevant studies published between 1980 and 2021. Abstracts, titles, and metadata were analyzed using text mining and network analysis. The studies investigated 23 topics forming five communities: Education, Learning Environments, Cognitive Processes, Nonacademic Settings, and Language. The investigated knowledge was diverse regarding its types, characteristics, and representations, covering more than 25 academic and non-academic content domains. The most frequently referenced theoretical backgrounds were the 3P Model, Cognitive Load Theory, and Conceptual Change approaches. While our results indicate that prior knowledge is a widely used cross-sectional research topic, there remains a need for more integrative theories of when and how prior knowledge causally affects learning.

AB  - The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been profound, placing significant challenges upon healthcare systems and the world economy. The pervasive presence of illness, uncertainty, and fear has markedly diminished overall life satisfaction. Consequently, sentiment analysis has gained substantial traction among scholars seeking to unravel the emotional and attitudinal dimensions of this crisis. This research endeavors to provide a bibliometric perspective, shedding light on the principal contributors to this emerging field. It seeks to spotlight the academic institutions associated with this research domain, along with identifying the most influential publications in terms of both paper volume and h-index metrics. To this end, we have meticulously curated a dataset comprising 646 papers sourced from the ISI Web of Science database, all centering on the theme of sentiment analysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings underscore a burgeoning interest exhibited by the academic community in this particular domain, evident in an astonishing annual growth rate of 153.49%. Furthermore, our analysis elucidates key keywords and collaborative networks within the authorship, offering valuable insights into the global proliferation of this thematic pursuit. In addition to this, our analysis encompasses an n-gram investigation across keywords, abstracts, titles, and keyword plus, complemented by an examination of the most frequently cited works. The results gleaned from these endeavors offer crucial perspectives, contribute to the identification of pertinent issues, and provide guidance for informed decision-making.

AB  - In recent decades, health literacy has garnered increasing attention alongside a variety of public health topics. This study aims to explore trends in this area through a bibliometric analysis. A Random Forest Model was utilized to identify keywords and other metadata that predict average citations in the field. To supplement this machine learning analysis, we have also implemented a bibliometric review of the corpus. Our findings reveal significant positive coefficients for the keywords "COVID-19" and "Male", underscoring the influence of the pandemic and potential gender-related factors in the literature. On the other hand, the keyword "Female" showed a negative coefficient, hinting at possible disparities that warrant further investigation. Additionally, evolving themes such as COVID-19, mental health, and social media were discovered. A significant change was observed in the main publishing journals, while the major contributing authors remained the same. The results hint at the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and a significant association between gender-related keywords on citation likelihood, as well as changing publication strategies, despite the fact that the main researchers remain those who have been studying health literacy since its creation.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to introduce new tools to develop a more precise and focused bibliometric analysis on the field of digitalization in healthcare management. Furthermore, this study aims to provide an overview of the existing resources in healthcare management and education and other developing interdisciplinary fields. Design/methodology/approach This work uses bibliometric analysis to conduct a comprehensive review to map the use of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) research models in healthcare academic studies. Bibliometric studies are considered an important tool to evaluate research studies and to gain a comprehensive view of the state of the art. Findings Although UTAUT dates to 2003, our bibliometric analysis reveals that only since 2016 has the model, together with UTAUT2 (2012), had relevant application in the literature. Nonetheless, studies have shown that UTAUT and UTAUT2 are particularly suitable for understanding the reasons that underlie the adoption and non-adoption choices of eHealth services. Further, this study highlights the lack of a multidisciplinary approach in the implementation of eHealth services. Equally significant is the fact that many studies have focused on the acceptance and the adoption of eHealth services by end users, whereas very few have focused on the level of acceptance of healthcare professionals. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to conduct a bibliometric analysis of technology acceptance and adoption by using advanced tools that were conceived specifically for this purpose. In addition, the examination was not limited to a certain era and aimed to give a worldwide overview of eHealth service acceptance and adoption.

AB  - In-text citation analysis is one of the most frequently used methods in research evaluation. We are seeing significant growth in citation analysis through bibliometric metadata, primarily due to the availability of citation databases such as the Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, and Dimensions. Due to better access to full-text publication corpora in recent years, information scientists have gone far beyond traditional bibliometrics by tapping into advancements in full-text data processing techniques to measure the impact of scientific publications in contextual terms. This has led to technical developments in citation classifications, citation sentiment analysis, citation summarisation, and citation-based recommendation. This article aims to narratively review the studies on these developments. Its primary focus is on publications that have used natural language processing and machine learning techniques to analyse citations.

AB  - The constant technological transformations that have emerged over the last few decades have forced a fast adjustment caused both by the digitalization and automation processes that have revolutionized the job market. Even though the fourth industrial revolution allows the emergence of numerous job opportunities, it brings different restrictions that directly affect the daily lives of professionals and organizations. On the other hand, this implementation requires not only a large financial investment but also, and perhaps the most critical obstacle in this process, the training of human resources to be able to assimilate the complexity of these digital transformations. Thus, the main objective of this research is to try to understand which skills will be most required by the labor market in the future. To achieve this primary objective, a bibliometric study was carried out, based on the World Economic Forum report and two main databases: Web of Science and Scopus.

The method is applied to the research area Big Data for the time period 2012 to 2022, using the Scopus database. It turns out that the 10 most important research directions in Big Data are Machine learning, Deep learning and neural networks, Internet of things, Data mining, Cloud computing, Artificial intelligence, Healthcare, Security and privacy, Review, and Manufacturing. The role of Big Data research in different fields of science and technology is also analysed. For four geographic regions (North America, European Union, China, and The Rest of the World) different activity levels in Big Data during different parts of the time period are analysed. North America was the most active region during the first part of the time period. During the last years China is the most active region. The citation scores for documents from different regions and from different research directions within Big Data are also compared. North America has the highest average citation score among the geographic regions and the research direction Review has the highest average citation score among the research directions. The program and methodology for bibliometric mining developed in this study can be used also for other large research areas. Now that the program and methodology have been developed, it is expected that one could perform a similar study in some other research area in a couple of days.

AB  - Transportation is the backbone of the economy and urban development. Improving the efficiency, sustainability, resilience, and intelligence of transportation systems is critical and also challenging. The constantly changing traffic conditions, the uncertain influence of external factors (e.g. weather, accidents), and the interactions among multiple travel modes and multi-type flows result in the dynamic and stochastic natures of transportation systems. The planning, operation, and control of transportation systems require flexible and adaptable strategies in order to deal with uncertainty, non-linearity, variability, and high complexity. In this context, Reinforcement Learning (RL) that enables autonomous decision-makers to interact with the complex environment, learn from the experiences, and select optimal actions has been rapidly emerging as one of the most useful approaches for smart transportation applications. This paper conducts a bibliometric analysis to identify the development of RL-based methods for transportation applications, representative journals/conferences, and leading topics in recent 10 years. Then, this paper presents a comprehensive literature review on applications of RL in transportation based on specific topics. The potential future research directions of RL applications and developments are also discussed.

AB  - There are trillions of microbiota in our intestinal tract, and they play a significant role in health and disease via interacting with the host in metabolic, immune, neural, and endocrine pathways. Over the past decades, numerous studies have been published in the field of gut microbiome and disease. Although there are narrative reviews of gut microbiome and certain diseases, the whole field is lack of systematic and quantitative analysis. Therefore, we outline research status of the gut microbiome and disease, and present insights into developments and characteristics of this field to provide a holistic grasp and future research directions.An advanced search was carried out in the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), basing on the term "gut microbiome" and its synonyms. The current status and developing trends of this scientific domain were evaluated by bibliometric methodology. CiteSpace was used to perform collaboration network analysis, co-citation analysis and citation burst detection.A total of 29,870 articles and 13,311 reviews were retrieved from the database, which involve 42,900 keywords, 176 countries/regions, 19,065 institutions, 147,225 authors and 4,251 journals. The gut microbiome and disease research is active and has received increasing attention. Co-cited reference analysis revealed the landmark articles in the field. The United States had the largest number of publications and close cooperation with other countries. The current research mainly focuses on gastrointestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), while extra-intestinal diseases are also rising, such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease. Omics technologies, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and metabolites linked to mechanism would be more concerned in the future.The gut microbiome and disease has been a booming field of research, and the trend is expected to continue. Overall, this research field shows a multitude of challenges and great opportunities.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Remote sensing (RS) has unique advantages over traditional satellite RS, including convenience, high resolution, affordability and fast acquisition speed, making it widely used in many fields. To provide an overview of the development of UAV RS applications during the past decade, we screened related publications from the Web of Science core database from 2010 to 2021, built co-author networks, a discipline interaction network, a keywords timeline view, a co-citation cluster, and detected burst citations using bibliometrics and social network analysis. Our results show that: (1) The number of UAV RS publications had an increasing trend, with explosive growth in the past five years. The number of papers published by China and the United States (US) is far ahead in this field; (2) The US has currently the greatest influence in this field through the largest number of international cooperations. Cooperation is mainly concentrated in countries and institutions with a large number of publications but is not widely distributed. (3) The application of UAV RS involves multiple interdisciplinary subjects, among which “Environmental Science and Ecology” ranks first; (4) Future research trends of UAV RS are expected to be related to artificial intelligence (e.g., artificial neural networks-based research). This paper provides a scientific basis and guidance for future developments of UAV RS applications, which can help the research community to better grasp the developments of this field.

AB  - The proliferation of misinformation presents a significant challenge in today’s information landscape, impacting various aspects of society. While misinformation is often confused with terms like disinformation and fake news, it is crucial to distinguish that misinformation involves, in mostcases, inaccurate information without the intent to cause harm. In some instances, individuals unwittingly share misinformation, driven by a desire to assist others without thorough research. However, there are also situations where misinformation involves negligence, or even intentional manipulation, with the aim of shaping the opinions and decisions of the target audience. Another key factor contributing to misinformation is its alignment with individual beliefs and emotions. This alignment magnifies the impact and influence of misinformation, as people tend to seek information that reinforces their existing beliefs. As a starting point, some 56 papers containing ‘misinformation detection’ in the title, abstract, or keywords, marked as “articles”, written in English, published between 2016 and 2022, were extracted from the Web of Science platform and further analyzed using Biblioshiny. This bibliometric study aims to offer a comprehensive perspective on the field of misinformation detection by examining its evolution and identifying emerging trends, influential authors, collaborative networks, highly cited articles, key terms, institutional affiliations, themes, and other relevant factors. Additionally, the study reviews the most cited papers and provides an overview of all selected papers in the dataset, shedding light on methods employed to counter misinformation and the primary research areas where misinformation detection has been explored, including sources such as online social networks, communities, and news platforms. Recent events related to health issues stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic have heightened interest within the research community regarding misinformation detection, a statistic which is also supported by the fact that half of the papers included in top 10 papers based on number of citations have addressed this subject. The insights derived from this analysis contribute valuable knowledge to address the issue, enhancing our understanding of the field’s dynamics and aiding in the development of effective strategies to detect and mitigate the impact of misinformation. The results spotlight that IEEE Access occupies the first position in the current analysis based on the number of published papers, the King Saud University is listed as the top contributor for the misinformation detection, while in terms of countries, the top-5 list based on the highest contribution to this area is made by the USA, India, China, Spain, and the UK. Moreover, the study supports the promotion of verified and reliable sources of data, fostering a more informed and trustworthy information environment.

AB  - Background: The past decade has seen major advances in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to solve various biomedical problems, including cancer. This has resulted in more than 6000 scientific papers focusing on AI in oncology alone. The expansiveness of this research area presents a challenge to those seeking to understand how it has developed. A scientific analysis of AI in the oncology literature is therefore crucial for understanding its overall structure and development. This may be addressed through bibliometric analysis, which employs computational and visual tools to identify research activity, relationships, and expertise within large collections of bibliographic data. There is already a large volume of research data regarding the development of AI applications in cancer research. However, there is no published bibliometric analysis of this topic that offers comprehensive insights into publication growth, co-citation networks, research collaboration, and keyword co-occurrence analysis for technological trends involving AI across the entire spectrum of oncology research. The purpose of this study is to investigate documents published during the last decade using bibliometric indicators and network visualization. This will provide a detailed assessment of global research activities, key themes, and AI trends over the entire breadth of the oncology field. It will also specifically highlight top-performing authors, organizations, and nations that have made major contributions to this research domain, as well as their interactions via network collaboration maps and betweenness centrality metric. This study represents the first global investigation of AI covering the entire cancer field and using several validated bibliometric techniques. It should provide valuable reference material for reorienting this field and for identifying research trajectories, topics, major publications, and influential entities including scholars, institutions, and countries. It will also identify international collaborations at three levels: micro (that of an individual researcher), meso (that of an institution), and macro (that of a country), in order to inform future lines of research. Methods: The Science Citation Index Expanded from the Web of Science Core Collection was searched for articles and reviews pertaining exclusively to AI in cancer from 2012 through 2022. Annual publication trends were plotted using Microsoft Excel 2019. CiteSpace and VOSViewer were used to investigate the most productive countries, researchers, journals, as well as the sharing of resources, intellectual property, and knowledge base in this field, along with the co-citation analysis of references and keywords. Results: A total of 6757 documents were retrieved. China produced the most publications of any country (2087, 30.89%), and Sun Yat Sen University the highest number (167, 2.47%) of any institute. WEI WANG was the most prolific author (33, 0.49%). RUI ZHANG ranked first for highest betweenness centrality (0.21) and collaboration criteria. Scientific Reports was found to be the most prolific journal (208, 3.18%), while PloS one had the most co-citations (2121, 1.55%). Strong and ongoing citation bursts were found for keywords such as “tissue microarray”, “tissue segmentation”, and “artificial neural network”. Conclusions: Deep learning currently represents one of the most cutting-edge and applicable branches of AI in oncology. The literature to date has dealt extensively with radiomics, genomics, pathology, risk stratification, lesion detection, and therapy response. Current hot topics identified by our analysis highlight the potential application of AI in radiomics and precision oncology.

AB  - Permafrost is a significant part of the cryosphere, which has gained increasing attention from scientists, policy-makers, and the general public due to global warming, environmental degradation, water shortages, and intense human activities. Although many permafrost research review articles have been published, these studies were predominantly limited to either one subject or one field, while systematic studies about permafrost based on bibliometric analysis methods remain limited. We aim to fill this gap by conducting a bibliometric analysis of 13,697 articles in the field of permafrost research from 1942 to 2021, collected from the Web of Science core collection database. The results indicate that permafrost research is a typically multi-author, multi-country, and multi-institution cooperative field, involved in many research fields. The cumulative number of publications has presented an exponential increase over the past 80 years, with an average annual growth rate of 10.40%. Since 2000, China has seen a rapid growth in the number of publications per year, surpassing the USA in 2016 and leading in the years since then. In addition, the authors from China have great contributions in publications, and there is good room for permafrost development in the future according to the authors’ M-index ranking. After the analysis of authors’ keywords, we found that, compared to the conventional methods, machine learning and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) are new technological approaches introduced in recent years, and the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau has become a popular study area. The results presented here can help related researchers, scholars, and students in the field to better understand the past developments, current status, and future trends of permafrost research. Furthermore, this paper presents and expands the general process of the bibliometric method used in permafrost studies, which can provide researchers with new inspirations and improve discipline research approach.

AB  - Rice is one of the most important food crops around the world. Remote sensing technology, as an effective and rapidly developing method, has been widely applied to precise rice management. To observe the current research status in the field of rice remote sensing (RRS), a bibliometric analysis was carried out based on 2680 papers of RRS published during 1980–2021, which were collected from the core collection of the Web of Science database. Quantitative analysis of the number of publications, top countries and institutions, popular keywords, etc. was conducted through the knowledge mapping software CiteSpace, and comprehensive discussions were carried out from the aspects of specific research objects, methods, spectral variables, and sensor platforms. The results revealed that an increasing number of countries and institutions have conducted research on RRS and a great number of articles have been published annually, among which, China, the United States of America, and Japan were the top three and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Zhejiang University, and Nanjing Agricultural University were the first three research institutions with the largest publications. Abundant interest was paid to “reflectance”, followed by “vegetation index” and “yield” and the specific objects mainly focused on growth, yield, area, stress, and quality. From the perspective of spectral variables, reflectance, vegetation index, and back-scattering coefficient appeared the most frequently in the frontiers. In addition to satellite remote sensing data and empirical models, unmanned air vehicle (UAV) platforms and artificial intelligence models have gradually become hot topics. This study enriches the readers’ understanding and highlights the potential future research directions in RRS.

AB  - Conventional fault detection methods in photovoltaic systems face limitations when dealing with emerging monitoring systems that produce vast amounts of high-dimensional data across various domains. Accordingly, great interest appears within the international scientific community for the application of artificial intelligence methods, which are seen as a highly promising solution for effectively managing large datasets for detecting faults. In this review, more than 620 papers published since 2010 on artificial intelligence methods for detecting faults in photovoltaic systems are analyzed. To extract major research trends, in particular to detect most promising algorithms and approaches overcoming excessive time calculations, a conventional bibliographic survey would have been extremely difficult to complete. That is why this study proposes to carry out a review with an innovative approach based on a statistical method named Bibliometric and a Expert qualitative content analysis. This methodology consists of three stages. First, a collection of data from databases is carried out with all precautions to achieve a large, robust, high-quality database. Second, multiple bibliometric indicators are chosen based on the objectives to be achieved and analyzed to assess their real impact, such as the quantity and nature of publications, collaborative connections among organizations, researchers, and countries or most cited articles. Finally, the Expert qualitative content analysis carried out by experts identifies the current and emerging research topics that have the greatest impact on fault detection in photovoltaic systems using artificial intelligence.

AB  - Background: In recent years, with the development of medical science and artificial intelligence, research on rehabilitation robots has gained more and more attention, for nearly 10 years in the Web of Science database by journal of rehabilitation robot-related research literature analysis, to parse and track rehabilitation robot research hotspot and front, and provide some guidance for future research. Methods: This study employed computer retrieval of rehabilitation robot-related research published in the core data collection of the Web of Science database from 2010 to 2020, using CiteSpace 5.7 visualization software. The hotspots and frontiers of rehabilitation robot research are analyzed from the aspects of high-influence countries or regions, institutions, authors, high-frequency keywords, and emergent words. Results: A total of 3,194 articles were included. In recent years, the research on rehabilitation robots has been continuously hot, and the annual publication of relevant literature has shown a trend of steady growth. The United States ranked first with 819 papers, and China ranked second with 603 papers. Northwestern University ranked first with 161 publications. R. Riener, a professor at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, ranked as the first author with 48 articles. The Journal of Neural Engineering and Rehabilitation has the most published research, with 211 publications. In the past 10 years, research has focused on intelligent control, task analysis, and the learning, performance, and reliability of rehabilitation robots to realize the natural and precise interaction between humans and machines. Research on neural rehabilitation robots, brain-computer interface, virtual reality, flexible wearables, task analysis, and exoskeletons has attracted more and more attention. Conclusions: At present, the brain-computer interface, virtual reality, flexible wearables, task analysis, and exoskeleton rehabilitation robots are the research trends and hotspots. Future research should focus on the application of machine learning (ML), dimensionality reduction, and feature engineering technologies in the research and development of rehabilitation robots to improve the speed and accuracy of algorithms. To achieve wide application and commercialization, future rehabilitation robots should also develop toward mass production and low cost. We should pay attention to the functional needs of patients, strengthen multidisciplinary communication and cooperation, and promote rehabilitation robots to better serve the rehabilitation medical field.

AB  - We study whether humans or machine learning (ML) classification models are better at classifying scientific research abstracts according to a fixed set of discipline groups. We recruit both undergraduate and postgraduate assistants for this task in separate stages, and compare their performance against the support vectors machine ML algorithm at classifying European Research Council Starting Grant project abstracts to their actual evaluation panels, which are organised by discipline groups. On average, ML is more accurate than human classifiers, across a variety of training and test datasets, and across evaluation panels. ML classifiers trained on different training sets are also more reliable than human classifiers, meaning that different ML classifiers are more consistent in assigning the same classifications to any given abstract, compared to different human classifiers. While the top five percentile of human classifiers can outperform ML in limited cases, selection and training of such classifiers is likely costly and difficult compared to training ML models. Our results suggest ML models are a cost effective and highly accurate method for addressing problems in comparative bibliometric analysis, such as harmonising the discipline classifications of research from different funding agencies or countries.

AB  - With the development of autonomous driving technology and the internet, automotive human–machine interface (HMI) technology has become an important part of contemporary automotive design. Currently, global automakers are designing a variety of innovative in-car HMIs that illustrate the direction of automotive design in the new era from the perspective of technological aesthetics and experience design. However, sleek designs and innovative experience methods must be built on the basis of safety. Therefore, it is necessary to summarize existing research in the field of automotive HMI and construct a literature review of automotive design research. In this paper, literature on automotive HMI from the Scopus database was analyzed using bibliometric methods such as descriptive analysis, keyword co-occurrence, and literature co-citation network analysis. The final mapping analysis revealed that the current automotive HMI research literature primarily focuses on user research, interface research, external environment research, and technology implementation research related to automotive HMI. The three main stages of automotive HMI research include conceptual construction, system and technology refinement, and user perception research from the perspective of driver assistance and information recognition. Additionally, burst detection suggests that future research should focus on driver assistance, trust levels, and e-HMI information communication.

AB  - Over the past decade, neurorobotics-integrated machine learning has emerged as a new methodology to investigate and address related problems. The combined use of machine learning and neurorobotics allows us to solve problems and find explanatory models that would not be possible with traditional techniques, which are basic within the principles of symmetry. Hence, neuro-robotics has become a new research field. Accordingly, this study aimed to classify existing publications on neurorobotics via content analysis and knowledge mapping. The study also aimed to effectively understand the development trend of neurorobotics-integrated machine learning. Based on data collected from the Web of Science, 46 references were obtained, and bibliometric data from 2013 to 2021 were analyzed to identify the most productive countries, universities, authors, journals, and prolific publications in neurorobotics. CiteSpace was used to visualize the analysis based on co-citations, bibliographic coupling, and co-occurrence. The study also used keyword network analysis to discuss the current status of research in this field and determine the primary core topic network based on cluster analysis. Through the compilation and content analysis of specific bibliometric analyses, this study provides a specific explanation for the knowledge structure of the relevant subject area. Finally, the implications and future research context are discussed as references for future research.

AB  - Abstract Purpose The goal of this study is to explore whether deep learning based embedded models can provide a better visualization solution for large citation networks. Design/methodology/approach Our team compared the visualization approach borrowed from the deep learning community with the well-known bibliometric network visualization for large scale data. 47,294 highly cited papers were visualized by using three network embedding models plus the t-SNE dimensionality reduction technique. Besides, three base maps were created with the same dataset for evaluation purposes. All base maps used the classic OpenOrd method with different edge cutting strategies and parameters. Findings The network embedded maps with t-SNE preserve a very similar global structure to the full edges classic force-directed map, while the maps vary in local structure. Among them, the Node2Vec model has the best overall visualization performance, the local structure has been significantly improved and the maps’ layout has very high stability. Research limitations The computational and time costs of training are very high for network embedded models to obtain high dimensional latent vector. Only one dimensionality reduction technique was tested. Practical implications This paper demonstrates that the network embedding models are able to accurately reconstruct the large bibliometric network in the vector space. In the future, apart from network visualization, many classical vector-based machine learning algorithms can be applied to network representations for solving bibliometric analysis tasks. Originality/value This paper provides the first systematic comparison of classical science mapping visualization with network embedding based visualization on a large scale dataset. We showed deep learning based network embedding model with t-SNE can provide a richer, more stable science map. We also designed a practical evaluation method to investigate and compare maps.

AB  - Construction faces many safety accidents with urbanization, particularly in hoisting. However, there is a lack of systematic review studies in this area. This paper explored the factors and methods of risk assessment in hoisting for industrial building system (IBS) construction. Firstly, bibliometric analysis revealed that future research will focus on “ergonomics”, “machine learning”, “computer simulation”, and “wearable sensors”. Secondly, the previous 80 factors contributing to hoisting risks were summarized from a “human–equipment–management–material–environment” perspective, which can serve as a reference point for managers. Finally, we discussed, in-depth, the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and digital twins (DT). ANNs have improved the efficiency and accuracy of risk assessment. Still, they require high-quality and significant data, which traditional methods do not provide, resulting in the low accuracy of risk simulation results. DT data are emerging as an alternative, enabling stakeholders to visualize and analyze the construction process. However, DT’s interactivity, high cost, and information security need further improvement. Based on the discussion and analysis, the risk control model created in this paper guides the direction for future research.

AB  - The bibliometric analysis investigated the impact of publications on trends in the literature and bioenergy research using artificial intelligence (AI) from 1991 to 2021. In this study, 1721 publications were extracted from the Web of Science, and an analysis of the countries, authorship, institutions, journals, and keywords was visualised. In the recent decades, this field has entered an outbreak phase. India was the most productive country in this area, followed by China, Iran, and the US. It also noted several notable differences between trends and subjects in developed and developing countries. The former led this field at the initial stage and later attached importance to using AI for research feedstock and impact assessment. Developing countries encouraged the advancement of this area and emphasised the feedstock usage of phase treatment and process optimisation. In addition, a co-authorship and institutes study revealed that authors and institutes in distant regions rarely collaborated. The journal analysis shows strong links between Energy, Fuel, and Energy Conversion and Management. Machine learning is by far the most common application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in bioenergy research, with 53% of the articles using it. In these AI-related publications, the keyword artificial neural network (ANN) appeared most frequently in the articles.

AB  - Imbalanced or unbalanced datasets are defined as the highly skewed distribution of target variable in the field of machine learning. Imbalanced datasets have greatly caught the attention of researchers due to their negative effect on machine learning models in the last decade. Researchers develop various solutions to the problems of imbalanced datasets and contribute to the literature.The increasing number of articles makes it difficult to follow the literature. Review articles contribute to the solution of this problem. The goal of this study is to conduct a bibliometric analysis to find solutions for classification with imbalanced datasets. Bibliometric analysis is a quantitative technique based on extracting statistics from databases. This work is the first bibliometric analysis to address the problem of imbalanced datasets. In this study, data on imbalanced datasets were obtained from the Scopus database with the R Bibliometrix package version 3.1.4, and recent studies and new approaches were summarized. Data on 16255 publications between 1957-2021 were collected by using selected keywords. This collection mainly comprises 8871 articles, 6987 conference papers, and 175 reviews with 1, 66 average citations per year per document. Among the most cited countries, the United States has 106139 total citations followed by China with 13839 citations and Germany has 9524 citations.

AB  - Soils are a major player in the global carbon (C) cycle and climate change by functioning as a sink or a source of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). The largest terrestrial C reservoir in soils comprises two main pools: organic (SOC) and inorganic C (SIC), each having distinct fates and functions but with a large disparity in global research attention. This study quantified global soil C research trends and the proportional focus on SOC and SIC pools based on a bibliometric analysis and raise the importance of SIC pools fully underrepresented in research, applications, and modeling. Studies on soil C pools started in 1905 and has produced over 47,000 publications (>1.7 million citations). Although the global C stocks down to 2 m depth are nearly the same for SOC and SIC, the research has dominantly examined SOC (>96 % of publications and citations) with a minimal share on SIC (<4%). Approximately 40 % of the soil C research was related to climate change. Despite poor coverage and publications, the climate change-related research impact (citations per document) of SIC studies was higher than that of SOC. Mineral associated organic carbon, machine learning, soil health, and biochar were the recent top trend topics for SOC research (2020–2023), whereas digital soil mapping, soil properties, soil acidification, and calcite were recent top trend topics for SIC. SOC research was contributed by 151 countries compared to 88 for SIC. As assessed by publications, soil C research was mainly concentrated in a few countries, with only 9 countries accounting for 70 % of the research. China and the USA were the major producers (45 %), collaborators (37 %), and funders of soil C research. SIC is a long-lived soil C pool with a turnover rate (leaching and recrystallization) of more than 1000 years in natural ecosystems, but intensive agricultural practices have accelerated SIC losses, making SIC an important player in global C cycle and climate change. The lack of attention and investment towards SIC research could jeopardize the ongoing efforts to mitigate climate change impacts to meet the 1.5–2.0 °C targets under the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. This bibliographic study calls to expand the research focus on SIC and including SIC fluxes in C budgets and models, without which the representation of the global C cycle is incomplete.

AB  - This research provides a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic interplay between agent-based modeling (ABM) and artificial intelligence (AI) through a meticulous bibliometric study. This study reveals a substantial increase in scholarly interest, particularly post-2006, peaking in 2021 and 2022, indicating a contemporary surge in research on the synergy between AI and ABM. Temporal trends and fluctuations prompt questions about influencing factors, potentially linked to technological advancements or shifts in research focus. The sustained increase in citations per document per year underscores the field’s impact, with the 2021 peak suggesting cumulative influence. Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy (RPYS) reveals historical patterns, and the recent decline prompts exploration into shifts in research focus. Lotka’s law is reflected in the author’s contributions, supported by Pareto analysis. Journal diversity signals extensive exploration of AI applications in ABM. Identifying impactful journals and clustering them per Bradford’s Law provides insights for researchers. Global scientific production dominance and regional collaboration maps emphasize the worldwide landscape. Despite acknowledging limitations, such as citation lag and interdisciplinary challenges, our study offers a global perspective with implications for future research and as a resource in the evolving AI and ABM landscape.

AB  - Despite significant business-related research publications, extant studies are yet to show how well business research directly maps to 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our study uses a qual-quant approach combining the PRISMA framework, performance analysis, and content analysis to find answers to this research gap. Using the Australia Business Deans Council list of 2500+ journals as a proxy for business research during 2016–2022, our study shows that only about 25% of business research is directly mapping to SDGs with SDG 3 (Good Health and Well Being) and SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) being the most mapped. The most cited journals are the Journal of Cleaner Production, Applied Energy, and the European Journal of Public, which largely focus on SDG 7, SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 3. Top authors focus their research mainly on SDG 7, SDG 13, and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), with few publications dedicated to SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and SDG 5 (Gender Equality). Applied Economics has emerged as the dominant field for SDGs. Further, our study is the first to incorporate social network analysis to understand the interconnected nature of SDGs in the context of business research. This research provides substantial policy insight, particularly insight relevant to the formulation of regulations that promote the alignment of business researchers with SDGs.

AB  - In the rapidly developing world of the Internet of Things (IoT), data security has become increasingly important since massive personal data are collected. IoT devices have resource constraints, which makes traditional cryptographic algorithms ineffective for securing IoT devices. To overcome resource limitations, lightweight cryptographic algorithms are needed. To identify research trends and patterns in IoT security, it is crucial to analyze existing works, keywords, authors, journals, and citations. We conducted a bibliometric analysis using performance mapping, science mapping, and enrichment techniques to collect the necessary information. Our analysis included 979 Scopus articles, 214 WOS articles, and 144 IEEE Xplore articles published during 2015–2023, and duplicates were removed. We analyzed and visualized the bibliometric data using R version 4.3.1, VOSviewer version 1.6.19, and the bibliometrix library. We discovered that India is the leading country for this type of research. Archarya and Bansod are the most relevant authors; lightweight cryptography and cryptography are the most relevant terms; and IEEE Access is the most significant journal. Research on lightweight cryptographic algorithms for IoT devices (Raspberry Pi) has been identified as an important area for future research.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the knowledge landscape, hot spots, and research trends in subchondral bone research through bibliometrics. Methods: Web of Science Core Collection database was used to collect articles and reviews on subchondral bone in osteoarthritis published between 2003 and 2022. CiteSpace, VOSviewer, Scimago Graphica, and a bibliometric online analysis platform ( http://bibliometric.com/ ) were used to visualize the knowledge network of countries, institutions, authors, references, and keywords in this field. Both curve fitting and statistical plotting were performed using OriginPro, while correlation analysis was done using SPSS. Results: A total of 3,545 articles and reviews were included. The number of publications on subchondral bone showed an exponential growth trend. The US produced the most (980), followed by China (862) and the United Kingdom (364). Scientific output and gross domestic product were significantly correlated ( r = .948, p &amp;lt; .001). The University of California System and Professor Pelletier Jean-Pierre were the most prolific institutions and influential authors, respectively. The most active and influential journal for subchondral bone research was Osteoarthritis and Cartilage. The majority of papers were financed by NSFC (474, 13.4%), followed by HHS (445, 12.6%), and NIH (438, 12.4%). In recent years, hot keywords have focused on the research of pathomechanisms (e.g., inflammation, apoptosis, pathogenesis, cartilage degeneration/repair, angiogenesis, TGF beta) and therapeutics (e.g., regeneration, stromal cell, mesenchymal stem cell). Conclusion: Subchondral bone research in osteoarthritis is flourishing. Current topics and next research trends would be centered on the pathomechanisms of cellular and molecular interactions in the subchondral bone microenvironment in the development of osteoarthritis and the exploration of targeted treatment medicines for the altered subchondral bone microenvironment.

AB  - Thermal management is a critical challenge in advanced systems such as electric vehicles (EVs), electronic components, and photoelectric modules. Thermal alleviation is carried out through the cooling systems in which the coolant and the heat exchangers are the key components. The study examines recent literature on nanofluids and heat exchanger tubes along with state-of-the-art concepts being tested for heat transfer intensification. The performance of nanofluids in several common heat transfer tubes' geometries/configurations and the effectiveness of novel heat transfer augmentation mechanisms are presented. Promising results have been reported, showing improved heat transfer parameters with the use of nanofluids and intensification mechanisms like turbulators, fins, grooves, and variations in temperature and flow velocity. These mechanisms enhance dispersion stability, achieve a more uniform temperature distribution, and reduce the boundary layer thickness, resulting in lower tube wall temperatures. Moreover, introducing flow pulsations and magnetic effects further enhances particle mobility and heat exchange. However, there are limitations, such as increased frictional losses and pressure drop due to magnetic effects. The combination of nanofluids, novel heat exchanger tube geometries, and turbulators holds great promise for highly efficient cooling systems in the future. The study also presents a bibliometric analysis that offers valuable insights into the impact and visibility of research in the integration of nanofluids into heat transfer systems. These insights aid in identifying emerging trends and advancing the field towards more efficient and compact systems, paving the way for future advancements.

While machine learning algorithms are increasingly employed for medical analysis and diagnosis, their complexity underscores the importance of understanding how these algorithms explain and interpret data to take informed decisions. This review comprehensively analyzes challenges and solutions presented in the literature, offering an overview of the most recent techniques utilized in this field. It also provides precise definitions of interpretability and explainability, aiming to clarify the distinctions between these concepts and their implications for the decision-making process. Our analysis, based on 448 articles and addressing seven research questions, reveals an exponential growth in this field over the last decade. The psychological dimensions of public perception underscore the necessity for effective communication regarding the capabilities and limitations of artificial intelligence. Researchers are actively developing techniques to enhance interpretability, employing visualization methods and reducing model complexity. However, the persistent challenge lies in finding the delicate balance between achieving high performance and maintaining interpretability. Acknowledging the growing significance of artificial intelligence in aiding medical diagnosis and therapy, and the creation of interpretable artificial intelligence models is considered essential. In this dynamic context, an unwavering commitment to transparency, ethical considerations, and interdisciplinary collaboration is imperative to ensure the responsible use of artificial intelligence. This collective commitment is vital for establishing enduring trust between clinicians and patients, addressing emerging challenges, and facilitating the informed adoption of these advanced technologies in medicine.

The agricultural sector is currently incorporating new technologies from other areas. These phenomena are smart agriculture and smart irrigation. However, a challenge to research is the integration of technologies from different knowledge fields, which has caused theoretical and practical difficulties. Thus, our purpose in this study has been to understand the core of these two themes. We extracted publications in Scopus and used bibliometric methods for high-frequency word and phrase analysis. Research shows that current research on smart agriculture mainly focuses on the Internet of Things, climate change, machine learning, precision agriculture and wireless sensor networks. Simultaneously, the Internet of Things, irrigation systems, soil moisture, wireless sensor networks and climate change have received the most scholarly attention in smart irrigation. This study used cluster analysis to find that the IoT has the most apparent growth rate in smart agriculture and smart irrigation, with five-year growth rates of 1617% and 2285%, respectively. In addition, machine learning, deep learning and neural networks have enormous potential in smart irrigation compared with smart agriculture.

AB  - With the growing number of published scientific papers world-wide, the need to evaluation and quality assessment methods for research papers is increasing. Scientific fields such as scientometrics, informetrics, and bibliometrics establish quantified analysis methods and measurements for evaluating scientific papers. In this area, an important problem is to predict the future influence of a published paper. Particularly, early discrimination between influential papers and insignificant papers may find important applications. In this regard, one of the most important metrics is the number of citations to the paper, since this metric is widely utilized in the evaluation of scientific publications and moreover, it serves as the basis for many other metrics such as h-index. In this paper, we propose a novel method for predicting long-term citations of a paper based on the number of its citations in the first few years after publication. In order to train a citation count prediction model, we employed artificial neural network which is a powerful machine learning tool with recently growing applications in many domains including image and text processing. The empirical experiments show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with respect to the prediction accuracy in both yearly and total prediction of the number of citations.

AB  - Abstract This bibliometric study analyzes 1433 former reviews on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Sustainability, providing a comprehensive overview of the evolving research landscape in this domain. Notably, we observe a substantial annual growth rate of 74% in publications and a remarkable 171% increase in total citations from 2016 to 2022, reflecting a growing interest in this area. We identify the leading countries and institutions contributing to quantitative reviews on SDGs and Sustainability. SDG 12 (Sustainable Consumption and Production) emerges as the most extensively studied and is highly represented in influential journals like Sustainability and the Journal of Cleaner Production . Across various research fields, SDGs 12 and 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) stand out, with SDGs 4 (Quality Education), 5 (Gender Equality), and 15 (Life on Land) showing significance in specific domains. Thematic analysis reveals key topics like environmental protection, circular economy, life cycle assessment, and supply chain management, with strong connections to SDG 12. Further clusters highlight environmental management, renewable energy, and energy policy linked to SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), along with a smaller cluster focusing on urbanization driven by SDG 11. Network analysis emphasizes the critical roles of SDGs 12 and 9 (Industry Innovation and Infrastructure) in achieving a sustainable future. However, alternative social network indicators highlight the potential influence of SDGs 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) on other goals. Intriguingly, mainstream SDG research predominantly focuses on SDGs 3 and 7, presenting challenges due to the volume and complexity of related publications. While SDG 7 could find suitable outlets in leading journals, addressing SDG 3’s (Good Health and Well Being) complexity remains a formidable task. Nevertheless, conducting bibliometric studies on SDGs 3, 7, and 13 (Climate Action) offers promising opportunities in future if the associated challenges are addressed effectively.

AB  - To illustrate the knowledge hotspots and cutting-edge research trends of 18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics, the knowledge structure of was systematically explored and the visualization map was analyzed.Studies related to 18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics from 2013 to 2021 were identified and selected from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) using retrieval formula based on an interview. Bibliometric methods are mainly performed by CiteSpace 5.8.R3, which we use to build knowledge structures including publications, collaborative and co-cited studies, burst analysis, and so on. The performance and relevance of countries, institutions, authors, and journals were measured by knowledge maps. The research foci were analyzed through research of keywords, as well as literature co-citation analysis. Predicting trends of 18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics in this field utilizes a citation burst detection method.Through a systematic literature search, 457 articles, which were mainly published in the United States (120 articles) and China (83 articles), were finally included in this study for analysis. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Southern Medical University are the most productive institutions, both with a frequency of 17. 18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics-related literature was frequently published with high citation in European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (IF9.236, 2020), Frontiers in Oncology (IF6.244, 2020), and Cancers (IF6.639, 2020). Further cluster profile of keywords and literature revealed that the research hotspots were primarily concentrated in the fields of image, textural feature, and positron emission tomography, and the hot research disease is a malignant tumor. Document co-citation analysis suggested that many scholars have a co-citation relationship in studies related to imaging biomarkers, texture analysis, and immunotherapy simultaneously. Burst detection suggests that adenocarcinoma studies are frontiers in 18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics, and the landmark literature put emphasis on the reproducibility of 18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics features.First, this bibliometric study provides a new perspective on 18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics research, especially for clinicians and researchers providing scientific quantitative analysis to measure the performance and correlation of countries, institutions, authors, and journals. Above all, there will be a continuing growth in the number of publications and citations in the field of 18F-FDG PET/CT. Second, the international research frontiers lie in applying 18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics to oncology research. Furthermore, new insights for researchers in future studies will be adenocarcinoma-related analyses. Moreover, our findings also offer suggestions for scholars to give attention to maintaining the reproducibility of 18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics features.

AB  - Abstract Research on teacher beliefs has gained significant attention from scholars, resulting in a vast body of literature. To understand the current trends, themes, key contributors, and emerging areas in this domain, we utilized CiteSpace to review 1,731 teacher beliefs publications from 1951 to 2023 through the WOS database. The findings indicate that:1) Over recent decades, there has been a consistent increase in publications concerning teacher beliefs, which is still promising in recent years. 2) The research themes can be divided into professional development, teaching practices, self-efficacy, theoretical orientation, and student performance. 3) There is a noticeable lack of collaboration both across academic institutions and among different authors in the field of teacher beliefs research. 4) In terms of research hotspots, it can be roughly divided into the external environment, the belief ontology, and teaching practices. 5) In terms of research frontiers, four main research frontiers were identified in different periods: epistemological belief, implementation, inclusive education, and English. This study contributes to researchers’ understanding of the developmental trajectory of teacher beliefs research, thus providing references and guidance for future research endeavors.

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in ophthalmological disease screening and diagnostics, medical image diagnostics, and predicting late-disease progression rates. We reviewed all AI publications associated with macular edema (ME) research Between 2011 and 2022 and performed modeling, quantitative, and qualitative investigations. Methods: On 1st February 2023, we screened the Web of Science Core Collection for AI applications related to ME, from which 297 studies were identified and analyzed (2011-2022). We collected information on: publications, institutions, country/region, keywords, journal name, references, and research hotspots. Literature clustering networks and Frontier knowledge bases were investigated using bibliometrix-BiblioShiny, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace bibliometric platforms. We used the R "bibliometrix" package to synopsize our observations, enumerate keywords, visualize collaboration networks between countries/regions, and generate a topic trends plot. VOSviewer was used to examine cooperation between institutions and identify citation relationships between journals. We used CiteSpace to identify clustering keywords over the timeline and identify keywords with the strongest citation bursts. Results: In total, 47 countries published AI studies related to ME; the United States had the highest H-index, thus the greatest influence. China and the United States cooperated most closely between all countries. Also, 613 institutions generated publications - the Medical University of Vienna had the highest number of studies. This publication record and H-index meant the university was the most influential in the ME field. Reference clusters were also categorized into 10 headings: retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) fluid detection, convolutional network models, deep learning (DL)-based single-shot predictions, retinal vascular disease, diabetic retinopathy (DR), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), automated macular pathology diagnosis, dry age-related macular degeneration (DARMD), class weight, and advanced DL architecture systems. Frontier keywords were represented by diabetic macular edema (DME) (2021-2022). Conclusion: Our review of the AI-related ME literature was comprehensive, systematic, and objective, and identified future trends and current hotspots. With increased DL outputs, the ME research focus has gradually shifted from manual ME examinations to automatic ME detection and associated symptoms. In this review, we present a comprehensive and dynamic overview of AI in ME and identify future research areas.

AB  - The blood supply chain is an inseparable part of health systems. The importance of blood and the difficulties of managing the blood supply chain have led to numerous publications on this topic over the last two decades. This study seeks to reveal the state of the art of the blood supply chain and provide research gaps and future research directions. For this purpose, a mixed review methodology is conducted that includes bibliometric analysis, network analysis, and a six-dimension taxonomy. Bibliometric analysis identifies the most contributing journals, authors, and countries as well as provides popular keywords, while network analysis reveals interactions between these components. Taxonomy clarifies decision models and research gaps with a deeper examination. The electronic database Web of Science is examined to uncover relevant articles. In total, 265 articles are analyzed in detail. The findings reveal that the blood supply chain gathers more interest from researchers, and despite the continuing dominance of the inventory stage, there is an upward trend in the literature for the research of the blood supply chain as a whole. Optimization techniques come forward in the blood supply chain topic as solution methodology. In accordance with the results of bibliometric analysis, network analysis, and taxonomy, six prospective directions for future research are emphasized.

AB  - Cancer has become a major threat to global health care. With the development of computer science, artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely applied in histopathological images (HI) analysis. This study analyzed the publications of AI in HI from 2001 to 2021 by bibliometrics, exploring the research status and the potential popular directions in the future. A total of 2844 publications from the Web of Science Core Collection were included in the bibliometric analysis. The country/region, institution, author, journal, keyword, and references were analyzed by using VOSviewer and CiteSpace. The results showed that the number of publications has grown rapidly in the last five years. The USA is the most productive and influential country with 937 publications and 23,010 citations, and most of the authors and institutions with higher numbers of publications and citations are from the USA. Keyword analysis showed that breast cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer are the tumor types of greatest concern. Co-citation analysis showed that classification and nucleus segmentation are the main research directions of AI-based HI studies. Transfer learning and self-supervised learning in HI is on the rise. This study performed the first bibliometric analysis of AI in HI from multiple indicators, providing insights for researchers to identify key cancer types and understand the research trends of AI application in HI.

AB  - The COVID-19 global pandemic has generated an abundance of research quickly following the outbreak. Within only a few months, more than a thousand studies on this topic have already appeared in the scientific literature. In this short review, we analyse the bibliometric aspects of these studies on a macro level, as well as those addressing Coronaviruses in general. Furthermore, through a scoping analysis of the literature on COVID-19, we identify the main safety-related dimensions that these studies have thus far addressed. Our findings show that across various research domains, and apart from the medical and clinical aspects such as the safety of vaccines and treatments, issues related to patient transport safety, occupational safety of healthcare professionals, biosafety of laboratories and facilities, social safety, food safety, and particularly mental/psychological health and domestic safety have thus far attracted most attention of the scientific community in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis also uncovers various potentially significant safety problems caused by this global health emergency which currently have attracted only limited scientific focus but may warrant more attention. These include matters such as cyber safety, economic safety, and supply-chain safety. These findings highlight why, from an academic research perspective, a holistic interdisciplinary approach and a collective scientific effort is required to help understand and mitigate the various safety impacts of this crisis whose implications reach far beyond the bio-medical risks. Such holistic safety-scientific understanding of the COVID-19 crisis can furthermore be instrumental to be better prepared for a future pandemic.

AB  - Big data technology has been widely used in entrepreneurial research in recent years. To explore the development trend and fundamental characteristics of big data in entrepreneurship (BDIE) research, we conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of BDIE based on 541 publications between 1993 and 2020 from Web of Science. On the one hand, this paper focuses on some essential characteristics of the BDIE publications, such as categories, citation, H-index, and the most cited publications. On the other hand, visual scientific maps are presented by bibliometric tools, i.e., Bibliometrix, VOS viewer, and CorTexT Manager, showing relationships between publications and knowledge structure in BDIE research. Finally, hot topics in current studies, knowledge, and limitations are discussed, guiding scholars to explore new research directions. This paper provides a relatively broad perspective for applying BDIE research, which contributes to understanding the evolution of BDIE research and inspires scholars in related fields.

AB  - Background and aims Gastrointestinal microbial metabolomics is closely related to the state of the organism and has significant interaction with the pathogenesis of many diseases. Based on the publications in Web of Science Core Collection(WoSCC) from 2004 to 2022, this study conducted a bibliometric analysis of this field, aiming to understand its development trend and frontier, and provide basic information and potential points for in-depth exploration of this field. Methods All articles on gastrointestinal flora and metabolism published from 2004 to 2022 were collected and identified in WoCSS. CiteSpace v.6.1 and VOSviewer v.1.6.15.0 were used to calculate bibliometric indicators, including number of publications and citations, study categories, countries/institutions, authors/co-cited authors, journals/co-cited journals, co-cited references, and keywords. A map was drawn to visualize the data based on the analysis results for a more intuitive view. Results There were 3811 articles in WoSCC that met our criteria. Analysis results show that the number of publications and citations in this field are increasing year by year. China is the country with the highest number of publications and USA owns the highest total link strength and citations. Chinese Acad Sci rank first for the number of institutional publications and total link strength. Journal of Proteome Research has the most publications. Nicholson, Jeremy K. is one of the most important scholars in this field. The most cited reference is “Gut flora metabolism of phosphatidylcholine promotes cardiovascular disease”. Burst detection indicates that Urine, spectroscopy, metabonomic and gut microflora are long-standing hot topics in this field, while autism spectrum disorder and omics are likely to be at the forefront of research. The study of related metabolic small molecules and the application of gastrointestinal microbiome metabolomics in various diseases are currently emerging research directions and frontier in this field.

AB  - The integration of social science with computer science and engineering fields has produced a new area of study: computational social science. This field applies computational methods to novel sources of digital data such as social media, administrative records, and historical archives to develop theories of human behavior. We review the evolution of this field within sociology via bibliometric analysis and in-depth analysis of the following subfields where this new work is appearing most rapidly: ( a) social network analysis and group formation; ( b) collective behavior and political sociology; ( c) the sociology of knowledge; ( d) cultural sociology, social psychology, and emotions; ( e) the production of culture; ( f) economic sociology and organizations; and ( g) demography and population studies. Our review reveals that sociologists are not only at the center of cutting-edge research that addresses longstanding questions about human behavior but also developing new lines of inquiry about digital spaces as well. We conclude by discussing challenging new obstacles in the field, calling for increased attention to sociological theory, and identifying new areas where computational social science might be further integrated into mainstream sociology.

AB  - Abstract Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have driven extensive research into developing diverse multimodal data analysis approaches for smart healthcare. There is a scarcity of large-scale analysis of literature in this field based on quantitative approaches. This study performed a bibliometric and topic modeling examination on 683 articles from 2002 to 2022, focusing on research topics and trends, journals, countries/regions, institutions, authors, and scientific collaborations. Results showed that, firstly, the number of articles has grown from 1 in 2002 to 220 in 2022, with a majority being published in interdisciplinary journals that link healthcare and medical research and information technology and AI. Secondly, the significant rise in the quantity of research articles can be attributed to the increasing contribution of scholars from non-English speaking countries/regions and the noteworthy contributions made by authors in the USA and India. Thirdly, researchers show a high interest in diverse research issues, especially, cross-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for brain tumor analysis, cancer prognosis through multi-dimensional data analysis, and AI-assisted diagnostics and personalization in healthcare, with each topic experiencing a significant increase in research interest. There is an emerging trend towards issues such as applying generative adversarial networks and contrastive learning for multimodal medical image fusion and synthesis and utilizing the combined spatiotemporal resolution of functional MRI and electroencephalogram in a data-centric manner. This study is valuable in enhancing researchers’ and practitioners’ understanding of the present focal points and upcoming trajectories in AI-powered smart healthcare based on multimodal data analysis.

AB  - First dedicated articles about placebo effects have been published in the 1940s, and more than 5,000 articles have been published in scientific organs since. However, the evolution of this research field has rarely been examined. By means of bibliometric analyses we aim to generate research metrics such as the number and types of publications as well as topics, authorship networks, impacts, and future directions.Bibliometric methods were applied to the Journal of Interdisciplinary Placebo Studies (JIPS) database. It comprises around 5,000 scientific articles dedicated to researching placebo effects and mechanisms and is expanded continually through individual curation, making it a prime candidate for investigation. Web scraping was used to obtain complete article information from PubMed and Web of Science. The same information was obtained for addiction research as reference field. Analyses include a general characterization of the database as well as focus points concerning publication types (data vs. non-data articles), high-impact publications and more.Analyses show that the JIPS database is a comprehensive collection of placebo publications. The development of the field is comparable to that of the comparator field and scientific publication in general. The most frequently used keywords describe populations or study design topics; the most frequent symptoms were pain, depression and anxiety. Data and non-data (e.g., review) papers are related in proportion of about 6:4 in recent decades, indicating a stable degree of productivity. A network of 26 interconnected researchers was identified who published 25 or more articles. Placebo research contributes comparable numbers of publications to high-impact journals as the comparator field. Several additional analyses are performed, with a focus on visualization of various database parameters.Bibliometric analyses of the JIPS database can be used to answer questions to the field, for example, to get an impression of blind spots and future directions. However, keywords used in indexing and publications themselves are often general and suggest that placebo research may still be considered a subspecialty of superordinate fields, particularly since there are no journals dedicated to placebo research itself. We invite interested colleagues to use this database for further analyses.

AB  - The analysis of contemporary society, characterized by technological, economic, political, social, and cultural changes, has become more challenging due to the development of the internet and information and communication technologies, which provide a vast and increasingly valuable source of information, knowledge, and data. Within this context, so-called open data-that is, data that are made public, especially by public administrations, through an open governance model (transparent and accessible to citizens) are assuming a significant role. This is a topic of growing importance that scientific research is addressing in an attempt to discern the multiplicity of social, educational, legal, technological, statistical, and methodological issues that underlie the creation and use of such data. This article aims to provide insights into understanding scientific trends on the topic of open data through a bibliometric approach. Specifically, a total of 3,110 publications related to the disciplinary fields of the social sciences and humanities published from 2013 to 2022 were collected. The data was then analyzed using network and factorial analysis techniques to detect the conceptual structure to identify the trends of topics and perspectives of research that characterize open data studies.

AB  - Over the last two decades, green and sustainable business models (GnSBMs) have become a prominent topic of discussion among scholars, practitioners and policymakers. Preponderance of research and an increasing global pressure to adopt GnSBMs necessitate a comprehensive understanding of the state of research on GnSBMs. Towards this end, we extracted 851 publications on GnSBMs from the Scopus database and employed a series of bibliometrical techniques to: (1) explore the historical roots and sleeping beauties, (2) assess the life cycle, (3) map the conceptual evolution and (4) propose a research agenda for this growing field. Our analysis revealed that research on GnSBMs is moving from a multidisciplinary to an interdisciplinary domain. Its historical roots can be traced to the pioneering works on business strategy in the 1950s, environmental science in the early 1960s and stakeholder theory in the 1980s. Life cycle analysis indicated that research on GnSBM went through an introductory stage from 2002 to 2013 and then began to rapidly grow in 2014, and this growth is forecast to continue until circa 2040. The conceptual structures from 2002 to 2013 and 2014 to 2020 were mapped and an agenda for future research was proposed.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11192-022-04577-2.

AB  - Virtual simulation can solve the challenges of high cost, long cycle time, and inaccessibility in traditional experimental teaching, which is far-reaching for talent training. This study combines bibliometric visualization theory with AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process). It establishes a hierarchical evaluation model of a virtual simulation experimental teaching platform based on 842 questionnaires and 4787 articles, including 68,306 citation records, and deconstructing the complex evaluation problem into several multidimensional factors by attributes and relationships. Based on this, a virtual simulation experimental teaching platform construction scheme for IP protocol analysis based on a network covert communication perspective is outputted, which is compatible with the research results. The experimental platform takes a task-driven teaching method as the core, mainly including four modules of context creation, task determination, independent learning, and effect evaluation. The experience of building this platform can be extended to other disciplines, leading the teaching reform exploration of practice-based, innovation-focused, and engineering-critical, helping to implement the flipped classroom, and promoting the development of education modernization.

AB  - The study of the relationship between education and business is a very relevant issue when education and business are key factors in developing and uplifting the economy. Education is the foundation for creating a business since the effective activity is impossible without a strong information base. The purpose of this research is a bibliographic review of scientific publications devoted to the relationship between business and education, based on materials indexed by the Scopus, Web of Science, and Mendeley databases using the built-in functions of the Bibliometrix application and the R programming language. The logic of the research is implemented with the help of three stages: at the first stage, an analysis of literary sources related to bibliometric analysis, as well as about business and education, the interdependence of education and business, which were published in the publishing house of MDPI scientific journals with open access, was carried out. Survey and interview methods are the methodological tools of most of the analyzed publications in the open access of the MDPI database. The research is conducted in the R language, using VOSViewer tools for bibliometric analysis. Various qualitative and quantitative methods were used to analyze the relationship between education and business, such as performance analysis, scientific mapping and thematic analysis, structural equation modelling, and Z-score statistics. At the second stage, the main functions of the Bibliometrix package were studied, countries, keywords constructed a three-field plot, and the year of publication of cited references to reflect the proportion of research topics for each country and the freshness of cited articles. Source clustering through Bradford’s Law was also used to identify the best journals for publishing own research and searching for the most relevant scientific information. In addition, the Hirsch and Gini indexes of the selected sample of publications were examined in detail within the second stage. The Hirsch index is a quantitative measure of productivity based on analyzing published publications and citations. The distribution of authorship is estimated using the Gini index. At the third stage, keywords were analyzed, and a table was built with the most frequently used words to decrease the number of keywords mentioned. The conducted comprehensive analysis of scientific publications confirmed the close correlation of paradigms of business and education in the conditions of coopetition in modernity.

AB  - Background: The tuberculosis burden is growing in Nigeria along with its population. For example, Nigeria has the sixth highest TB burden globally, with an estimated 4.3 per cent multi-drug resistance in new cases. This study builds on the existing study that examined academic involvement in tuberculosis research. The study in question focused on global medical literature related to tuberculosis, but the non-visibility of some low and middle-income countries in the bigger global picture motivated this present study. Every year, over 245,000 Nigerians succumb to tuberculosis (TB), with approximately 590,000 new cases reported (of these, around 140,000 are also HIV-positive). This study carried out an academic publication evaluation with the VOS viewer tool to map bibliometric data for scholarly articles published between 1991 and 2021 on tuberculosis research and used the Biblioshiny app for analytics and plots of authors, sources, and documents to explore the descriptive statistics of tuberculosis literature. The present study delineates that England has the highest collaborating country with Nigeria in the study of tuberculosis over the years and according to the report, the University of Nigeria, the University of Ibadan, and Nnamdi Azikwe University are Nigerian institutions with extensive collaborations. This study concludes with managerial implications for future actions.&#x0D; Keywords: Tuberculosis; bibliometric; University; Nigeria; collaboration; authors.

AB  - Agent-based models are computational approaches used to reproduce the interactions between economic agents. These models are widely applied in many contexts to get deeper understanding about agents’ behaviors within complex systems. In this paper, we provide a bibliometric analysis about agent-based models in finance and, considering bibliographic coupling, we identify the presence of two distinct clusters of research communities, i.e., financial economics and econophysics. Cluster-specific thematic analyses are conducted to understand if the two communities are characterized by different emerging and motor topics. By highlighting several differences in the clusters, we also show the two research communities specialized in different specific topics.

AB  - We present a method, including tool support, for bibliometric mining of trends in large and dynamic research areas. The method is applied to the machine learning research area for the years 2013 to 2022. A total number of 398,782 documents from Scopus were analyzed. A taxonomy containing 26 research directions within machine learning was defined by four experts with the help of a Python program and existing taxonomies. The trends in terms of productivity, growth rate, and citations were analyzed for the research directions in the taxonomy. Our results show that the two directions, Applications and Algorithms, are the largest, and that the direction Convolutional Neural Networks is the one that grows the fastest and has the highest average number of citations per document. It also turns out that there is a clear correlation between the growth rate and the average number of citations per document, i.e., documents in fast-growing research directions have more citations. The trends for machine learning research in four geographic regions (North America, Europe, the BRICS countries, and The Rest of the World) were also analyzed. The number of documents during the time period considered is approximately the same for all regions. BRICS has the highest growth rate, and, on average, North America has the highest number of citations per document. Using our tool and method, we expect that one could perform a similar study in some other large and dynamic research area in a relatively short time.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with new variants, continues to be a constant pandemic threat that is generating socio-economic and health issues in manifold countries. The principal goal of this study is to develop a machine learning experiment to assess the effects of vaccination on the fatality rate of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from 192 countries are analysed to explain the phenomena under study. This new algorithm selected two targets: the number of deaths and the fatality rate. Results suggest that, based on the respective vaccination plan, the turnout in the participation in the vaccination campaign, and the doses administered, countries under study suddenly have a reduction in the fatality rate of COVID-19 precisely at the point where the cut effect is generated in the neural network. This result is significant for the international scientific community. It would demonstrate the effective impact of the vaccination campaign on the fatality rate of COVID-19, whatever the country considered. In fact, once the vaccination has started (for vaccines that require a booster, we refer to at least the first dose), the antibody response of people seems to prevent the probability of death related to COVID-19. In short, at a certain point, the fatality rate collapses with increasing doses administered. All these results here can help decisions of policymakers to prepare optimal strategies, based on effective vaccination plans, to lessen the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis in socioeconomic and health systems.

AB  - In nonstationary environments, high-dimensional data streams have been generated unceasingly where the underlying distribution of the training and target data may change over time. These drifts are labeled as concept drift in the literature. Learning from evolving data streams demands adaptive or evolving approaches to handle concept drifts, which is a brand-new research affair. In this effort, a wide-ranging comparative analysis of concept drift is represented to highlight state-of-the-art approaches, embracing the last four decades, namely from 1980 to 2020. Considering the scope and discipline; the core collection of the Web of Science database is regarded as the basis of this study, and 1,564 publications related to concept drift are retrieved. As a result of the classification and feature analysis of valid literature data, the bibliometric indicators are revealed at the levels of countries/regions, institutions, and authors. The overall analyses, respecting the publications, citations, and cooperation of networks, are unveiled not only the highly authoritative publications but also the most prolific institutions, influential authors, dynamic networks, etc. Furthermore, deep analyses including text mining such as; the burst detection analysis, co-occurrence analysis, timeline view analysis, and bibliographic coupling analysis are conducted to disclose the current challenges and future research directions. This paper contributes as a remarkable reference for invaluable further research of concept drift, which enlightens the emerging/trend topics, and the possible research directions with several graphs, visualized by using the VOS viewer and Cite Space software.

Additionally, the Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery was the journal with the highest number of publications. The most common keywords were "rotator cuff", "rehabilitation", "physical therapy", "management", and "telerehabilitation".The total number of publications has shown a steady upward trend. The cooperation between countries globally was still relatively lacking, and therefore it is necessary to strengthen cooperation between different countries and regions to provide conditions for multi-center, large sample, and high-quality research. In addition to the relatively mature rehabilitation of rotator cuff injury such as passive motion or exercise therapy, telerehabilitation has also attracted much attention with the progress of science.

AB  - Background: Single-cell sequencing (SCS) is a technique used to analyze the genome, transcriptome, epigenome, and other genetic data at the level of a single cell. The procedure is commonly utilized in multiple fields, including neurobiology, immunology, and microbiology, and has emerged as a key focus of life science research. However, a thorough and impartial analysis of the existing state and trends of SCS-related research is lacking. The current study aimed to map the development trends of studies on SCS during the years 2010–2022 through bibliometric software. Methods: Pertinent papers on SCS from 2010 to 2022 were obtained using the Web of Science Core Collection. Research categories, nations/institutions, authors/co-cited authors, journals/co-cited journals, co-cited references, and keywords were analyzed using VOSviewer, the R package “bibliometric”, and CiteSpace. Results: The bibliometric analysis included 9,929 papers published between 2010 and 2022, and showed a consistent increase in the quantity of papers each year. The United States was the source of the highest quantity of articles and citations in this field. The majority of articles were published in the periodical Nature Communications. Butler A was the most frequently quoted author on this topic, and his article “ Integrating single-cell transcriptome data across diverse conditions, technologies, and species ” has received numerous citations to date. The literature and keyword analysis showed that studies involving single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) were prominent in this discipline during the study period. Conclusion: This study utilized bibliometric techniques to visualize research in SCS-related domains, which facilitated the identification of emerging patterns and future directions in the field. Current hot topics in SCS research include COVID-19, tumor microenvironment, scRNA-seq, and neuroscience. Our results are significant for scholars seeking to identify key issues and generate new research ideas.

AB  - The wealth of published data are valuable because, in addition to contributing to the advancement of scientific, technical, and policy knowledge, they can also provide critical information and guidance regarding published content, subject changes, and trends that demand greater attention. In the 21st century, digital technologies play an increasingly important role in “data capture”, “building management”, “virtual reconstruction”, and “building restoration”. The indispensable role of digital technology in addressing “data capture”, “building management”, “virtual reconstruction”, and “building restoration” has resulted in the publication of several high-quality publications. In this study, we retrieve textual data from Web of Science and mine the content of the documentary data using COOC, VOSviewer, CiteNetwork, and academic influence evaluation (AIE) software to gain insights into the prospects and opportunities for historic architecture and digitization research. The results indicate that greater progress has been made in research on the use of digital technologies for the conservation of historic buildings from 2019 to 2023, but cross-disciplinary, cross-institutional, and cross-border collaboration should be enhanced. The research frontiers identified indicate that photogrammetry, 3D modeling, point cloud, and deep learning will require sustained attention in the near future. Additionally, computational analyses of academic influence reveal that Italian institutions and authors have dominated research in this field in recent years. A new strategy and framework for data-driven bibliometric analysis involving historical architecture and digitization techniques are presented in this study. Based on general bibliometric methods, this study innovatively explores the scientific knowledge base and knowledge flow of highly cited articles, provides comprehensive evaluation indicators such as H-index, G-index, P-index, and Z-index for high-impact journals, institutions, and authors, and proposes a COOC-based idea to address the consistency of data sources among multiple software.

AB  - Background Artificial intelligence (AI), conceived in the 1950s, has permeated numerous industries, intensifying in tandem with advancements in computing power. Despite the widespread adoption of AI, its integration into medicine trails other sectors. However, medical AI research has experienced substantial growth, attracting considerable attention from researchers and practitioners. Objective In the absence of an existing framework, this study aims to outline the current landscape of medical AI research and provide insights into its future developments by examining all AI-related studies within PubMed over the past 2 decades. We also propose potential data acquisition and analysis methods, developed using Python (version 3.11) and to be executed in Spyder IDE (version 5.4.3), for future analogous research. Methods Our dual-pronged approach involved (1) retrieving publication metadata related to AI from PubMed (spanning 2000-2022) via Python, including titles, abstracts, authors, journals, country, and publishing years, followed by keyword frequency analysis and (2) classifying relevant topics using latent Dirichlet allocation, an unsupervised machine learning approach, and defining the research scope of AI in medicine. In the absence of a universal medical AI taxonomy, we used an AI dictionary based on the European Commission Joint Research Centre AI Watch report, which emphasizes 8 domains: reasoning, planning, learning, perception, communication, integration and interaction, service, and AI ethics and philosophy. Results From 2000 to 2022, a comprehensive analysis of 307,701 AI-related publications from PubMed highlighted a 36-fold increase. The United States emerged as a clear frontrunner, producing 68,502 of these articles. Despite its substantial contribution in terms of volume, China lagged in terms of citation impact. Diving into specific AI domains, as the Joint Research Centre AI Watch report categorized, the learning domain emerged dominant. Our classification analysis meticulously traced the nuanced research trajectories across each domain, revealing the multifaceted and evolving nature of AI’s application in the realm of medicine. Conclusions The research topics have evolved as the volume of AI studies increases annually. Machine learning remains central to medical AI research, with deep learning expected to maintain its fundamental role. Empowered by predictive algorithms, pattern recognition, and imaging analysis capabilities, the future of AI research in medicine is anticipated to concentrate on medical diagnosis, robotic intervention, and disease management. Our topic modeling outcomes provide a clear insight into the focus of AI research in medicine over the past decades and lay the groundwork for predicting future directions. The domains that have attracted considerable research attention, primarily the learning domain, will continue to shape the trajectory of AI in medicine. Given the observed growing interest, the domain of AI ethics and philosophy also stands out as a prospective area of increased focus.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explain language education development research for improving student comprehension in learning science. This study also reviews the definition of these strategies, identifies factors that contribute to improving students' comprehension, and conducts a computational bibliometric review analysis to determine the efficacy of these approaches using Google Scholar with keywords "Language" and "Learning Science" from 2019 to 2023. There are also explanations for formal and informal learning, as well as educational levels for researching techniques and developing curriculum. The use of technology in media and laboratories is also a significant factor in increasing students' literacy and language impact. Language and student characteristics, motivation, teacher-student relationships, therapy, and psychological conditions are all inextricably linked. We also included information about language barriers for students with special needs, as well as new technologies that improve language learning, in which these can be factors in increasing student’s understanding of learning science. The bibliometric analysis results show that the trend of language research in learning science is decreasing year after year. This is due to the possibility that the focus of educational research has shifted to other areas, such as educational technology, science learning, or educational policy. The co-occurrence analysis results show several keywords that are frequently researched and should be paid attention to, including "language model," "natural language processing," "deep learning," "student," and "language learning." These keywords denote important parameters that can improve the learning experience because they enable personalized, interactive, adaptive educational interventions, particularly in language learning contexts, by adapting content and feedback to each student's needs and preferences. This paper will be useful to educators in better understanding the current state of affairs concerning the importance of language in engineering teaching and learning.

AB  - Performance evaluation is one of the most critical components in assuring the comprehensive development of e-learning in medical education (e-LMED). Although several studies evaluate performance in e-LMED, no study presently maps the rising scientific knowledge and evolutionary patterns that establish a solid background to investigate and quantify the efficacy of the evaluation of performance in e-LMED. Therefore, this study aims to quantify scientific productivity, identify the key terms and analyze the extent of research collaboration in this domain. We searched the SCOPUS database using search terms informed by the PICOS model, and a total of 315 studies published between 1991 and 2022 were retrieved. Performance analysis, science mapping, network analysis, and visualization were performed using R Bibliometrix, Biblioshiny, and VOSviewer packages. Findings reveal that authors are actively publishing and collaborating in this domain, which experienced a sporadic publication increase in 2021. Most of the top publications, collaborations, countries, institutions, and journals are produced in first-world countries. In addition, studies evaluating performance in e-LMED evaluated constructs such as efficacy, knowledge gain, student perception, confidence level, acceptability, feasibility, usability, and willingness to recommend e-learning, mainly using pre-tests and post-tests experimental design methods. This study can help researchers understand the existing landscape of performance evaluation in e-LMED and could be used as a background to investigate and quantify the efficacy of the evaluation of e-LMED.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a growing interest in flood susceptibility modeling. In this study, we conducted a bibliometric analysis followed by a meta-data analysis to capture the nature and evolution of literature, intellectual structure networks, emerging themes, and knowledge gaps in flood susceptibility modeling. Relevant publications were retrieved from the Web of Science database to identify the leading authors, influential journals, and trending articles. The results of the meta-data analysis indicated that hybrid models were the most frequently used prediction models. Results of bibliometric analysis show that GIS, machine learning, statistical models, and the analytical hierarchy process were the central focuses of this research area. The analysis also revealed that slope, elevation, and distance from the river are the most commonly used factors in flood susceptibility modeling. The present study discussed the importance of the resolution of input data, the size and representation of the training sample, other lessons learned, and future research directions in this field.

AB  - In this study, we explored the dynamic field of fuzzy logic and artificial intelligence (AI) in financial analysis from 1990 to 2023. Utilizing the bibliometrix package in RStudio and data from the Web of Science, we focused on identifying mathematical models and the evolving role of fuzzy information granulation in this domain. The research addresses the urgent need to understand the development and impact of fuzzy logic and AI within the broader scope of evolving technological and analytical methodologies, particularly concentrating on their application in financial and banking contexts. The bibliometric analysis involved an extensive review of the literature published during this period. We examined key metrics such as the annual growth rate, international collaboration, and average citations per document, which highlighted the field’s expansion and collaborative nature. The results revealed a significant annual growth rate of 19.54%, international collaboration of 21.16%, and an average citation per document of 25.52. Major journals such as IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, the Journal of Intelligent &amp; Fuzzy Systems, and Information Sciences emerged as significant contributors, aligning with Bradford’s Law’s Zone 1. Notably, post-2020, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems showed a substantial increase in publications. A significant finding was the high citation rate of seminal research on fuzzy information granulation, emphasizing its mathematical importance and practical relevance in financial analysis. Keywords like “design”, “model”, “algorithm”, “optimization”, “stabilization”, and terms such as “fuzzy logic controller”, “adaptive fuzzy controller”, and “fuzzy logic approach” were prevalent. The Countries’ Collaboration World Map indicated a strong pattern of global interconnections, suggesting a robust framework of international collaboration. Our study highlights the escalating influence of fuzzy logic and AI in financial analysis, marked by a growth in research outputs and global collaborations. It underscores the crucial role of fuzzy information granulation as a mathematical model and sets the stage for further investigation into how fuzzy logic and AI-driven models are transforming financial and banking analysis practices worldwide.

AB  - Introduction Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder that has become a major cause of disability in children. Digital therapeutics (DTx) delivers evidence-based therapeutic interventions to patients that are driven by software to prevent, manage, or treat a medical disorder or disease. This study objectively analyzed the current research status of global DTx in ASD from 2002 to 2022, aiming to explore the current global research status and trends in the field. Methods The Web of Science database was searched for articles about DTx in ASD from January 2002 to October 2022. CiteSpace was used to analyze the co-occurrence of keywords in literature, partnerships between authors, institutions, and countries, the sudden occurrence of keywords, clustering of keywords over time, and analysis of references, cited authors, and cited journals. Results A total of 509 articles were included. The most productive country and institution were the United States and Vanderbilt University. The largest contributing authors were Warren, Zachary, and Sarkar, Nilanjan. The most-cited journal was the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders . The most-cited and co-cited articles were Brian Scarselati (Robots for Use in Autism Research, 2012) and Ralph Adolphs (Abnormal processing of social information from faces in autism, 2001). “Artificial Intelligence,” “machine learning,” “Virtual Reality,” and “eye tracking” were common new and cutting-edge trends in research on DTx in ASD. Discussion The use of DTx in ASD is developing rapidly and gaining the attention of researchers worldwide. The publications in this field have increased year by year, mainly concentrated in the developed countries, especially in the United States. Both Vanderbilt University and Yale University are very important institutions in the field. The researcher from Vanderbilt University, Warren and Zachary, his dynamics or achievements in the field is also more worth our attention. The application of new technologies such as virtual reality, machine learning, and eye-tracking in this field has driven the development of DTx on ASD and is currently a popular research topic. More cross-regional and cross-disciplinary collaborations are recommended to advance the development and availability of DTx.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze the related research on the influence of dietary patterns on IBD carried out over the past 30 years to obtain the context of the research field and to provide a scientific basis and guidance for the prevention and treatment of IBD.The literature on the effects of dietary patterns on inflammatory bowel disease published over the past three decades was retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. CiteSpace, VOSviewer, the R software (version 4.3.0) bibliometrix package, the OALM platform, and other tools were used for the analyses.The growth of scientific papers related to this topic can be divided into two stages: before and after 2006. Overall, the growth of the relevant literature was in line with Price's literature growth curve. Subrata Ghosh and Antonio Gasbarrini are the authors with the highest academic influence in the field, and Lee D.'s research results are widely recognized by researchers in this field. Among the 72 countries involved in the study, the United States contributed the most, while China developed rapidly with regard to research being carried out in this area. From a regional perspective, countries and institutions in North America, Europe, and East Asia have made the most significant contributions to this field and have the closest cooperation. Among the 1074 articles included in the study, the most influential ones tended to consider the mechanism of the effect of dietary patterns on IBD from the perspective of the microbiome. Multiple tools were used for keyword analysis and mutual verification. The results showed that NF-κB, the Mediterranean diet, fatty acids, fecal microbiota, etc., are the focus and trends of current research.A Mediterranean-like dietary pattern may be a good dietary habit for IBD patients. Carbohydrates, fatty acids, and inulin-type fructans are closely related to IBD. Fatty acid, gut microbiota, NF-κB, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum stress are the hot topics in the study of the effects of dietary patterns on IBD and will be emerging research trends.

AB  - Context: The research field at the boundary between learning and working is multidimensional, fuzzy, dynamic, and characterized by high growth. A study that comprehensively maps and aggregates this research field is missing. Approach: Using tools of bibliometric analysis (bibliographic coupling, co-citation analysis and co-occurrence analysis), we map the research at the boundary between learning and working in a scoping review study. Our study considers peer-reviewed articles published between 2011 and 2020 and recorded in Scopus. In total, 5,474 articles are included in our analysis. Findings: Focusing on the intellectual structure of the research field, we identified the most publishing and most cited countries, journals, and authors, as well as latent collaborative networks among countries, journals, and authors. Furthermore, we used references and keywords to identify the conceptual structure of the research field and distinguished four types of conceptual clusters: motor clusters, highly developed and isolated clusters, emerging or declining clusters, and basic and transversal clusters.Conclusions: Research at the boundary between learning and working is highly parcelled out internationally. This scientific parcelling represents a disadvantage for exchanging ideas and accumulating knowledge. In addition to forming a parcelled field, a dividing line runs between centre, periphery and excluded countries and scientists. Especially scientists from developing countries and nations, economies in transition and those from post-conflict situations are excluded from the international discourse. This situation is more than just a disadvantage for the exchange of ideas and the accumulation of knowledge. Instead, there is a systematic bias in the research landscape here.

AB  - In recent times, there has been a proliferation of questionable practices in research publishing, for example, via predatory journals, hijacked journals, plagiarism, tortured phrases and paper mills. This paper intends to analyse whether journals that had been removed from the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) in 2018 due to suspected misconduct were cited within journals indexed in the Scopus database. Our analysis showed that Scopus contained over 15 thousand references to the removed journals identified. The majority of the publications citing these journals came from the area of Engineering. It is important to note that although we cannot assume that all the journals removed followed unethical practices, it is still essential that researchers are aware of the issues around citing journals that have been suspected of misconduct. We suggest that research libraries play a crucial role in training, advising and providing information to researchers about these ethical issues of publication malpractice and misconduct.

Norepinephrine (NE) is an essential component of catecholamine induced by emotional arousal, and numerous studies have demonstrated that NE is a key regulator in memory enhancement. We therefore conducted a bibliometric analysis to represent the knowledge pattern of the literature on the theme of NE-memory relationship. Methods The WOSCC database was selected to extract literature published during 2003-2022. The collected data of annual production, global cooperation, research structure and hotspots were analyzed and visualized. Results Our results showed that research on the links between NE and memory displayed a considerable development trend over the last two decades. The USA had a leading position in terms of scientific outputs and collaborations. Meanwhile, University of California Irvine contributed the most publications. Benno Roozendaal and James McGaugh were the most prolific authors in this field, and Neurobiology of Learning and Memory had the highest number of publications on this topic. The research emphasis has evolved from memory-related diseases and brain regions to neural mechanisms for different types of memory at neural circuit levels. Conclusion Our bibliometric analysis systematically analyzed the literature on the links between NE and memory from a bibliometric perspective. The demonstrated results of the knowledge mapping would provide valuable insights into the global research landscape.

AB  - The Fourth Industrial Revolution drives industries from traditional manufacturing to the smart manufacturing approach. In this transformation, existing equipment, processes, or devices are retrofitted with some sensors and other cyber-physical systems (CPS), and adapted towards digital production, which is a blend of critical enabling technologies. In the current scenario of Industry 4.0, industries are shaping themselves towards the development of customized and cost-effective processes to satisfy customer needs with the aid of a digital twin framework, which enables the user to monitor, simulate, control, optimize, and identify defects and trends within, ongoing process, and reduces the chances of human prone errors. This paper intends to make an appraisal of the literature on the digital twin (DT) framework in the domain of smart manufacturing with the aid of critical enabling technologies such as data-driven systems, machine learning and artificial intelligence, and deep learning. This paper also focuses on the concept, evolution, and background of digital twin and the benefits and challenges involved in its implementation. The Scopus and Web of Science databases from 2016 to 2021 were considered for the bibliometric analysis and used to study and analyze the articles that fall within the research theme. For the systematic bibliometric analysis, a novel approach known as Proknow-C was employed, including a series of procedures for article selection and filtration from the existing databases to get the most appropriate articles aligned with the research theme. Additionally, the authors performed statistical and network analyses on the articles within the research theme to identify the most prominent research areas, journal/conference, and authors in the field of a digital twin. This study identifies the current scenarios, possible research gaps, challenges in implementing DT, case studies and future research goals within the research theme.

AB  - Digital pathology (DIPA) has become an effective discipline that generates a graphic environment to diagnose and interpret the pathological information of people. When analyzing the existing literature on DIPA, a knowledge gap was produced by not reporting a study that has bibliometrically analyzed the publications on the subject. The objective of this study is to analyze the scientific production and performance achieved by the term digital pathology in the Web of Science (WoS) database. For this, a methodology based on bibliometrics has been carried out, complemented by the scientific mapping technique to search, recorder, analyze and predict the scientific literature on the state of question. We have worked with an analysis unit of 1222 documents reported from WoS database. The results show that there is no research topic in the field of study of DIPA that stands out from the rest. A conceptual gap can be observed in the thematic development, given that there is no theme that is repeated in all periods, where the connections are more thematic than conceptual. There are key documents for different topics. The main themes have been very different over the years like telepathology and artificial intelligence.

AB  - Classification schemes for scientific activity and publications underpin a large swath of research evaluation practices at the organizational, governmental, and national levels. Several research classifications are currently in use, and they require continuous work as new classification techniques becomes available and as new research topics emerge. Convolutional neural networks, a subset of “deep learning” approaches, have recently offered novel and highly performant methods for classifying voluminous corpora of text. This article benchmarks a deep learning classification technique on more than 40 million scientific articles and on tens of thousands of scholarly journals. The comparison is performed against bibliographic coupling-, direct citation-, and manual-based classifications—the established and most widely used approaches in the field of bibliometrics, and by extension, in many science and innovation policy activities such as grant competition management. The results reveal that the performance of this first iteration of a deep learning approach is equivalent to the graph-based bibliometric approaches. All methods presented are also on par with manual classification. Somewhat surprisingly, no machine learning approaches were found to clearly outperform the simple label propagation approach that is direct citation. In conclusion, deep learning is promising because it performed just as well as the other approaches but has more flexibility to be further improved. For example, a deep neural network incorporating information from the citation network is likely to hold the key to an even better classification algorithm.

AB  - The rising influence of artificial intelligence (AI) enables widespread adoption of the technology in every aspect of computing, including Software-Defined Networking (SDN). Technological adoption leads to the convergence of AI and SDN, producing solutions that overcome limitations present in traditional networking architecture. Although numerous review articles discuss the convergence of these technologies, there is a lack of bibliometric trace in this field, which is important for identifying trends, new niches, and future directions. Therefore, this study aims to fill the gap by presenting a thorough bibliometric analysis of AI-related SDN studies, referred to as AI-SDN. The study begins by identifying 474 unique documents in the Web of Science (WoS) database published from 2009 until recently. The study uses bibliometric analysis to identify the general information, countries, authorship, and content of the selected articles, thereby providing insights into the geographical and institutional landscape shaping AI-SDN research. The findings provide a robust roadmap for further investigation in this field, including the background and taxonomy of the AI-SDN field. Finally, the article discusses several challenges and the future of AI-SDN in academic research.

AB  - Plenty of publications had been written in the last several decades on acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in women. However, there are few bibliometric analyses in such field. In order to solve this problem, we attempted to examine the knowledge structure and development of research about AMI in women based on analysis of related publications.The Web of Science Core Collection was used to extract all publications regarding AMI in women, ranging from January 2000 to August 2022. Bibliometric analysis was performed using VOSviewer, Cite Space, and an online bibliometric analysis platform.A total of 14,853 publications related to AMI in women were identified from 2000 to 2022. Over the past 20 years, the United States had published the most articles in international research and participated in international cooperation the most frequently. The primary research institutions were Harvard University and University of Toronto. Circulation was the most cited journal and had an incontrovertible academic impact. 67,848 authors were identiﬁed, among which Harlan M Krumholz had the most signiﬁcant number of articles and Thygesen K was co-cited most often. And the most common keywords included risk factors, disease, prognosis, mortality, criteria and algorithm.The research hotspots and trends of AMI in women were identified and explored using bibliometric and visual methods. Researches about AMI in women are ﬂourishing. Criteria and algorithms might be the focus of research in the near future, which deserved great attentions.

AB  - Abstract This study’s foremost objectives were to scrutinize how unexpected weather affects agricultural output and to assess how well AI-based machine learning and deep leaning algorithms work for spotting apple leaf diseases. The researchers carried out a bibliometric study to obtain understanding of the current research trends, citation patterns, ownership and partnership arrangements, publishing patterns, and other parameters related to early identification of apple illnesses. Comprehensive interdisciplinary scientific maps are limited because syndrome recognition is not restricted to any solitary arena of research, despite the fact that there have been many studies on the identification of apple diseases. By employing a scientometric technique and 109 publications from the Scopus database published between 2011 and 2022, this study attempted to assess the condition of the research area and combine knowledge frameworks. To find important journals, authors, nations, articles, and topics, the study used the automated processes of VOSviewer and Biblioshiny software. Patterns and trends were discovered using citation counts, social network analysis, and citation and co-citation studies.

AB  - Satellite imagery is gaining popularity as a valuable tool to lower the impact on natural resources and increase profits for farmers. The purpose of this study is twofold: to mine the scientific literature to reveal the structure of this research domain, and to investigate to what extent scientific results can reach a wider public audience. To meet these two objectives, a Web of Science and a Twitter dataset were retrieved and analysed, respectively. For the academic literature, different performances of various countries were observed: the USA and China resulted as the leading actors, both in terms of published papers and employed researchers. Among the categorised keywords, “resolution”, “Landsat”, “yield”, “wheat” and “multispectral” are the most used. Then, analysing the semantic network of the words used in the various abstracts, the different facets of the research in satellite remote sensing were detected. The importance of retrieving meteorological parameters through remote sensing and the broad use of vegetation indexes emerged from these analyses. As emerging topics, classification tasks for land use assessment and crop recognition stand out, alongside the use of hyperspectral sensors. Regarding the interaction of academia with the public, the analysis showed that it is practically absent on Twitter: most of the activity therein stems from private companies advertising their business. This shows that there is still a communication gap between academia and actors from other societal sectors.

AB  - Non-motor symptoms are prevalent among individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and seriously affect patient quality of life, even more so than motor symptoms. In the past decade, an increasing number of studies have investigated non-motor symptoms in PD. The present study aimed to comprehensively analyze the global literature, trends, and hotspots of research investigating non-motor symptoms in PD through bibliometric methods. Studies addressing non-motor symptoms in the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), published between January 2013 and December 2022, were retrieved. Bibliometric methods, including the R package “Bibliometrix,” VOS viewer, and CiteSpace software, were used to investigate and visualize parameters, including yearly publications, country/region, institution, and authors, to collate and quantify information. Analysis of keywords and co-cited references explored trends and hotspots. There was a significant increase in the number of publications addressing the non-motor symptoms of PD, with a total of 3,521 articles retrieved. The United States was ranked first in terms of publications ( n = 763) and citations ( n = 11,269), maintaining its leadership position among all countries. King’s College London (United Kingdom) was the most active institution among all publications ( n = 133) and K Ray Chaudhuri was the author with the most publications ( n = 131). Parkinsonism &amp;amp; Related Disorders published the most articles, while Movement Disorders was the most cited journal. Reference explosions have shown that early diagnosis, biomarkers, novel magnetic resonance imaging techniques, and deep brain stimulation have become research “hotspots” in recent years. Keyword clustering revealed that alpha-synuclein is the largest cluster for PD. The keyword heatmap revealed that non-motor symptoms appeared most frequently ( n = 1,104), followed by quality of life ( n = 502), dementia ( n = 403), and depression ( n = 397). Results of the present study provide an objective, comprehensive, and systematic analysis of these publications, and identifies trends and “hot” developments in this field of research. This work will inform investigators worldwide to help them conduct further research and develop new therapies.

AB  - Abstract This study is the first to provide an integrated view on the body of knowledge of artificial intelligence (AI) published in the marketing, consumer research, and psychology literature. By leveraging a systematic literature review using a data‐driven approach and quantitative methodology (including bibliographic coupling), this study provides an overview of the emerging intellectual structure of AI research in the three bodies of literature examined. We identified eight topical clusters: (1) memory and computational logic; (2) decision making and cognitive processes; (3) neural networks; (4) machine learning and linguistic analysis; (5) social media and text mining; (6) social media content analytics; (7) technology acceptance and adoption; and (8) big data and robots. Furthermore, we identified a total of 412 theoretical lenses used in these studies with the most frequently used being: (1) the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology; (2) game theory; (3) theory of mind; (4) theory of planned behavior; (5) computational theories; (6) behavioral reasoning theory; (7) decision theories; and (8) evolutionary theory. Finally, we propose a research agenda to advance the scholarly debate on AI in the three literatures studied with an emphasis on cross‐fertilization of theories used across fields, and neglected research topics.

AB  - This paper presents an extensive literature review on the field of condition-based maintenance (CBM). The paper encompasses over 4000 contributions, analysed through bibliometric indicators and meta-analysis techniques. The review adopts Factor Analysis as a dimensionality reduction, concerning the metric of the co-citations of the papers. Four main research areas have been identified, able to delineate the research field synthetically, from theoretical foundations of CBM; (i) towards more specific implementation strategies (ii) and then specifically focusing on operational aspects related to (iii) inspection and replacement and (iv) prognosis. The data-driven bibliometric results have been combined with an interpretative research to extract both core and detailed concepts related to CBM. This combined analysis allows a critical reflection on the field and the extraction of potential future research directions.

AB  - The growing interest suggests that the widespread application of radiomics has facilitated the development of neurological disease diagnosis, prognosis, and classification. The application of artificial intelligence methods in radiomics has increasingly achieved outstanding prediction results in recent years. However, there are few studies that have systematically analyzed this field through bibliometrics. Our destination is to study the visual relationships of publications to identify the trends and hotspots in radiomics research and encourage more researchers to participate in radiomics studies.Publications in radiomics in the field of neurological disease research can be retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. Analysis of relevant countries, institutions, journals, authors, keywords, and references is conducted using Microsoft Excel 2019, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace V. We analyze the research status and hot trends through burst detection.On October 23, 2022, 746 records of studies on the application of radiomics in the diagnosis of neurological disorders were retrieved and published from 2011 to 2023. Approximately half of them were written by scholars in the United States, and most were published in Frontiers in Oncology, European Radiology, Cancer, and SCIENTIFIC REPORTS. Although China ranks first in the number of publications, the United States is the driving force in the field and enjoys a good academic reputation. NORBERT GALLDIKS and JIE TIAN published the most relevant articles, while GILLIES RJ was cited the most. RADIOLOGY is a representative and influential journal in the field. "Glioma" is a current attractive research hotspot. Keywords such as "machine learning," "brain metastasis," and "gene mutations" have recently appeared at the research frontier.Most of the studies focus on clinical trial outcomes, such as the diagnosis, prediction, and prognosis of neurological disorders. The radiomics biomarkers and multi-omics studies of neurological disorders may soon become a hot topic and should be closely monitored, particularly the relationship between tumor-related non-invasive imaging biomarkers and the intrinsic micro-environment of tumors.

AB  - Prognostics and health management (PHM) plays a constructive role in the equipment’s entire life health service. It has long benefited from intensive research into physics modeling and machine learning methods. However, in practice, the existing solutions often encounter difficulties caused by sparse data & incomplete system failure knowledge. Pure machine learning or physics-based methods can sometimes be infeasible in such situations. As a result, there has been a growing interest in developing physics-informed machine learning (PIML) models which allow incorporating different forms of physics knowledge at different positions of the machine learning pipeline. This combination provides significant assistance for detection, diagnostic, and prognostics. However, to the best of our knowledge, the bibliometrics analyses and the comprehensive review of the existing research concerning PIML in PHM remain vacant. Our review is therefore dedicated to filling these gaps. We synthesize the concept of PIML in PHM, and propose a taxonomy of PIML approaches from the perspective of “Expression forms of informed knowledge” and “Knowledge informed methods”. The findings and discussions presented in this paper enable us to clarify the current state of the art and the emerging opportunities of PIML approaches, especially for building PHM systems that can work under the “small data and scarce physics knowledge” paradigm.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly adopted by organizations to innovate, and this is ever more reflected in scholarly work. To illustrate, assess and map research at the intersection of AI and innovation, we performed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of published work indexed in the Clarivate Web of Science (WOS) and Elsevier Scopus databases (the final sample includes 1448 articles). A bibliometric analysis was deployed to map the focal field in terms of dominant topics and their evolution over time. By deploying keyword co-occurrences, and bibliographic coupling techniques, we generate insights on the literature at the intersection of AI and innovation research. We leverage the SLR findings to provide an updated synopsis of extant scientific work on the focal research area and to develop an interpretive framework which sheds light on the drivers and outcomes of AI adoption for innovation. We identify economic, technological, and social factors of AI adoption in firms willing to innovate. We also uncover firms' economic, competitive and organizational, and innovation factors as key outcomes of AI deployment. We conclude this paper by developing an agenda for future research.

AB  - Abstract Research regarding microbial fuel cells has been stimulated to reduce the operating costs and energy consumption of conventional wastewater treatment, and increase its profitability. However, these devices are challenging to study due to their complexity and sensitivity to both internal and external factors. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used to analyze microbial fuel cells as an effective alternative to the use of mathematical models, which are still in development. In this study, the main goals were to perform the first bibliometric analysis of AI applied to microbial fuel cell research and to find the most popular algorithms used to date. Using the Web of Science database, a total of 102 articles published between 1999 and 2022 were retrieved. The cumulative number of articles has greatly increased over the past 10 years. About 55% were contributed by researchers from China and USA, leading among 20 countries. Some 50 algorithms were used, with principal component analysis and feed-forward neural networks being the most popular used to study and optimize microbial fuel cells.

AB  - COVID-19 has been an unprecedented challenge that disruptively reshaped societies and brought a massive amount of novel knowledge to the scientific community. However, as this knowledge flood continues surging, researchers have been disadvantaged by not having access to a platform that can quickly synthesize emerging information and link the new knowledge to the latent knowledge foundation. Aiming to fill this gap, we propose a research framework and develop a dashboard that can assist scientists in identifying, retrieving, and understanding COVID-19 knowledge from the ocean of scholarly articles. Incorporating principal component decomposition (PCD), a knowledge mode-based search approach, and hierarchical topic tree (HTT) analysis, the proposed framework profiles the COVID-19 research landscape, retrieves topic-specific latent knowledge foundation, and visualizes knowledge structures. The regularly updated dashboard presents our research results. Addressing 127,971 COVID-19 research papers from PubMed, the PCD topic analysis identifies 35 research hotspots, along with their inner correlations and fluctuating trends. The HTT result segments the global knowledge landscape of COVID-19 into clinical and public health branches and reveals the deeper exploration of those studies. To supplement this analysis, we additionally built a knowledge model from research papers on the topic of vaccination and fetched 92,286 pre-Covid publications as the latent knowledge foundation for reference. The HTT analysis results on the retrieved papers show multiple relevant biomedical disciplines and four future research topics: monoclonal antibody treatments, vaccinations in diabetic patients, vaccine immunity effectiveness and durability, and vaccination-related allergic sensitization.

AB  - The therapeutic potential of proton therapy (PT) was first recognized in 1946 by Robert Wilson, and nowadays, over 100 proton centers are in operation worldwide, and more than 60 are under construction or planned. Bibliometric data can be used to perform a structured analysis of large amounts of scientific data to provide new insights, e.g., to assess the growth and development of the field and to identify research trends and hot topics. The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the current status and trends in scientific literature in the PT field.The literature on PT until the 31st December 2022 in the Scopus database was searched, including the following keywords: proton AND radiotherapy AND cancer/tumor in title, abstract, and/or keywords. The open-source R Studio's Bibliometrix package and Biblioshiny software (version 2.0) were used to perform the analysis.A total of 7335 documents, mainly articles (n = 4794, 65%) and reviews (n = 1527, 21%), were collected from 1946 to 2022 from 1054 sources and 21,696 authors. Of these, roughly 84% (n = 6167) were produced in the last 15 years (2008-2022), in which the mean annual growth rate was 13%. Considering the corresponding author's country, 79 countries contributed to the literature; the USA was the top contributor, with 2765 (38%) documents, of whom 84% were single-country publications (SCP), followed by Germany and Japan, with 535 and 531 documents of whom 66% and 93% were SCP. Considering the themes subanalysis (2002-2022), a total of 7192 documents were analyzed; among all keywords used by authors, the top three were radiotherapy (n = 1394, 21% of documents), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (n = 301, 5%), and prostate cancer (n = 301, 5%). Among disease types, prostate cancer is followed by chordoma, head and neck, and breast cancer. The change in trend themes demonstrated the fast evolution of hotspots in PT; among the most recent trends, the appearance of flash, radiomics, relative biological effectiveness (RBE), and linear energy transfer (LET) deserve to be highlighted.The results of the present bibliometric analysis showed that PT is an active and rapidly increasing field of research. Themes of the published works encompass the main aspects of its application in clinical practice, such as the comparison with the actual photon-based standard of care technique and the continuing technological advances. This analysis gives an overview of past scientific production and, most importantly, provides a useful point of view on the future directions of the research activities.

AB  - In the last decade, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and learning data analytics have been introduced with great effect in the field of higher education. However, despite the potential benefits for higher education institutions (HIE´s) of these emerging technologies, most of them are still in the early stages of adoption of these technologies. Thus, a systematic literature review (SLR) on the literature published over the last 5 years on potential applications of machine learning in higher education is necessary. Following the PRISMA guidelines, out of the 1887 initially identified SCOPUS-indexed publications on the topic, 171 articles were selected for review. To screen the abstracts and titles of each citation, Rayyan QCRI was used. VOSViewer, a software tool for constructing and visualizing bibliometric networks, and Microsoft Excel were used to generate charts and figures. The findings show that the most widely researched application of ML in higher education is related to the prediction of academic performance and employability of students. The implications will be invaluable for researchers and practitioners to explore how ML and AI technologies ,in the era of ChatGPT, can be used in universities without jeopardizing academic integrity.

AB  - Abstract Acupuncture has been widely used in stroke and post-stroke rehabilitation (PSR), but there is no literature on the bibliometric analysis of acupuncture for stroke. This study aimed to characterize the global publications and analyze the trends of acupuncture for stroke in the past 40 years. We identified 1157 publications from the Web of Science Core Collection. The number of publications grew slowly in the first three decades from 1980 until it started to grow after 2010, with significant growth in 2011–2012 and 2019–2020. China, the USA, and South Korea are the top three countries in this field, and China has formed good internal cooperative relations. Early studies focused on the clinical efficacy of acupuncture for stroke. In the last five years, more emphasis has been placed on the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating sequelae and complications, combined with neuroimaging studies to explore the mechanisms of brain injury repair and neurological recovery. Acupuncture for stroke has a vast research potential, and researchers from different countries/regions and organizations still need to remove academic barriers to enhance communication and collaboration.

This research presents a bibliometric analysis of the literature on urban stormwater management optimization from 2004 to 2023, with the aim of understanding how the field has responded to these escalating challenges. Aiming to map the evolution and current state of the field, this study employed a methodical approach, using CiteSpace to analyze publication trends, authorship patterns, and geographical distributions, as well as keyword and citation dynamics. The findings reveal a marked increase in research activity after 2014, with significant contributions observed between 2019 and 2022. Key research themes identified include low-impact development, green infrastructure, and stormwater management, with a notable shift towards hybrid grey–green infrastructure solutions that combine traditional and ecological elements. The prevalence of terms such as ‘best management practices’ and ‘Green Roofs’ in recent publications indicates a growing emphasis on practical, case-study-based research, particularly in green infrastructure technologies like bioretention cells. These insights underscore the field’s movement towards pragmatic, multi-objective optimization frameworks with tangible applications, guiding future research directions in this increasingly complex domain.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising field in cardiovascular disease (CVD) research, offering innovative approaches to enhance diagnosis, treatment, and patient outcomes. In this study, we conducted bibliometric analysis combined with topic modeling to provide a comprehensive overview of the AI research landscape in CVD. Our analysis included 23,846 studies from Web of Science and PubMed, capturing the latest advancements and trends in this rapidly evolving field. By employing LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) we identified key research themes, trends, and collaborations within the AI-CVD domain. The findings revealed the exponential growth of AI-related research in CVD, underscoring its immense potential to revolutionize cardiovascular healthcare. The annual scientific publication of machine learning papers in CVD increases continuously and significantly since 2016, with an overall annual growth rate of 22.8%. Almost half (46.2%) of the growth happened in the last 5 years. USA, China, India, UK and Korea were the top five productive countries in number of publications. UK, Germany and Australia were the most collaborative countries with a multiple country publication (MCP) value of 42.8%, 40.3% and 40.0% respectively. We observed the emergence of twenty-two distinct research topics, including “stroke and robotic rehabilitation therapy,” “robotic-assisted cardiac surgery,” and “cardiac image analysis,” which persisted as major topics throughout the years. Other topics, such as “retinal image analysis and CVD” and “biomarker and wearable signal analyses,” have recently emerged as dominant areas of research in cardiovascular medicine. Convolutional neural network appears to be the most mentioned algorithm followed by LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours). This indicates that the future direction of AI cardiovascular research is predominantly directing toward neural networks and image analysis. As AI continues to shape the landscape of CVD research, our study serves as a comprehensive guide for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, providing valuable insights into the current state of AI in CVD research. This study offers a deep understanding of research trends and paves the way for future directions to maximiz the potential of AI to effectively combat cardiovascular diseases.

AB  - Introduction As a vital component within glacier systems, the occurrences of glacial lake disasters in high mountain regions have progressively emerged as one of the most destructive natural calamities amid the backdrop of global warming. The swift advancement of glacial lake identification techniques offers a pivotal perspective for forecasting and mitigating the perils of glacial lake outburst disasters. Methods To evaluate the thematic evolution, research focal points, and forthcoming directions within the glacier identification domain, a comprehensive bibliometric analysis was conducted on glacial lake identification-related literature from 1991 to 2023 in the Web of Science Core Collection database. Results 1) The United States, the United Kingdom, and China stand as principal nations propelling the field's advancement. The Chinese Academy of Sciences demonstrates the highest activity in terms of article publications and international collaborations. 2) Climate change, compilation of glacial lake inventories, methodologies for risk assessment, glacial lake outburst floods, comprehensive disaster management strategies, and hydrodynamic models constitute the domain's research hotspots. It is a typical multidisciplinary field. 3) Persistently high-impact topics over an extended period include “hazard”, “Late Pleistocene”, “environmental change”, “ice sheet”, and “lake sediments”. Keywords indicating the present cutting-edge research encompass “inventory”, “glacial lake outburst flood”, “risk”, “dynamics”, “Tibetan Plateau”, “evolution”, and “high mountain Asia”. Discussion This paper delves into the current status and pivotal concerns of glacial lake identification techniques, methodologies, and the scale of identification research themes. Further Research should concentrate on avenues like “recognition methods grounded in machine learning and deep learning”, “multisource data fusion datasets”, “novel algorithms and technologies adaptable to scale transformation and data expansion”, as well as “enhancing spatiotemporal data resolution”. This will ultimately enable precise, prolonged, and multiscalar identification of glacial lakes. his study provides valuable guidance and reference for future research in the field of glacial lake identification.

AB  - Quantitatively measuring the impact-related aspects of scientific, engineering, and technological (SET) innovations is a fundamental problem with broad applications. Traditional citation-based measures for assessing the impact of innovations and related entities do not take into account the content of the publications. This limits their ability to provide rigorous quality-related metrics because they cannot account for the reasons that led to a citation. We present approaches to estimate content-aware bibliometrics to quantitatively measure the scholarly impact of a publication. Our approaches assess the impact of a cited publication by the extent to which the cited publication informs the citing publication. We introduce a new metric, called “Content Informed Index” (CII), that uses the content of the paper as a source of distant-supervision, to quantify how much the cited-node informs the citing-node. We evaluate the weights estimated by our approach on three manually annotated datasets, where the annotations quantify the extent of information in the citation. Particularly, we evaluate how well the ranking imposed by our approach associates with the ranking imposed by the manual annotations. CII achieves up to 103% improvement in performance as compared to the second-best performing approach.

AB  - Urban areas, with their dense populations and complex infrastructures, are increasingly susceptible to various risks, including environmental challenges and infrastructural strain. This paper delves into the transformative potential of digital twins—virtual replicas of physical entities—for mitigating these risks. It specifically explores the role of digital twins in reducing disaster risks, such as those posed by earthquakes and floods, through a comprehensive bibliometric-based literature review. Digital twins could contribute to risk reduction by combining data analytics, simulation, and predictive modeling by creating virtual replicas of physical entities and integrating real-time data streams to better address and manage risks in urban environments. In detail, they can help city planners and decision-makers analyze complex urban systems, simulate potential scenarios, and predict potential outcomes. This proactive approach allows both the identification of vulnerabilities and better implementation of targeted mitigation strategies to enhance urban resilience and sustainability. More informed decisions can be made relying on simulations, and it can also be possible to optimize resource allocation and better respond to emerging challenges. This work reviews the key publications in this domain, with the aim of finding relevant papers that can be useful to urban planners and policy-makers. The paper concludes by discussing the broader implications of these findings and identifying challenges in the widespread adoption of digital twin technology, including data privacy concerns and the need for interdisciplinary collaboration. It also outlines prospective avenues for future research in this emerging field.

AB  - With the significant role that Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) could play in industry, the military and the transformation of ocean engineering, a growing research interest in USVs is attracted to their innovation, new technology and automation. Yet, there has been no comprehensive review grounded in bibliometric analysis, which concentrates on the most recent technological advancements and developments in USVs. To provide deeper insight into the relevant research trends, this study employs a bibliometric analysis to examine the basic features of the literature from 2000 to 2023, and identifies the key research hotspots and modeling techniques by reviewing their current statuses and the recent efforts made in these areas. Based on the analysis of the temporal and spatial trends, disciplines and journals’ distribution, institutions, authors and citations, the publications relating to the new technology of USVs are assessed based on their keywords and the term analysis in the literature; six future research directions are proposed, including enhanced intelligence and autonomy, highly integrated sensor systems and multi-modal task execution, extended endurance and resilience, satellite communication and interconnectivity, eco-friendly and sustainable practices and safety and defense. The scientific literature is reviewed in a systematic way using a comparative analysis of existing tools, and the results greatly contribute to understanding the overall situation of new technology in USVs. This paper is enlightening to students, international scholars and institutions, as it can facilitate partnerships between industry and academia to allow for concerted efforts to be made in the domain of USVs.

AB  - Tourism is a sector of high relevance worldwide, due to the multiple impacts it generates in local, regional, national, continental, and global economies, and it is a key generator of employment and provides sustenance to an innumerable number of people around the world. There have been many challenges at a global level to improve the user experience in a particular tourist place, where technology has played a highly relevant role in strengthening the conditions for tourists to achieve immersion in the culture, gastronomy, and recreation. The objective of this literature review is precisely to know and understand the key contributions that are currently being developed around the implementation of augmented reality as tourist technological support for user experiences. The literature on this topic is quite dispersed in specialized databases; therefore, it constitutes an opportunity to carry out a more detailed exploration of the topic. To address the different developments that have been carried out on tourism and augmented reality, an analysis was carried out based on the fusion of scientometric analysis and the metaphor of the Tree of Science, in which two relevant visions about the data were generated. The first focused on the different scientometric statistics regarding countries, authors, universities, or research or technological development centers that currently generate new applications based on augmented reality for tourism. The second focused on an evolutionary analysis based on the Tree of Science, analyzing the origins of the basic contributions of research and how it has evolved over time. This review indicates that the topic is currently valid and that it has been strengthened even more with the post-pandemic process, where many technological developments have been strengthened that allow people to enjoy tourist and cultural sites even without leaving home.

AB  - Abstract The goal of this study is to comprehensively analyze the dynamics and structure of TikTok research since its initial development. The scholarly composition of articles dealing with TikTok was dissected via a bibliometric study based on a corpus of 542 journal articles from the Scopus database. The results show that TikTok research has flourished in recent years and also demonstrate that the authors’ collaboration networks are disjointed, indicating a lack of cooperation among TikTok researchers. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that research collaboration among academic institutions reflects the North-South divide, also highlighting a limited research collaboration between institutions in developed and developing countries. Based on the keyword co-occurrence network and topic modeling, TikTok research revolves mainly around five thematic areas, including public health, health communication and education, platform governance, body image, and its impact on children and students. Based on these findings, numerous suggestions for further research are offered. As far as the authors are aware, this is the first application of bibliometrics and topic modeling to assess the growth of TikTok research and reveal the intellectual base of this knowledge domain.

AB  - At present, the development of the global manufacturing industry is still in the transition stage from Industry 3.0 to Industry 4.0 (i.e., Industry 3.X), and the production logistics system is becoming more and more complex due to the individualization of customer demands and the high frequency of order changes. In order to systematically analyze the research status and dynamic evolution trend of production logistics in the Industry 3.X stage, this paper designed a Log-Likelihood ratio-based latent Dirichlet allocation (LLR-LDA) algorithm based on bibliometrics and knowledge graph technology, taking the literature of China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Web of Science database as the data source. In-depth bibliometric analysis of literature was carried out from research progress, hotspot evolution, and frontier trends. At the same time, taking the case of scientific research projects overcome by our research group as an example, it briefly introduced the synchronized decision-making framework of digital twin-enabled production logistics system. It is expected to broaden the research boundary of production logistics in the Industry 3.X stage, promote the development and progress of the industry, and provide valuable reference for steadily moving towards the Industry 4.0 stage.

Then the paper records that contained the key technology lexicon were filtered out. Next, the annual number of publications and the distribution of key technologies over time were counted. The least squares method was used to fit the distribution of the annual proportion of the publications, and the slope k1 of the fitted linear regression equation was used to determine the research interest trend of key technologies. The key technologies were divided into “hot technology,” “cold technology,” and “other technologies,” according to the research heat trend. In order to further explore the research hotspots, the least squares method was also used to fit the citations of all technologies to obtain the slope k2. We use the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) algorithm to cluster k1 and k2 of each technology. As a result, the 144 technologies were divided into 13 super-key technologies, 60 key technologies, 59 relative key technologies, and 12 lower-key technologies. Then, the evolution of key technologies was analyzed from two perspectives of weighted evolution and cumulative evolution. And the technology evolution trend in the transportation field in the past 20 years was explored. Finally, the cooccurrence clustering method was adopted to divide key transportation technologies into five categories: vehicle technology and control, optimization algorithms and simulation techniques, artificial intelligence and big data, Internet of Things and computing, and communication technology. The research results can provide references for different people in the transportation field, including but not limited to researchers, journal editors, and funding agencies.

AB  - Non-fasting lipid assessment can help predict cardiovascular disease risks and is linked to multiple diseases, particularly diabetes. The significance of non-fasting lipid levels in routine screening and postprandial lipid tests for potential dyslipidemia has not been conclusively determined. Various new lipid-lowering strategies have been developed to improve non-fasting dyslipidemia. Therefore, analysis of scientific outputs over the past decade is essential to reveal trends, hotspots, and frontier areas for future research in this field.The Science Citation Index Expanded in the Web of Science Core Collection database was searched for publications related to non-fasting lipid research from 2012 to 2022. The regional distributions, authors, disciplines, journals, references, and keywords of the studies were analyzed using the bibliometric software VOSviewer and CiteSpace.A total of 4160 articles and reviews that met the inclusion criteria were included in this study. The output trend was established to be stable and the number of citation indices has been persistently increasing. A total of 104 countries/regions, 4668 organizations, and 20782 authors were involved in this research area. In terms of country, the United States had the largest number of publications (979). The University of Copenhagen was the most productive institution, publishing 148 papers. Professor Børge G Nordestgaard has made the most significant contribution to this field. Nutrients was the most productive journal while the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition was the highest co-cited journal. Analysis of co-cited references indicated that lipid-lowering strategies, statin therapy, high-fat meals, insulin resistance, physical exercise, and fructose were hotspots. Analysis of co-cited keywords revealed that apolipoprotein B, especially apolipoprotein B48, is becoming a key research focus. The keywords "gut microbiota" and "meal timing" were the most extensively studied.The causal relationship between non-fasting dyslipidemia and diseases is currently being explored and the standards for non-fasting or postprandial lipid assessment are continuously being updated. Among the hotspots, lipid-lowering strategies are a potential research direction. Apolipoprotein B48, gut microbiota, and chrononutrition are the research frontiers. This initial bibliometric analysis of non-fasting lipids will enable researchers to monitor swift transformations and recognize novel concepts for upcoming research.

AB  - Software development effort and cost estimation (SDECE) is one of the most important tasks in the field of software engineering. A large number of research papers have been published on this topic in the last five decades. Investigating research trends using a systematic literature review when such a large number of research papers are published is a very tedious and time-consuming task. Therefore, in this research paper, we propose a generic automated text mining framework to investigate research trends by analyzing the title, author’s keywords, and abstract of the research papers. The proposed framework is used to investigate research trends by analyzing the title, keywords, and abstract of select 1015 research papers published on SDECE in the last five decades. We have identified the most popular SDECE techniques in each decade to understand how SDECE has evolved in the past five decades. It is found that artificial neural network, fuzzy logic, regression, analogy-based approach, and COCOMO methods are the most used techniques for SDECE followed by optimization, use case point, machine learning, and function point analysis. The NASA and ISBSG are the most used dataset for SDECE. The MMRE, MRE, and PRED are the most used accuracy measures for SDECE. Results of the proposed framework are validated by comparing it with the outcome of the previously published review work and we found that the results are consistent. We have also carried out a detailed bibliometric analysis and metareview of the review and survey papers published on SDECE. This research study is significant for the development of new models for cost and effort estimations.

AB  - COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by World Health Organization in March 2020. Since then, it has attracted the enormous attention of researchers from around the world. The world has gone through previous instances of corona-viruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome. Nevertheless, none was of these were of this serious nature as COVID-19. In this research, we carry out a bibliometric analysis of coronavirus research using the Scopus database. However, we restricted ourselves to the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, comprising Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The analysis was performed using Biblioshiny software. We analyzed 4288 articles written by 24226 researchers from 1994 till 2021, published in 1429 sources. The number of authors per publication is 5.65. A bulk of the research (more than 68%) appeared in the form of articles. More than 43% of the publications appeared in 2020 and more than 44% in 2021. Saudi Arabia appears the most-cited country, followed by Qatar. Journal of Infection and Public Health published the most number of papers, whereas New England Journal of Medicine is the most-cited one. Memish, Z.A. wrote the maximum number of papers. The top source, according to the H-index, is the Journal of Virology. Furthermore, the two most prolific universities are King Saud University and King Abdulaziz University, both from Saudi Arabia. The research uncovered deep learning as a niche theme used in recent publications. The research landscape continues to alter as the pandemic keeps on evolving.

AB  - Land subsidence is one of the serious natural disasters which can cause heavy casualties and economic losses. As a vital method, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) can provide quick and efficient solutions for analysis. Currently, most reviews on InSAR application in land subsidence only focused on single types of land areas, such as the land around groundwater and land of the mining area. There is a lack of discussion on all types of land areas. This study thus aims at conducting a bibliometric literature analysis of the existing literature from 2000 to 2021 to fill this gap. The authors used scientific mapping methods to analyze the InSAR applications in land subsidence so that researchers and practitioners can comprehend the procedure. Then, the authors identified the major research areas, development milestones, evolutionary stages, and the transaction dynamics of evolutionary stages. Knowledge maps of five aspects were applied and analyzed in this research, including temporal development analysis, countries and institutions, major research disciplines, high-frequency terms, and cocitation of high-citation papers. The results reveal that the research of land subsidence monitoring with InSAR is in the stage of diffusion from developing many tools and techniques to integrating with other research areas. Overall, the bibliometric results combined with evolutionary stages provide a holistic picture of the status quo and future trends in InSAR application in land subsidence.

AB  - The rise of stakeholder interest globally in sustainable business practices has resulted in a rise in demands from stakeholders that companies report on the environmental and social impacts of their business activities. In certain cases, however, companies have resorted to the practice of providing inaccurate disclosures regarding sustainability as part of their corporate communications and sustainability reporting—commonly referred to as “greenwashing”. Concurrently, technological improvements in artificial intelligence have presented the means to rapidly and accurately analyze large volumes of text-based information, such as that contained in sustainability reports. Despite the possible impacts of artificial intelligence and machine learning on the fields of greenwashing and sustainability reporting, no literature to date has comprehensively and holistically addressed the interrelationship between these three important topics. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by using bibliometric and thematic analyses to systematically analyze the interrelationship between those fields. The analysis is also used to conjecture a conceptual and thematic framework for the use of artificial intelligence with machine learning in relation to greenwashing and company sustainability reporting. This paper finds that the use of artificial intelligence in relation to greenwashing, and greenwashing within sustainability reporting, is an underexplored research field.

AB  - This paper analyses and reports various types of published works related to classification or discriminant modelling. This paper adopted a bibliometric analysis based on the data obtained from the Scopus online database on 27th July 2019. Based on the 'keywords' search results, it yielded 2775 valid documents for further analysis. For data visualisation purposes, we employed VOSviewer. This paper reports the results using standard bibliometric indicators, particularly on the growth rate of publications, research productivity, analysis of the authors and citations. The outcomes revealed that there is an increased growth rate of classification literature over the years since 1968. A total of 2473 (89.12%) documents were from journals (n=1439; 51.86%) and conference proceedings (n=1034; 37.26%) contributed as the top publications in this classification topic. Meanwhile, 2578 (92.9%) documents are multi-authored with an average collaboration index of 3.34 authors per article. However, this classification research field found that the famous numbers of authors' collaboration in a document are two (with n=758; 27.32%), three (n=752; 27.10%) and four (n=560; 20.18%) respectively. An analysis by country, China with 1146 (41.30%) published documents thus is ranked first in productivity. With respect to the frequency of citations, Bauer and Kohavi (1999)'s article emerged as the most cited article through 1414 total citations with an average of 70.7 citations per year. Overall, the increasing number of works on classification topics indicates a growing awareness of its importance and specific requirements in this research field.

AB  - This paper aims to examine the publication metrics of literature related to the influential aspects of ESG (environmental, social, and governance), SRI (socially responsible investing), ethical, and impact investing on the portfolio and financial performance literature. It also seeks to identify major patterns and core themes in this topic and draw lessons from the past literature for future directions. Data from the SCOPUS database were used in this study. The ‘biblioshiny’ R package, also known as ‘bibliometrix 3.0’, was employed to conduct bibliometric analysis, utilising mapping and clustering techniques on 260 articles, in order to distil the comprehensive knowledge and identify emerging trends in ESG, SRI, ethical, and impact investing. The thematic map classified the ESG, SRI, ethical, impact investing and performance relationship themes into four categories of themes: niche themes (SRI, engagement and ESG), motor themes (corporate financial performance, corporate social performance, ESG, ESG factors, sustainability, performance, integrated reporting, gender diversity, and board size), emerging or declining themes (social responsibility, environmental performance, socially responsible investment, ethical investment, and SRI), and basic or transversal themes (financial performance, corporate social performance, ESG performance, environmental, social, and governance). Socially responsible investing, engagement, and ESG imply a position between niche themes and a highly developed topic/emerging or a decreasing theme, while the impact of COVID-19 on sustainability and financial performance implies a position between a highly developed topic/emerging or decreasing theme and a basic theme. The findings contribute to the enhanced understanding of ESG, SRI, ethical, impact investing and performance, which are crucial for an efficient capital market in promoting sustainability and sustainable development. The study offers vital practical implications and future research directions.

AB  - Multiple studies have investigated bibliometric factors predictive of the citation count a research article will receive. In this article, we go beyond bibliometric data by using a range of machine learning techniques to find patterns predictive of citation count using both article content and available metadata. As the input collection, we use the CORD-19 corpus containing research articles-mostly from biology and medicine-applicable to the COVID-19 crisis. Our study employs a combination of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for text understanding, including embeddings-based language model BERT, several systems for detection and semantic expansion of entities: ConceptNet, Pubtator and ScispaCy. To interpret the resulting models, we use several explanation algorithms: random forest feature importance, LIME, and Shapley values. We compare the performance and comprehensibility of models obtained by "black-box" machine learning algorithms (neural networks and random forests) with models built with rule learning (CORELS, CBA), which are intrinsically explainable. Multiple rules were discovered, which referred to biomedical entities of potential interest. Of the rules with the highest lift measure, several rules pointed to dipeptidyl peptidase4 (DPP4), a known MERS-CoV receptor and a critical determinant of camel to human transmission of the camel coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Some other interesting patterns related to the type of animal investigated were found. Articles referring to bats and camels tend to draw citations, while articles referring to most other animal species related to coronavirus are lowly cited. Bat coronavirus is the only other virus from a non-human species in the betaB clade along with the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. MERS-CoV is in a sister betaC clade, also close to human SARS coronaviruses. Thus both species linked to high citation counts harbor coronaviruses which are more phylogenetically similar to human SARS viruses. On the other hand, feline (FIPV, FCOV) and canine coronaviruses (CCOV) are in the alpha coronavirus clade and more distant from the betaB clade with human SARS viruses. Other results include detection of apparent citation bias favouring authors with western sounding names. Equal performance of TF-IDF weights and binary word incidence matrix was observed, with the latter resulting in better interpretability. The best predictive performance was obtained with a "black-box" method-neural network. The rule-based models led to most insights, especially when coupled with text representation using semantic entity detection methods. Follow-up work should focus on the analysis of citation patterns in the context of phylogenetic trees, as well on patterns referring to DPP4, which is currently considered as a SARS-Cov-2 therapeutic target.

AB  - Interoperability is playing an increasing role for today’s logistics and supply chain management (LSCM) because of the trends of cooperation or coopetition. Especially, digital interoperability concerning data or information exchange becomes a key enabler for the next evolutions that will massively rely upon digitalization, artificial intelligence, and autonomous systems. The notion of Physical Internet (PI) is one such evolution, an innovative worldwide logistic paradigm aimed at interconnecting and coordinating logistics networks for efficiency and sustainability. This paper investigates how digital interoperability can help interconnect logistics and supply networks as well as the operational solutions for sustainable development, and examines the new challenges and research opportunities for digital interoperability under the PI paradigm. To this end, we study the most relevant technologies for digital interoperability in LSCM, via a bibliometric analysis based on 208 papers published during 2010−2020. The results reveal that the present state-of-the-art solutions of digital interoperability are not fully aligned with PI requirements and show new challenges, research gaps and opportunities that need further discussion. Accordingly, several research avenues are suggested to advance research and applications in this area, and to achieve interconnection in logistics and supply networks for sustainability.

AB  - The continuous increase in the volume of geospatial data has led to the creation of storage tools and the cloud to process data. Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud-based platform that facilitates geoprocessing, making it a tool of great interest to the academic and research world. This article proposes a bibliometric analysis of the GEE platform to analyze its scientific production. The methodology consists of four phases. The first phase corresponds to selecting “search” criteria, followed by the second phase focused on collecting data during the 2011 and 2022 periods using Elsevier’s Scopus database. Software and bibliometrics allowed to review the published articles during the third phase. Finally, the results were analyzed and interpreted in the last phase. The research found 2800 documents that received contributions from 125 countries, with China and the USA leading as the countries with higher contributions supporting an increment in the use of GEE for the visualization and processing of geospatial data. The intellectual structure study and knowledge mapping showed that topics of interest included satellites, sensors, remote sensing, machine learning, land use and land cover. The co-citations analysis revealed the connection between the researchers who used the GEE platform in their research papers. GEE has proven to be an emergent web platform with the potential to manage big satellite data easily. Furthermore, GEE is considered a multidisciplinary tool with multiple applications in various areas of knowledge. This research adds to the current knowledge about the Google Earth Engine platform, analyzing its cognitive structure related to the research in the Scopus database. In addition, this study presents inferences and suggestions to develop future works with this methodology.

AB  - E-mental healthcare is the convergence of digital technologies with mental health services. It has been developed to fill a gap in healthcare for people who need mental wellbeing support that may not otherwise receive psychological treatment. With an increasing number of e-mental healthcare and research, this study aimed to investigate the trends of an e-mental health research field that integrates interdisciplinary fields and to examine the information technologies is being used in mental healthcare. To achieve the research objectives, bibliometric analysis, information extraction, and network analysis were applied to analyze e-mental health research data.E-mental health research data were obtained from 3663 bibliographic records from the Web of Science (WoS) and 3172 full-text articles from PubMed Central (PMC). The text mining techniques used for this study included bibliometric analysis, information extraction, and visualization.The e-mental health research topic trends primarily involved e-health care services and medical informatics research. The clusters of research comprised 16 clusters, which refer to mental sickness, e-health, diseases, information technology (IT), and self-management. The information extraction analysis revealed a triple relation with IT and biomedical domains. Betweenness centrality was used as a measure of network graph centrality, based on the shortest path to rank the important entities and triple relation; nodes with higher betweenness centrality had greater control over the network because more information passes through that node. The IT entity-relations of "mobile" had the highest score at 0.043466. The top pairs were related to depression, mobile health, and text message.E-mental related publications were associated with various research fields, such as nursing, psychology, medical informatics, computer science, telecommunication, and healthcare innovation. We found that trends in e-mental health research are continually rising. These trends were related to the internet of things (IoT) and mobile applications (Apps), which were applied for mental healthcare services. Moreover, producing AI and machine learning for e-mental healthcare were being studied. This work supports the appropriate approaches and methods of e-mental health research that can help the researcher to identify important themes and choose the best fit with their own survey work.

AB  - Purpose Regulatory initiatives and related technological shifts have been imposing restrictions on data-driven marketing (DDM) practices. This paper aims to find the main restrictions for DDM and the key management theories applied to investigate the consequences of these restrictions. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a unified bibliometric analysis with 104 publications retrieved from both Scopus and Web of Science, followed by a qualitative, in-depth systematic literature review to identify the management theories in literature and inform a research agenda. Findings The fragmentation of the research outcomes was overcome by the identification of 3 main clusters and 11 management theories that structured 18 questions for future research. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper sets for the first time a frontier between almost three decades where DDM evolved with no significative restrictions, grounded on innovations and market autoregulation, and an era where data privacy, anti-trust and competition and data sovereignty regulations converge to impose structural changes, requiring scholars and practitioners to rethink the roles of data at the strategic level of the firm.

AB  - Background The utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in the biomedical field has attracted increasing attention in recent decades. Studying how past AI technologies have found their way into medicine over time can help to predict which current (and future) AI technologies have the potential to be utilized in medicine in the coming years, thereby providing a helpful reference for future research directions. Objective The aim of this study was to predict the future trend of AI technologies used in different biomedical domains based on past trends of related technologies and biomedical domains. Methods We collected a large corpus of articles from the PubMed database pertaining to the intersection of AI and biomedicine. Initially, we attempted to use regression on the extracted keywords alone; however, we found that this approach did not provide sufficient information. Therefore, we propose a method called “background-enhanced prediction” to expand the knowledge utilized by the regression algorithm by incorporating both the keywords and their surrounding context. This method of data construction resulted in improved performance across the six regression models evaluated. Our findings were confirmed through experiments on recurrent prediction and forecasting. Results In our analysis using background information for prediction, we found that a window size of 3 yielded the best results, outperforming the use of keywords alone. Furthermore, utilizing data only prior to 2017, our regression projections for the period of 2017-2021 exhibited a high coefficient of determination (R2), which reached up to 0.78, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in predicting long-term trends. Based on the prediction, studies related to proteins and tumors will be pushed out of the top 20 and become replaced by early diagnostics, tomography, and other detection technologies. These are certain areas that are well-suited to incorporate AI technology. Deep learning, machine learning, and neural networks continue to be the dominant AI technologies in biomedical applications. Generative adversarial networks represent an emerging technology with a strong growth trend. Conclusions In this study, we explored AI trends in the biomedical field and developed a predictive model to forecast future trends. Our findings were confirmed through experiments on current trends.

AB  - The combination of new-generation information technology and manufacturing technology has had in a significant and profound impact on the future development paradigm of manufacturing. Machine tools are the basis of virtually everything that is manufactured in the industry, exploring the development of the machine tool domain is of considerable significance to identify the opportunity to develop manufacturing industry and promote the sustainable development of manufacturing in the current tightening constraints of resource environment. Although much attention has been paid to development studies of a specific domain in recent years, it is challenging to conduct a multidimensional study related to the development status of the machine tool domain using existing methods. To solve this challenge, we propose an integrating framework combining topic models, bibliometric, trend analysis and patent analysis to mine multi-source literature within the machine tool domain, including papers, funds, patents, and news. Specifically, papers and funds provided two different perspectives to explore the development status in the research of machine tools. Furthermore, the technology development of machine tools was investigated through patents analysis. Finally, news related to the machine tool industry in recent years was analyzed to examine business focuses on machine tools. The integration of above various analytical methods and multi-dimensional mining of literature enabled analyzing the development of the machine tool domain systematically from multi-perspectives that include research, technology development and industry to provide inspirations about the implications of sustainable development of this domain. The conclusions obtained in this paper is beneficial to different communities of machine tools, in terms of determining the research directions for researchers, identifying industry opportunities for corporations and developing reasonable industry policy for policy makers.

AB  - Forests serve as the largest carbon reservoir in terrestrial ecosystems, playing a crucial role in mitigating global warming and achieving the goal of “carbon neutrality”. Forest biomass is intrinsically related to carbon sinks and sources in forest ecosystems, and thus, the accurate monitoring of forest biomass is of great significance in ensuring ecological security and maintaining the global carbon balance. Significantly, remote sensing is not only able to estimate forest biomass at a large spatial scale but does so quickly, accurately, and without loss. Moreover, it can obtain forest biomass in areas inaccessible to human beings, which have become the main data source for forest biomass estimation at present. For this reason, this study analyzes the current research status, research hotspots, and future research trends in the field of remote sensing monitoring of forest biomass based on 1678 forest biomass remote sensing monitoring results from 1985 to 2023 obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection database. The results showed that the following: (1) The number of publications showed an exponential upward trend from 1985 to 2023, with an average annual growth rate of 2.64%. The top ten journals contributed to 53.76% of the total number of publications and 52.89% of the total number of citations in the field. (2) In particular, Remote Sensing of Environment has maintained a leading position in the field for an extended period, boasting the highest impact factor. Additionally, the author Saatchi S. stands out with the highest total number of citations for articles. (3) Keyword clustering analysis revealed that the main research topics in the remote sensing monitoring of forest biomass can be categorized into the following: optical remote sensing, LiDAR remote sensing, SAR remote sensing, and carbon stock. The explosion of keywords in the last six years indicates that an increasing number of researchers are focusing on carbon, airborne LiDAR data, biomass mapping, and constructing optimal biomass models.

AB  - The rapid development of digital technologies, digital transformation, business innovation, and the emergence of such technologies as artificial intelligence, blockchain, the Internet of Things provides significant potential for transforming business processes and creating new innovative models. The trend analysis conducted in this article (using the Google Trends tool) around the world for 2009-2023 showed that public interest in “business innovation” was almost constant until 2021 (according to the GT Scale, it ranged from 0.25 to 0.5). After 2021, it increased (according to the GT Scale, it was more than 0.5). At the same time, public interest in “digital transformation” has significantly increased since 2014, reaching almost maximum values in 2020-2023 (0.75 – 1.00 on the GT Scale). This confirms a growing need in society to acquire new knowledge related to the ability of businesses to adapt to digital transformation, including through creating innovative developments. Unlike trend analysis, bibliometric and comparative analyses identify trends in developing interest in this topic not among ordinary citizens – users of the Google search platform ‒ but among scientists who publish the results of their research either in monographs or in authoritative peer-reviewed scientific journals indexed by leading scientometric databases. The comparative analysis conducted in the article using the Google Books Ngram Viewer (Google) tool, which displays the frequency of references to relevant terms in English-language books for 2009-2019 worldwide, showed similar trends: the persistence of scholars’ attention to business innovation, while their interest in digital transformation is growing: in 2009-2013 – a slight increase, in 2013-2019 ‒ a significant increase. In the bibliometric analysis, a five-level mechanism for limiting the research sample was applied: only English-language and most recent (for 2018-2022) scientific articles indexed by the Scopus database in the subject area of Business, Management and Accounting were subject to analysis. Based on these limitations, the research sample for the keyword “digital transformation” was reduced from 12131 to 1700 papers, and for “business innovation” from 865 to 70. The analysis of the published articles, their views and citations, carried out using the SciVal tool, fully confirmed the conclusions drawn from the trend and comparative analysis results. In terms of digital transformation, the leaders in terms of the number of papers and the number of views are Germany, Italy, the UK and the US; in terms of citations – the UK, Germany, the US, and in terms of individual scientists – Brazil and Germany. As for the topic of business innovation, the United States is the undisputed leader in all these parameters, followed by China and the United Kingdom. Some scientists from Germany and Spain also attract the attention of the academic community (in terms of views and citations). Changes in trends and research priorities in each of the studied topics were identified and described using SciVal (analysis of the reference dynamics to the top 50 keywords in articles for 2018-2023). For example, in 2023, compared to 2022, scientific interest in issues related to “value creation” (+61.5%), “incumbents” (+66.7%), “service economy” (+83.3%), “digital marketing” (+75.0%), and “design thinking” (+150.0%) increased the most. VOSviewer software made it possible to cluster the scientific work by thematic areas. The largest cluster on digital transformation relates this concept to small and medium-sized businesses and technologies, and the largest cluster on business innovation relates it to the development of small and medium-sized enterprises and the protection of property rights.

AB  - In recent years, blockchain research has drawn attention from all across the world. It is a decentralized competence that is spread out and uncertain. Several nations and scholars have already successfully applied blockchain in numerous arenas. Blockchain is essential in delicate situations because it secures data and keeps it from being altered or forged. In addition, the market’s increased demand for data is driving demand for data scaling across all industries. Researchers from many nations have used blockchain in various sectors over time, thus bringing extreme focus to this newly escalating blockchain domain. Every research project begins with in-depth knowledge about the working domain, and new interest information about blockchain is quite scattered. This study analyzes academic literature on blockchain technology, emphasizing three key aspects: blockchain storage, scalability, and availability. These are critical areas within the broader field of blockchain technology. This study employs CiteSpace and VOSviewer to understand the current state of research in these areas comprehensively. These are bibliometric analysis tools commonly used in academic research to examine patterns and relationships within scientific literature. Thus, to visualize a way to store data with scalability and availability while keeping the security of the blockchain in sync, the required research has been performed on the storage, scalability, and availability of data in the blockchain environment. The ultimate goal is to contribute to developing secure and efficient data storage solutions within blockchain technology.

AB  - Abstract The exponential growth of social media has brought with it an increasing propagation of hate speech and hate based propaganda. Hate speech is commonly defined as any communication that disparages a person or a group on the basis of some characteristics such as race, colour, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion. Online hate diffusion has now developed into a serious problem and this has led to a number of international initiatives being proposed, aimed at qualifying the problem and developing effective counter-measures. The aim of this paper is to analyse the knowledge structure of hate speech literature and the evolution of related topics. We apply co-word analysis methods to identify different topics treated in the field. The analysed database was downloaded from Scopus, focusing on a number of publications during the last thirty years. Topic and network analyses of literature showed that the main research topics can be divided into three areas: “general debate hate speech versus freedom of expression”,“hate-speech automatic detection and classification by machine-learning strategies”, and “gendered hate speech and cyberbullying”. The understanding of how research fronts interact led to stress the relevance of machine learning approaches to correctly assess hatred forms of online speech.

AB  - The term “oligometastasis” represents a relatively novel idea, which denotes a condition characterized by cancer dissemination with a limited number of lesions (usually fewer than five). The aim of the present study is to report a bibliometric analysis of the oligometastatic disease/state, incorporating all relevant studies on the topic for more than 20 years. The research strategy included at least one the terms “Oligmetastases”, “Oligometastasis”, “Oligometastatic”, “Oligoprogression, “Oligoprogressive”, “Oligorecurrent”, or “Oligorecurrency” in the title, abstract, and/or keywords. All English-language documents from 1 January 1995 (the year of the earliest available document in Scopus) to 31 December 2022 were considered for the analysis. R code (R version 4.2.0) with R Studio (version 2022.12.0-353) and the Bibliometrix package (version 4.0.1) were used for the analysis. A total of 3304 documents, mainly articles (n = 2083, 63.0%) and reviews (n = 813, 24.6%), were collected from 1995 to 2022. The average annual growth rate of literature on the topic was 26.7%. Overall 15,176 authors published on the topic, with an average of eight authors/publication. From 1995, 69 countries contributed to the literature, with the USA and Italy being the top contributors. Among all keywords used by authors, the top three were oligometastases (19%), SBRT (18%), and radiation therapy (8%). Themes regarding “locoregional treatment”, “organ motion”, and “immunotherapy” were the most recent trend topics, mainly developed from 2019 to 2022, while “high-dose chemotherapy”, “whole-brain radiotherapy”, and “metastatic breast cancer” saw their main development during 2009–2018. Our study shows the exceptionally flourishing scientific production on the oligometastatic state, summarizing the most influential studies and highlighting the future developments and interests. This analysis will serve as a benchmark to identify this area for the attention of researchers worldwide and contribute to the increasing scientific work.

AB  - Co-working spaces (CWSs) have emerged as a distinctive phenomenon in the sharing economy. They are collaborative environments that feed innovation and creativity under the slogan “working alone together”. While policy makers and scholars were optimistic about their role in promoting entrepreneurial endeavours and fostering growth, the spread of the COVID-19 across the world has drastically changed the way we work, communicate, and navigate daily life. This study offers a comprehensive review of the existing literature on CWSs. To do so, a bibliometric analysis is proposed, combining the use of traditional bibliometric tools with science mapping techniques. A total of 118 documents are reviewed and the results are presented at two different levels: (1) descriptive analysis of the status of the research on a CWS and (2) its conceptual structure (topics and trends). The study concludes with some directions for future research. Specifically, based on the recurrent topics discussed up to date in the literature, it is possible to identify four key areas—i.e., geographical location, physical space, business models and inclusive communities—that are promising for research and that may bring useful insights for defining co-working’s place in a post-pandemic society.

AB  - Background Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by radical cystectomy (RC) remains the cornerstone of treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). While platinum-based regimens have demonstrated benefits in tumor downstaging and improved long-term survival for selected patients, they may pose risks for those who are ineligible or unresponsive to chemotherapy. Objective We undertook a bibliometric analysis to elucidate the breadth of literature on NAC in bladder cancer, discern research trajectories, and underscore emerging avenues of investigation. Methods A systematic search of the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) was conducted to identify articles pertaining to NAC in bladder cancer from 1999 to 2022. Advanced bibliometric tools, such as VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and SCImago Graphica, facilitated the examination and depicted the publication trends, geographic contributions, institutional affiliations, journal prominence, author collaborations, and salient keywords, emphasizing the top 25 citation bursts. Results Our analysis included 1836 publications spanning 1999 to 2022, indicating a growing trend in both annual publications and citations related to NAC in bladder cancer. The United States emerged as the predominant contributor in terms of publications, citations, and international collaborations. The University of Texas was the leading institution in publication output. “Urologic Oncology Seminars and Original Investigations” was the primary publishing journal, while “European Urology” boasted the highest impact factor. Shariat, Shahrokh F., and Grossman, H.B., were identified as the most prolific and co-cited authors, respectively. Keyword analysis revealed both frequency of occurrence and citation bursts, highlighting areas of concentrated study. Notably, the integration of immunochemotherapy is projected to experience substantial growth in forthcoming research. Conclusions Our bibliometric assessment provides a panoramic view of the research milieu surrounding neoadjuvant chemotherapy for bladder cancer, encapsulating the present state, evolving trends, and potential future directions, with a particular emphasis on the promise of immunochemotherapy.

AB  - Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a noninvasive brain function detection technique based on the principle of neuro-vascular coupling. Based on a bibliometric approach, the present study visualizes and analyses the number of publications, countries, institutions, authors, co-citations and keywords of fNIRS with the help of Web of Science core collection database platform, CiteSpace and VOS-viewer software, and provides a narrative review of the literature in the past decade to comprehensively analyze the application and future development trend of fNIRS in clinical practice. The findings reveal that fNIRS is a clinically valuable tool with numerous advantages. It is therefore widely utilized to capture brain cortical activity data in both resting and task-related states. It enables the analysis of brain functional states from multiple dimensions and can be combined with other brain imaging techniques, improving the identification and detection of various neurological disorders, psychiatric conditions, pediatric medicine, and sports medicine. In the future, fNIRS technology is expected to achieve higher spatiotemporal resolution, increased data collection capacity, reduced interference and errors, and expanded application scope, thereby supporting clinical and research endeavors.

AB  - • This study reviews the literature on risk-return modeling in p2p lending market. • Our research identifies the most influential works and critical references. • Our paper shows the research trends through bibliometric visualization tools. • ML support most new approaches and improve the performance of traditional models. • Several works lack explainability and a genuine understanding of business use. Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending is a market with significant growth in recent years. We review the academic literature published during the last decade on P2P lending to identify the main research trends and find potential gaps that limit stakeholders' use of research proposals. We perform both a bibliometric and systematic analysis. The bibliometric analysis will identify the most influential papers and the relationship and evolution of the main topics. In the systematic analysis, we categorized the documents according to methodological elements and business aspects. Remarkably, many proposals include artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms. However, many of them lack a proper understanding of the application context, the definition of potential variables in a business framework, explainability, etc. Such elements should be recognized as essential elements to exploit their benefits. In this respect, we provide some recommendations and show future research directions.

AB  - Artificial intelligence, as an emerging and multidisciplinary domain of research and innovation, has attracted growing attention in recent years. Delineating the domain composition of artificial intelligence is central to profiling and tracking its development and trajectories. This paper puts forward a bibliometric definition for artificial intelligence which can be readily applied, including by researchers, managers, and policy analysts. Our approach starts with benchmark records of artificial intelligence captured by using a core keyword and specialized journal search. We then extract candidate terms from high frequency keywords of benchmark records, refine keywords and complement with the subject category "artificial intelligence". We assess our search approach by comparing it with other three recent search strategies of artificial intelligence, using a common source of articles from the Web of Science. Using this source, we then profile patterns of growth and international diffusion of scientific research in artificial intelligence in recent years, identify top research sponsors in funding artificial intelligence and demonstrate how diverse disciplines contribute to the multidisciplinary development of artificial intelligence. We conclude with implications for search strategy development and suggestions of lines for further research.

AB  - Abstract The history of AI in economics is long and winding, much the same as the evolving field of AI itself. Economists have engaged with AI since its beginnings, albeit in varying degrees and with changing focus across time and places. In this study, we have explored the diffusion of AI and different AI methods (e.g., machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, expert systems, knowledge-based systems) through and within economic subfields, taking a scientometrics approach. In particular, we centre our accompanying discussion of AI in economics around the problems of economic calculation and social planning as proposed by Hayek. To map the history of AI within and between economic sub-fields, we construct two datasets containing bibliometrics information of economics papers based on search query results from the Scopus database and the EconPapers (and IDEAs/RePEc) repository. We present descriptive results that map the use and discussion of AI in economics over time, place, and subfield. In doing so, we also characterise the authors and affiliations of those engaging with AI in economics. Additionally, we find positive correlations between quality of institutional affiliation and engagement with or focus on AI in economics and negative correlations between the Human Development Index and share of learning-based AI papers.

AB  - - In the last five years, there has been an accelerated growth in the scientific production about Artificial Intelligence and Healthcare by Scholars of the most diverse disciplines. Recently, the scientific corpus has been enriched with considerable literature reviews ranging from the overview of large collections of scientific documents to the recognition of the state of knowledge on specific aspects (e.g., in the medical field, ophthalmology, cardiology, nephrology, etc.). - The methodological approaches belong to the scientific fields of bibliometrics and topic modeling. Following a bibliometric analysis of the literature on the subject, conducted on a vast collection of scientific contributions, we also searched for the "latent" themes in the semantic structures of these documents, identified the relationships between them and recognized the most likely to be investigated in the future. – Results show 24 topics about future trends in literature review connecting the field of AI and Healthcare. - This bibliometric review of the literature on artificial intelligence and healthcare allows identifying of some privileged areas of attention by scholars of different disciplines. However, it also reveals the limits of hard clustering techniques, as demonstrated by the presence of some keywords in several groups. The numerous existing reviews must be integrated by reviews based on Topic Modeling techniques, which make it possible to identify topics, historical trends (classical and emerging topics), associations between the documents and to predict, on a probabilistic basis, which scientific fields will be most likely to see development in the future.

AB  - The construction industry has great potential for carbon emission reduction, which strongly impacts the peak of carbon emissions and carbon neutrality. This paper compares foreign and Chinese articles on building carbon emissions from publication objects, journals, subject categories, authors, and institutions. It discusses the differences in research trends and hotspots from keywords, reference co-citation analysis, and historical citation analysis. The results show that the number of publications on building carbon emissions steadily increased. The research on building carbon emissions in foreign articles is earlier and more systematic than that in China, and the output and influence of foreign articles are generally more prominent than those of Chinese articles. However, the production and influence of articles by certain Chinese authors and institutions have been remarkable. The topics of ‘CO2 emission’, ‘life-cycle assessment’, ‘environmental impact’, ‘greenhouse gas emission’, and ‘renewable energy’ are essential subjects for foreign and Chinese articles in the research field of building carbon emissions and the development trend is similar. The thematic direction of Chinese articles is more divergent and lacks well-developed themes that greatly influence other research themes. Finally, based on the research results, this study puts forward the potential future research direction of building carbon emissions. The results of this study will provide a current and systematic overview of this field, which will be helpful for future researchers to promote the development of research on building carbon emissions.

AB  - The primary purpose of this study is to conduct a scientometrics analysis of stock market forecasts based on artificial intelligence. This research examined 1,301 publications that were published between January 2002 and June 2022. We investigated 183 journal articles among 1,329 papers. In addition to entering the keywords into Scopus, a comprehensive dataset of relevant research papers was compiled. These papers discussed the optimization of investment portfolios, artificial intelligence-based stock market forecasts, investor emotions, and market monitoring. We found the most prolific documents by affiliation, the most prolific author, the most cited papers, nations, institutions, co-authorship maps, inter-country co-authorship maps, and keywords occurrences in this study. Co-authorship analysis network maps and keyword occurrence linkages are generated using the VOS-viewer software. According to our findings, it is evident from the review that the body of literature is becoming more specific and extensive. Primarily, neural networks, support vector machines, and neuro-fuzzy systems are employed to predict the future price of a stock market index based on the composite index's historical prices. Artificial intelligence techniques are able to consider challenges facing financial systems when forecasting time series. Our findings provide actionable guidance on how artificial intelligence can be used to predict stock market movements for market participants, including traders, investors, and financial institutions.

AB  - Introduction Since the significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, the application of AI in bladder cancer has rapidly expanded. AI can be used in all aspects of the bladder cancer field, including diagnosis, treatment and prognosis prediction. Nowadays, these technologies have an excellent medical auxiliary effect and are in explosive development, which has aroused the intense interest of researchers. This study will provide an in-depth analysis using bibliometric analysis to explore the trends in this field. Method Documents regarding the application of AI in bladder cancer from 2000 to 2022 were searched and extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection. These publications were analyzed by bibliometric analysis software (CiteSpace, Vosviewer) to visualize the relationship between countries/regions, institutions, journals, authors, references, keywords. Results We analyzed a total of 2368 publications. Since 2016, the number of publications in the field of AI in bladder cancer has increased rapidly and reached a breathtaking annual growth rate of 43.98% in 2019. The U.S. has the largest research scale, the highest study level and the most significant financial support. The University of North Carolina is the institution with the highest level of research. EUROPEAN UROLOGY is the most influential journal with an impact factor of 24.267 and a total citation of 11,848. Wiklund P. has the highest number of publications, and Menon M. has the highest number of total citations. We also find hot research topics within the area through references and keywords analysis, which include two main parts: AI models for the diagnosis and prediction of bladder cancer and novel robotic-assisted surgery for bladder cancer radicalization and urinary diversion. Conclusion AI application in bladder cancer is widely studied worldwide and has shown an explosive growth trend since the 21st century. AI-based diagnostic and predictive models will be the next protagonists in this field. Meanwhile, the robot-assisted surgery is still a hot topic and it is worth exploring the application of AI in it. The advancement and application of algorithms will be a massive driving force in this field.

AB  - Land use planning studies are accumulating in unprecedented quantities, and have created a wide space for an extensive summary, the synthesis of fundamental developments, a sharpening of the focus of future study issues, and the dissemination of concise information among the academic community and the policy making environment. Nonetheless, the publication rate and content coverage of land use planning literature reviews have been relatively low. This study aims to contribute to the field by first assessing the effectiveness of the bibliometric method as a literature study method. It then summarizes the developments in the land use planning literature in general path building process, the planning context, and the development of methods. The study findings highlight that the bibliometric method tends to reward information carriage papers rather than original contributors. More than 85% of the time, published articles are cited for general information rather than their core research contribution, suggesting the incomprehensiveness of the bibliometric method in studying real knowledge development. In terms of the land use planning context, significant gaps are observed, particularly in urban land use, including the detachment of the general goal-oriented objective formulations from basic land use allocation theories and conceptual models. A serious concern also arises that the formulations of certain urban land use optimization objectives appear to contradict the original concept of a sustainable city. To address these gaps, this paper suggests several key research frontiers, including linking the basic land use allocation and utility theories to land use optimization, and a need to shift current urban land use planning/optimization approaches from spatial optimization, which changes land uses to meet flow resources, towards optimizing the flow of resources to fit the resilient nature of existing spatial configurations and physical establishments in the built environment. Additionally, evaluating the existing built environment for optimality should be prioritized rather than solely focusing on new developments. In terms of method development, the study suggests that advancing current loosely coupled methods into more integrated systems may be a promising frontier. In general, the paper strongly suggests the possible reiteration of the land use planning study landscape to make sustainable development discourse more concrete and to make the method development stage involve more integrated systems. Immediate research interventions may be the standardizing of land use planning studies through the development of protocols and standard benchmark problems.

AB  - The detection of emerging trends is of great interest to many stakeholders such as government and industry. Previous research focused on the machine learning, network analysis and time series analysis based on the bibliometrics data and made a promising progress. However, these approaches inevitably have time delay problems. For the reason that leader papers of "emerging topics" share the similar characters with the "cover papers", this study present a novel approach to translate the "emerging topics" detection to "cover paper" prediction. By using "AdaBoost model" and topic model, we construct a machine learning framework to imitate the top journal (chief) editor's judgement to select cover paper from material science. The results of our prediction were validated by consulting with field experts. This approach was also suitable for the Nature, Science, and Cell journals.

AB  - Over the last decades, safety requirements have become of primary concern. In the context of safety, several strategies could be pursued in many engineering fields. Moreover, many techniques have been proposed to deal with safety, risk, and reliability matters, such as Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). ML and DL are characterised by a high variety of algorithms, adaptable for different purposes. This generated wide and fragmented literature on ML and DL for safety purposes, moreover, literature review and bibliometric studies of the past years mainly focus on a single research area or application field. Thus, this paper aims to provide a holistic understanding of the research on this topic through a Systematic Bibliometric Analysis (SBA), along with proposing a viable option to conduct SBAs. The focus is on investigating the main research areas, application fields, relevant authors and studies, and temporal evolution. It emerged that rotating equipment, structural health monitoring, batteries, aeroengines, and turbines are popular fields. Moreover, the results depicted an increase in popularity of DL, along with new approaches such as deep reinforcement learning through the past four years. The proposed workflow for SBA has the potential to benefit researchers from multiple disciplines, beyond safety science.

AB  - Facing the challenges of globalisation and unpredictable shocks, manufacturers seek novel methods to maintain the sustainability of their supply chains. Adopting Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies facilitates sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) with the precise decision-making of supply chain activities and the realisation of circular development. However, according to the bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review of articles related to “SSCM”, few frameworks with I4.0 technologies are found to empower SSCM under circular economy (CE) logic. Thus, this article proposes a conceptual framework of I4.0 technologies-embedded SSCM, which takes advantage of five kinds of emerging digital technologies, including cloud services, artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics (BDA), blockchain technology (BT), and internet of things (IoT). The CAB2IN framework is based on the technologies mentioned above alongside the design, manufacturing, delivering, using, and end-of-life stages of products and services to meet the requirements of reducing material usage, remanufacturing, reusing, and recycling. This paper's contribution lies in indicating the trends of SSCM in the era of Industry 4.0 and proposing CAB2IN to creatively establish the virtual side of circular SSCM, which leverages the data generated in each stage to assist sustainable decision-making. CAB2IN illuminates several research directions for future studies of digitalised SSCM under the perspective of CE. The case of Company S illustrates the application of CAB2IN in the healthcare supply chain. This paper also summarises insightful directions of digitalised SSCM under the proposed circular framework.

AB  - Early warning systems (EWS) facilitate societies’ preparedness and effective response capabilities to climate risks. Climate risks embody hazards, exposure, and vulnerability associated with a particular geographical area. Building an effective EWS requires consideration of the factors above to help people with coping mechanisms. The objective of this paper is to propose an approach that can enhance EWSs and ensure an effective climate risk resilience development. The paper focuses on the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region and highlights the issues with EWS, identifying weaknesses and characteristics of EWS to help in climate risk adaptation strategies. The SADC region was chosen as the context because it is a climate variability and change hotspot with many vulnerable populations residing in rural communities. Trending themes on building climate risk resilience were uncovered through scientific mapping and network analysis of published articles from 2008 to 2022. This paper contributes to on-going research on building climate risks resilience through early warning systems to identify hidden trends and emerging technologies from articles in order to enhance the operationalization and design of EWS. This review provides insight into technological interventions for assessing climate risks to build preparedness and resilience. From the review analysis, it is determined that there exists a plethora of evidence to support the argument that involving communities in the co-designing of EWS would improve risk knowledge, anticipation, and preparedness. Additionally, Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies provide effective tools to address existing EWS’ weaknesses, such as lack of real-time data collection and automation. However, 4IR technology is still at a nascent stage in EWS applications in Africa. Furthermore, policy across societies, institutions, and technology industries ought to be coordinated and integrated to develop a strategy toward implementing climate resilient-based EWS to facilitate the operations of disaster risk managers. The Social, Institutional, and Technology model can potentially increase communities’ resilience; therefore, it is recommended to develop EWS.

AB  - Big data is the concept of enormous amounts of data being generated daily in different fields due to the increased use of technology and internet sources. Despite the various advancements and the hopes of better understanding, big data management and analysis remain a challenge, calling for more rigorous and detailed research, as well as the identifications of methods and ways in which big data could be tackled and put to good use. The existing research lacks in discussing and evaluating the pertinent tools and technologies to analyze big data in an efficient manner which calls for a comprehensive and holistic analysis of the published articles to summarize the concept of big data and see field-specific applications. To address this gap and keep a recent focus, research articles published in last decade, belonging to top-tier and high-impact journals, were retrieved using the search engines of Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science that were narrowed down to a set of 139 relevant research articles. Different analyses were conducted on the retrieved papers including bibliometric analysis, keywords analysis, big data search trends, and authors’ names, countries, and affiliated institutes contributing the most to the field of big data. The comparative analyses show that, conceptually, big data lies at the intersection of the storage, statistics, technology, and research fields and emerged as an amalgam of these four fields with interlinked aspects such as data hosting and computing, data management, data refining, data patterns, and machine learning. The results further show that major characteristics of big data can be summarized using the seven Vs, which include variety, volume, variability, value, visualization, veracity, and velocity. Furthermore, the existing methods for big data analysis, their shortcomings, and the possible directions were also explored that could be taken for harnessing technology to ensure data analysis tools could be upgraded to be fast and efficient. The major challenges in handling big data include efficient storage, retrieval, analysis, and visualization of the large heterogeneous data, which can be tackled through authentication such as Kerberos and encrypted files, logging of attacks, secure communication through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS), data imputation, building learning models, dividing computations into sub-tasks, checkpoint applications for recursive tasks, and using Solid State Drives (SDD) and Phase Change Material (PCM) for storage. In terms of frameworks for big data management, two frameworks exist including Hadoop and Apache Spark, which must be used simultaneously to capture the holistic essence of the data and make the analyses meaningful, swift, and speedy. Further field-specific applications of big data in two promising and integrated fields, i.e., smart real estate and disaster management, were investigated, and a framework for field-specific applications, as well as a merger of the two areas through big data, was highlighted. The proposed frameworks show that big data can tackle the ever-present issues of customer regrets related to poor quality of information or lack of information in smart real estate to increase the customer satisfaction using an intermediate organization that can process and keep a check on the data being provided to the customers by the sellers and real estate managers. Similarly, for disaster and its risk management, data from social media, drones, multimedia, and search engines can be used to tackle natural disasters such as floods, bushfires, and earthquakes, as well as plan emergency responses. In addition, a merger framework for smart real estate and disaster risk management show that big data generated from the smart real estate in the form of occupant data, facilities management, and building integration and maintenance can be shared with the disaster risk management and emergency response teams to help prevent, prepare, respond to, or recover from the disasters.

AB  - This review paper adopts bibliometric and meta-analysis approaches to explore the application of supervised machine learning regression models in satellite-based water quality monitoring. The consistent pattern observed across peer-reviewed research papers shows an increasing interest in the use of satellites as an innovative approach for monitoring water quality, a critical step towards addressing the challenges posed by rising anthropogenic water pollution. Traditional methods of monitoring water quality have limitations, but satellite sensors provide a potential solution to that by lowering costs and expanding temporal and spatial coverage. However, conventional statistical methods are limited when faced with the formidable challenge of conducting pattern recognition analysis for satellite geospatial big data because they are characterized by high volume and complexity. As a compelling alternative, the application of machine and deep learning techniques has emerged as an indispensable tool, with the remarkable capability to discern intricate patterns in the data that might otherwise remain elusive to traditional statistics. The study employed a targeted search strategy, utilizing specific criteria and the titles of 332 peer-reviewed journal articles indexed in Scopus, resulting in the inclusion of 165 articles for the meta-analysis. Our comprehensive bibliometric analysis provides insights into the trends, research productivity, and impact of satellite-based water quality monitoring. It highlights key journals and publishers in this domain while examining the relationship between the first author’s presentation, publication year, citation count, and journal impact factor. The major review findings highlight the widespread use of satellite sensors in water quality monitoring including the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI), Operational Land Imager (OLI), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and the practice of multi-sensor data fusion. Deep neural networks are identified as popular and high-performing algorithms, with significant competition from extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), even though XGBoost is relatively newer in the field of machine learning. Chlorophyll-a and water clarity indicators receive special attention, and geo-location had a relationship with optical water classes. This paper contributes significantly by providing extensive examples and in-depth discussions of papers with code, as well as highlighting the critical cyber infrastructure used in this research. Advances in high-performance computing, large-scale data processing capabilities, and the availability of open-source software are facilitating the growing prominence of machine and deep learning applications in geospatial artificial intelligence for water quality monitoring, and this is positively contributing towards monitoring water pollution.

AB  - The concept of smart cities has gained significant momentum in science and policy circles over the past decade. This study aims to provide an overview of the structure and trends in the literature on smart cities. Bibliometric analysis and science mapping techniques using VOSviewer and CiteSpace are used to identify the thematic focus of over 5000 articles indexed in the Web of Science since 1991. In addition to providing insights into the thematic evolution of the field, the three-decade study period is divided into two sub-periods (1991–2015 and 2016–2021). While splitting the dataset into more sub-periods would have been desirable, we decided to only examine two sub-periods as only very few papers have been published until 2010. The annual number of publications has progressively increased since then, with a surge in the annual number of publications observable from 2015 onwards. The thematic analysis showed that the intellectual base of the field has been very limited during the first period, but has expanded significantly since 2015. Over time, some thematic evolutions, such as further attention to linkages to climate change and resilience, and more emphasis on security and privacy issues, have been made. The thematic analysis shows that existing research on smart cities is dominated by either conceptual issues or underlying technical aspects. It is, therefore, essential to do more research on the implementation of smart cities and actual and/or potential contributions of smart cities to solving societal issues. In addition to elaborating on thematic focus, the study also highlights major authors, journals, references, countries, and institutions that have contributed to the development of the smart cities literature.

AB  - In recent years, the smart city concept has developed rapidly and has gradually become the most popular urban concept. However, the advent of the new century has been accompanied by the emergence of many other emerging city concepts. For these emerging urban concepts, such as a resilient city, low-carbon city, sponge city, and inclusive city, it needs to be clarified how these concepts relate to a smart city. In this paper, the scientometrics software Pajek was used to analyze the publication activities of the city concept and two-mode keywords co-occurrence network with cities. Meanwhile, the study also explores these concepts’ global development and correlation. Further, it also analyzes the core problems that each city concept addresses through a literature review. It was observed that although the research content of these four city concepts is different from that of smart cities, they are conceptually and technologically connected with them. The development of smart cities can accelerate the smart development of other city concepts. At the same time, it can acquire and absorb more advanced models from other city concepts to enrich itself. The results suggest that the development of city concepts should be more comprehensive to help cities become more inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable, which has important implications for urban policy and practice.

AB  - This paper offers a comprehensive overview of machine learning (ML) methodologies and algorithms, highlighting their practical applications in the critical domain of water resource management. Environmental issues, such as climate change and ecosystem destruction, pose significant threats to humanity and the planet. Addressing these challenges necessitates sustainable resource management and increased efficiency. Artificial intelligence (AI) and ML technologies present promising solutions in this regard. By harnessing AI and ML, we can collect and analyze vast amounts of data from diverse sources, such as remote sensing, smart sensors, and social media. This enables real-time monitoring and decision making in water resource management. AI applications, including irrigation optimization, water quality monitoring, flood forecasting, and water demand forecasting, enhance agricultural practices, water distribution models, and decision making in desalination plants. Furthermore, AI facilitates data integration, supports decision-making processes, and enhances overall water management sustainability. However, the wider adoption of AI in water resource management faces challenges, such as data heterogeneity, stakeholder education, and high costs. To provide an overview of ML applications in water resource management, this research focuses on core fundamentals, major applications (prediction, clustering, and reinforcement learning), and ongoing issues to offer new insights. More specifically, after the in-depth illustration of the ML algorithmic taxonomy, we provide a comparative mapping of all ML methodologies to specific water management tasks. At the same time, we include a tabulation of such research works along with some concrete, yet compact, descriptions of their objectives at hand. By leveraging ML tools, we can develop sustainable water resource management plans and address the world’s water supply concerns effectively.

AB  - The digital twin has recently become a popular topic in research related to manufacturing, such as Industry 4.0, the industrial internet of things, and cyber-physical systems. In addition, digital twins are the focus of several research areas: construction, urban management, digital transformation of the economy, medicine, virtual reality, software testing, and others. The concept is not yet fully defined, its scope seems unlimited, and the topic is relatively new; all this can present a barrier to research. The main goal of this paper is to develop a proper methodology for visualizing the digital-twin science landscape using modern bibliometric tools, text-mining and topic-modeling, based on machine learning models—Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The scope of the study includes 8693 publications on the topic selected from the Scopus database, published between January 1993 and September 2022. Keyword co-occurrence analysis and topic-modeling indicate that studies on digital twins are still in the early stage of development. At the same time, the core of the topic is growing, and some topic clusters are emerging. More than 100 topics can be identified; the most popular and fastest-growing topic is ‘digital twins of industrial robots, production lines and objects.’ Further efforts are needed to verify the proposed methodology, which can be achieved by analyzing other research fields.

AB  - Conducted on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) addressing antibiotic resistance in the PubMed database, this bibliometric analysis explores relevant sources, keyword co-occurrence, institutional co-authorship, global collaboration patterns, and evolving research trends. Utilizing an electronic search on January 13, 2024, employing the term "antibiotic resistance," 252,657 results were retrieved, of which 2,962 RCTs were analyzed. The dissemination of RCTs exhibited a variable distribution from 1965 to 2023, with a peak in 2014, noteworthy peaks in 1993-1994 and 2002-2003, contrasting declines in 1990-1991 and 2007-2008, and a consistent decrease post 2018. The University of California emerged as a predominant institution, and the journal "Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy" substantially contributed. The annual growth rate stood at 1.2%, with 97 single-authored documents, an average of 8.76 co-authors per document, and 8.89% international co-authorships. Co-occurrence analysis highlighted prevalent themes, including double-blind clinical trials and significant keywords like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, Helicobacter infections, metronidazole, and amoxicillin. Trend analysis revealed a chronological shift from penicillin to HIV and Helicobacter drug therapies, culminating in combination antibacterial therapy for multiple bacterial strains. The prevailing trend in antibiotic resistance publications involved single-country endeavors, with the United States leading in collaboration frequency. The findings indicate a need to foster international collaboration, promote interdisciplinary research, support emerging trends, encourage open-access publication, and address declines in research activity, particularly RCTs.

AB  - Achieving sustainable rural development is challenging. However, revitalizing the rural economy is one of the most suitable strategies to overcome sustainable development problems. The rural revitalization strategy aims to create an idealized sustainable development model for rural areas which can avoid the current crisis and utilize institutional advantages to overcome the survival challenges of mostly small-scale peasant economies. The logic of the rural revitalization strategy lies in its essential value implication and practical orientation for consolidating the foundation in rural areas, including its characteristics and its ability to realize long-term sustainable development. There is growing interest in research on rural revitalization and sustainable development, but the current status, trends, and progress are unknown. This study examines the most recent advancements in research patterns for rural revitalization and the promotion of sustainable development from 1995 to 2023. It accomplishes this by thoroughly evaluating and analyzing published scholarly material. We performed a bibliometric analysis of the literature obtained from the Scopus database using VOS Viewer software version 1.6.15. We examined a total of 403 articles and evaluated them, focusing on the precise terms “Rural Revitalization” and “Sustainable Development”. We found that post-2018, there has been a notable surge in the popularity and acceptance of research related to these topics. China ranks first in terms of publishing the greatest number of research articles. The journal Sustainability has published the most articles on sustainable development and rural revitalization, followed by Land and the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health. The Journal of Rural Studies published the most cited document. Exciting research areas include the conservation of natural resources, ecosystem cities, and rural revitalization strategies. The research findings thoroughly evaluate academic output and propose thematic areas for further investigation.

AB  - Abstract The increasing use and effectiveness of social media influencers in marketing have intrigued both academic scholars and industry professionals. To shed light on the foundations and trends of this contemporary phenomenon, this study undertakes a systematic literature review using a bibliometric-content analysis to map the extant literature where consumer behavior, social media, and influencer marketing are intertwined. Using 214 articles published in journals indexed by the Australian Business Deans Council (ABDC), Chartered Association of Business Schools (CABS), and Web of Science (WOS) from 2008 to 2021, this study unpacks the articles, journals, methods, theories, themes, and constructs (antecedents, moderators, mediators, and consequences) in extant research on social media influencer marketing. Noteworthily, the review highlighted that the major research streams in social media influencer marketing research involve parasocial interactions and relationships, sponsorship, authenticity, and engagement and influence. The review also revealed the prominent role of audience-, brand-, comparative-, content-, influencer-, social-, and technology-related factors in influencing how consumers react to social media influencer marketing. The insights derived from this one-stop, state-of-the-art review can help social media influencers and marketing scholars and professionals to recognize key characteristics and trends of social media influencer marketing, and thus, drive new research and social media marketing practices where social media influencers are employed and leveraged upon for marketing activities.

AB  - The farmers’ welfare and its interlinkages to energy efficiency and farm sustainability has attracted global scientific interest within the last few decades. This study examines the contribution of Agriculture 5.0 to the prosperity of the farmers in the post-pandemic era and the gradual transition to an energy-smart farm. To obtain an insight into the attributes of Agriculture 5.0 and the emerging technologies in the field, Bibliometrix analysis with the use of an R package was conducted based on 2000 data consisting of peer-reviewed articles. The data were retrieved from the Scopus database. A bibliometric approach was employed to analyze the data for a comprehensive overview of the trend, thematic focus, and scientific production in the field of Agriculture 5.0 and energy-smart farming. Emerging technologies that are part of Agriculture 5.0 in combination with alternative energy sources can provide cost-effective access to finance, weather updates, remotely monitoring, and future energy solutions for the establishment of smart farms. Keywords such as “renewable energy,” “Internet of Things,” and “emission control” remain the trending keywords. Moreover, thematic analysis shows that “economic and social effects”, “energy efficiency”, “remote sensing”, and “Artificial Intelligence” with their associated components such as “anaerobic digestion”, “wireless sensor network,” “agricultural robots”, and “smart agriculture” are the niche themes of Agriculture 5.0 in combination with green energy sources, which can lead to the cut cost, energy-efficient, and sustainable energy-smart farms.

AB  - Energy-efficient retrofits (EERs) are probably the most cost-effective method to address energy poverty in the residential sector. However, actual EER rates are far below those called for in recent policy goals. A large body of literature has examined the determinants influencing households’ EER decisions but with scattered and contextually limited results. Consequently, there is a lack of a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the literature in this area. In this study, a detailed literature review and bibliometric analysis of the determinants of EERs was conducted to better understand the scope and evolution of knowledge in this area. Specifically, 1198 scientific documents were systematically examined, with 1000 terms included in the final analysis. In addition, a new approach to bibliometric analysis was adopted, examining the content of abstracts rather than keywords, allowing for a more detailed analysis. This work contains important contributions. First, the result of this research is a detailed overview of the determinants of EER in residential buildings, which can be divided into five main groups: information and policy measures, economic factors, socioeconomic characteristics of households, technical and building characteristics and behavioural factors. Second, I conducted a bibliometric analysis that visualises the current state of knowledge regarding the determinants of EER in the literature. The results show that several groups of these determinants have been identified in the literature, the most influential of which are thermal comfort, energy cost, sustainable retrofit and behaviour change. These groups include 83 factors that are most relevant in the literature. Third, this study provides the historical evolution of the most influential EER determinants over the past three decades. The study suggests that future energy policies should use a mix of approaches to promote EER to comprehensively address the identified groups of determinants and multiple aspects of household members’ decision-making process.

AB  - Urban resilience is an emergent concept that is receiving an increasing attention. Its definition is linked with the ability of an urban system to resist, maintain continuity and recover through all stresses while adapting and transforming towards sustainability. The aim of this study is two-fold. First, we analyse the research output on urban resilience using bibliometric techniques and Web of Science (WoS) in order to define the scope and identify topics in the urban resilience literature. CiteSpace software is used to establish the intellectual framework. Second, their contribution to sustainability dimensions and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) based on the research output is explored. For that purpose, we examined 1014 publications during the period 1998–2020. The findings reveal urban resilience literature has grown since the 2009.A specialization in recent years from more theoretical research to a more practical is identified. In terms of contribution towards sustainability, the findings show the number of publications that directly address sustainability is scarce and more balanced to environmental and social perspectives. These findings can provide a better understanding of the patterns and trends in the field and provides first evidence of the contribution of academic research on urban resilience to sustainability.

AB  - Online Social Media (OSM) like Facebook and Twitter has emerged as a powerful tool to express via text people’s opinions and feelings about the current surrounding events. Understanding the emotions at the fine-grained level of these expressed thoughts is important for system improvement. Such crucial insights cannot be completely obtained by doing AI-based big data sentiment analysis; hence, text-based emotion detection using AI in social media big data has become an upcoming area of Natural Language Processing research. It can be used in various fields such as understanding expressed emotions, human–computer interaction, data mining, online education, recommendation systems, and psychology. Even though the research work is ongoing in this domain, it still lacks a formal study that can give a qualitative (techniques used) and quantitative (contributions) literature overview. This study has considered 827 Scopus and 83 Web of Science research papers from the years 2005–2020 for the analysis. The qualitative review represents different emotion models, datasets, algorithms, and application domains of text-based emotion detection. The quantitative bibliometric review of contributions presents research details such as publications, volume, co-authorship networks, citation analysis, and demographic research distribution. In the end, challenges and probable solutions are showcased, which can provide future research directions in this area.

AB  - The study of the relationship between sustainable built environment and user perception has often taken a single perspective, displaying neither a holistic view of the relationship nor a systematic and refined grasp of the research content previously. This has resulted in a biased understanding of the two research objects and their respective measurement methods and made it difficult to develop synergies. In this context, this paper summarises the current research hotspots and trends in the relationship between sustainable built environment and user perception through CiteSpace quantitative analyses such as keyword co-occurrence networks, emergent word detection, and disciplinary re-clustering, and takes a multidisciplinary perspective to focus on relevant research in public health, environmental science, and architecture and urban design, such as the progress of research between sustainable built environment and users in physical activity, environmental cognition, and image perception. The results show that in the environmental science field, environmental cognition is the core, based on the study of users’ direct perception of sustainable built environment and its externalisation in the expression of behaviours. The public health field and the architecture and urban design field are dominated by the study of perceptual outcomes. There is a trend towards big data as a measurement tool for research subjects in all fields with a multidisciplinary perspective and the inclusion of more disciplines can produce more meaningful research results. The study provides a framework for research into the relationship between the two from a broader perspective and provides guidance for future multidisciplinary research, with implications for the construction of high-quality human-centred urban spatial environments.

AB  - Financial inclusion, which requires granting an affordable, adequate and widespread access to a sufficient range of financial products and services, has often been considered one of the cornerstones of social development, as it can contribute to poverty reduction, narrow the income gap, lead to wiser financial decisions, help to enlarge savings, increase the productive investment and foster a greater gender equality. Information and communication technologies have shown a major potential to contribute to financial inclusion, giving birth to digital financial inclusion. Using bibliometric techniques, this paper disentangles the intellectual structure of the research on digital financial inclusion, revealing the most influential sources, authors and areas inside this research stream. The results of this paper show that we are dealing with a critical demand of current society, which is attracting a growing attention of the academic literature and should be in the spotlight of both private and public institutions.

AB  - Smart-Product Service Systems (S-PSS) emerge as a novel strategy to integrate smart products with advanced digital capabilities and their related e-services to satisfy user’s needs in highly context-dependent environments. S-PSS has the potential to generate a transition towards more economically, ecologically and socially sustainable practices and business models due to its adaptive capacities. However, being able to exploit the digital capabilities of smart products and their services is still limited in design and even more to improve the user experience. For this reason, this study will focus on the Context-awareness capability that has been defined by multiple scholars as one of the most relevant properties that defines the smartness of a product. Following a systematic literature review approach, this work makes the following contributions: (1) it provides a bibliometric analysis using a cluster keyword map to analyze the most researched topics in S-PSS relevant to the design, user experience and analyze their connections; (2) an analysis of the case studies presented in the literature according to the life cycle of context-aware applications; and (3) establishes a research direction for the user experience and design of the S-PSS.

AB  - Nowadays, open innovations such as intelligent automation and digitalization are being adopted by every industry with the help of powerful technology such as Artificial Intelligence (AI). This evolution drives systematic running processes, involves less overhead of managerial activities and increased production rate. However, it also gave birth to different kinds of attacks and security issues at the data storage level and process level. The real-life implementation of such AI-enabled intelligent systems is currently plagued by the lack of security and trust levels in system predictions. Blockchain is a prevailing technology that can help to alleviate the security risks of AI applications. These two technologies are complementing each other as Blockchain can mitigate vulnerabilities in AI, and AI can improve the performance of Blockchain. Many studies are currently being conducted on the applicability of Blockchains for securing intelligent applications in various crucial domains such as healthcare, finance, energy, government, and defense. However, this domain lacks a systematic study that can offer an overarching view of research activities currently going on in applying Blockchains for securing AI-based systems and improving their robustness. This paper presents a bibliometric and literature analysis of how Blockchain provides a security blanket to AI-based systems. Two well-known research databases (Scopus and Web of Science) have been examined for this analytical study and review. The research uncovered that idea proposals in conferences and some articles published in journals make a major contribution. However, there is still a lot of research work to be done to implement real and stable Blockchain-based AI systems.

AB  - The constant monitoring and control of various health, infrastructure, and natural factors have led to the design and development of technological devices in a wide range of fields. This has resulted in the creation of different types of sensors that can be used to monitor and control different environments, such as fire, water, temperature, and movement, among others. These sensors detect anomalies in the input data to the system, allowing alerts to be generated for early risk detection. The advancement of artificial intelligence has led to improved sensor systems and networks, resulting in devices with better performance and more precise results by incorporating various features. The aim of this work is to conduct a bibliometric analysis using the PRISMA 2020 set to identify research trends in the development of machine learning applications in fiber optic sensors. This methodology facilitates the analysis of a dataset comprised of documents obtained from Scopus and Web of Science databases. It enables the evaluation of both the quantity and quality of publications in the study area based on specific criteria, such as trends, key concepts, and advances in concepts over time. The study found that deep learning techniques and fiber Bragg gratings have been extensively researched in infrastructure, with a focus on using fiber optic sensors for structural health monitoring in future research. One of the main limitations is the lack of research on the use of novel materials, such as graphite, for designing fiber optic sensors.

AB  - The convergence of multi-disciplinary knowledge may spur emerging technologies. It is important to understand this convergence process that helps to identify these emergent technologies; however, relevant research remains sparse. Therefore, this study aims to develop a novel framework to reveal the convergence process of scientific knowledge. This novel framework integrates the machine-learning topology clustering and visualization methods, and analyzes paper citation networks. This study selects the biological–informatics domain (bioinformatics) to conduct the empirical analysis. This paper finds two major stages throughout the convergence process: the fast-changing incubation stage and the stabilized development stage. In the incubation stage, the interactions between the biology and informatics knowledge domains becomes increasingly intensive, while emergent technology is yet to form; in the stable development stage, the emergent technology starts to form as a core cluster, and based on which it grows amid stabilized knowledge interactions between the original two domains. The revelation of this convergence process contributes to the formation theory of emerging technologies that are inter-disciplinary, and is of great interest to researchers, policy makers, and industrialists.

AB  - In today’s environment of the rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI), debate continues about whether it has beneficial effects on economic development. However, there is only a fragmented perception of what role and place AI technology actually plays in economic development (ED). In this paper, we pioneer the research by focusing our detective work and discussion on the intersection of AI and economic development. Specifically, we adopt a two-step methodology. At the first step, we analyze 2211 documents in the AI&ED field using the bibliometric tool Bibliometrix, presenting the internal structure and external characteristics of the field through different metrics and algorithms. In the second step, a qualitative content analysis of clusters calculated from the bibliographic coupling algorithm is conducted, detailing the content directions of recently distributed topics in the AI&ED field from different perspectives. The results of the bibliometric analysis suggest that the number of publications in the field has grown exponentially in recent years, and the most relevant source is the “Sustainability” journal. In addition, deep learning and data mining-related research are the key directions for the future. On the whole, scholars dedicated to the field have developed close cooperation and communication across the board. On the other hand, the content analysis demonstrates that most of the research is centered on the five facets of intelligent decision-making, social governance, labor and capital, Industry 4.0, and innovation. The results provide a forward-looking guide for scholars to grasp the current state and potential knowledge gaps in the AI&ED field.

AB  - Maritime transportation is one of the essential drivers of the global economy as it enables both lower transportation costs and intermodal operations across multiple forms of transportation. Maritime ports are essential interfaces that support cargo handling between sea and hinterland transportation. Besides, in this area, environmental protection is becoming extremely important. Global warming, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions are all having a detrimental influence on the environment and will most likely continue to do so for future generations. Hence, there is a growing need to promote environmental sustainability in maritime-based transportation. The application of machine learning (ML), as one of the main subdomains of artificial intelligence (AI), can be considered a component within the process of digital transformation to advance green activities in maritime port logistics. Thus, this article presents the results of a systematic literature review of the recent literature on machine learning for promoting environmentally sustainable maritime ports. It collects and analyses the articles whose contributions lie in the interplay between three main dimensions, i.e., machine learning, port-related operations, and environmental sustainability. Throughout a review protocol, this research is constituted on the major focuses of impact, problems, and techniques to discern the current state of the art as well as research directions. The research findings indicate that the articles using polynomial regression models are dominant in the literature, and the recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) are the most recent approaches. Moreover, in terms of environmental sustainability, emissions and energy consumption are the most studied problems. mAccording to the research gaps observed in the review, two broad directions for future research are identified: (i) altering attention on a greater diversity of machine learning approaches for promoting environmental sustainability in ports and (ii) leveraging new outlooks to perform more green practical works on port-related operations.

AB  - Abstract Under framings of grand challenges, robotics has been proposed as a solution to a wide range of societal issues such as road safety, ageing society, economic productivity and climate change. However, what exactly is robotics research? From its inception, robotics has been an inherently interdisciplinary field, bringing together diverse domains such as engineering, cognitive science, computer science and, more recently, knowledge from social sciences and humanities. Previous research on interdisciplinarity shows that this mode of knowledge production is often driven by societal concerns and political choices. The politics of who gets to make these choices and on what terms is the focus of empirical research in this paper. Using a novel mixed-method approach combining bibliometrics, desk-based analysis and fieldwork, this article builds a narrative of interdisciplinarity at the UK’s largest public robotics lab, the Bristol Robotics Laboratory. This paper argues for the recognition of the plural ways of knowing interdisciplinarity. From citation analysis, through tracing of the emerging fields and disciplines, to, finally, the investigation of researchers’ experiences; each method contributes a distinct and complementary outlook on “what robotics is made of”. While bibliometrics allows visualising prominent disciplines and keywords, document analysis reveals influential and missing stakeholders. Meanwhile, fieldwork explores the logics underpinning robotics and identifies the capabilities necessary to perform the research. In doing so, the paper synthesises plural ways of locating politics in interdisciplinary research and provides recommendations for enabling “structural preparedness for interdisciplinarity”.

AB  - Fire detection is a critical safety issue due to the major and irreversible consequences of fire, from economic prejudices to loss of life. It is therefore of utmost importance to design reliable, automated systems that can issue early alarms. The objective of this review is to present the state of the art in the area of fire detection, prevention and propagation modeling with machine learning algorithms. In order to understand how an artificial intelligence application penetrates an area of fire detection, a quantitative scientometric analysis was first performed. A literature search process was conducted on the SCOPUS database using terms and Boolean expressions related to fire detection techniques and machine learning areas. A number of 2332 documents were returned upon the bibliometric analysis. Fourteen datasets used in the training of deep learning models were examined, discussing critically the quality parameters, such as the dataset volume, class imbalance, and sample diversity. A separate discussion was dedicated to identifying issues that require further research in order to provide further insights, and faster and more accurate models.. The literature survey identified the main issues the current research should address: class imbalance in datasets, misclassification, and datasets currently used in model training. Recent advances in deep learning models such as transfer learning and (vision) transformers were discussed.

AB  - Technological advancements in electronic storage have been trending for cloud computing. The revolution of this computer technology with machine learning and artificial intelligence has created prodigious platforms to the various disciplines of science and technology. Civil engineering is the oldest discipline, and due to the never-ending demand of this domain, it is rapidly adapting to newer computer techniques like image processing, deep learning, big data analysis, neural networks, building information modeling (BIM), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system, digital image correlation (DIC), and many more. In the current paper, we portrayed the primary research and achievements of AI and image processing applications in the civil domain. The paper is divided in two parts. The first part provides analysis of existing methods along with examples relevant to the civil domain where it is incorporated. The second part elaborates scientometric study constituting 605 documents (Science Direct database) published in the last two decades. The bibliometrics are further used for producing analytical frameworks based on publications, citations, top journals, top institutions, and funding sources. This study serves as a guide for readers to identify research gaps and use the review for potential future study.

AB  - Abstract Real‐world problems are becoming highly complex and therefore have to be solved with combinatorial optimization (CO) techniques. Motivated by the strong increase in publications on CO, 8393 articles from this research field are subjected to a bibliometric analysis. The corpus of literature is examined using mathematical methods and a novel algorithm for keyword analysis. In addition to the most relevant countries, organizations, and authors as well as their collaborations, the most pertinent CO problems, solution methods, and application areas are presented. Publications on CO focus mainly on the development or enhancement of metaheuristics like genetic algorithms. The increasingly problem‐oriented studies deal particularly with real‐world applications within the energy sector, production sector, or data management, which are of increasing relevance due to various global developments. The demonstration of global research trends in CO can support researchers in identifying the relevant issues regarding this expanding and transforming research area.

AB  - Abstract Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending uses two-sided platforms to link borrowers with a crowd of lenders. Despite considerable diversity in crowdlending research, studies in this area typically focus on several common research topics, including information asymmetries, social capital, communication channels, and rating-based models. This young research field is still expanding. However, its importance has increased considerably since 2018. This rise in importance suggests that P2P lending may offer a promising new scientific research field. This paper presents a bibliometric study based on keyword co-occurrence, author and reference co-citations, and bibliographic coupling. The paper thus maps the key features of P2P lending research. Although many of the most cited papers are purely financial, some focus on behavioral finance. The trend in this field is toward innovative finance based on new technologies. The conclusions of this study provide valuable insight for researchers, managers, and policymakers to understand the current and future status of this field. The variables that affect new financial contexts and the strategies that promote technology-based financial environments must be investigated in the future.

AB  - According to the World Health Organization forecast, over 55 million people worldwide have dementia, and about 10 million new cases are detected yearly. Early diagnosis is essential for patients to plan for the future and deal with the disease. Machine Learning algorithms allow us to solve the problems associated with early disease detection. This work attempts to identify the current relevance of the application of machine learning in dementia prediction in the scientific world and suggests open fields for future research. The literature review was conducted by combining bibliometric and content analysis of articles originating in a period of 20 years in the Scopus database. Twenty-seven thousand five hundred twenty papers were identified firstly, of which a limited number focused on machine learning in dementia diagnosis. After the exclusion process, 202 were selected, and 25 were chosen for analysis. The recent increasing interest in the past five years in the theme of machine learning in dementia shows that it is a relevant field for research with still open questions. The methods used to identify dementia or what features are used to identify or predict this disease are explored in this study. The literature review revealed that most studies used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its types as the main feature, accompanied by demographic data such as age, gender, and the mini-mental state examination score (MMSE). Data are usually acquired from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Classification of Alzheimer's disease is more prevalent than prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or their combination. The authors preferred machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Ensemble methods, and CNN because of their excellent performance and results in previous studies. However, most use not one machine-learning technique but a combination of techniques. Despite achieving good results in the studies considered, there are new concepts for future investigation declared by the authors and suggestions for improvements by employing promising methods with potentially significant results.

AB  - The momentum around computational thinking (CT) has kindled a rising wave of research initiatives and scholarly contributions seeking to capitalize on the opportunities that CT could bring. A number of literature reviews have showed a vibrant community of practitioners and a growing number of publications. However, the history and evolution of the emerging research topic, the milestone publications that have shaped its directions, and the timeline of the important developments may be better told through a quantitative, scientometric narrative. This article presents a bibliometric analysis of the drivers of the CT topic, as well as its main themes of research, international collaborations, influential authors, and seminal publications, and how authors and publications have influenced one another. The metadata of 1,874 documents were retrieved from the Scopus database using the keyword “computational thinking.” The results show that CT research has been US-centric from the start, and continues to be dominated by US researchers both in volume and impact. International collaboration is relatively low, but clusters of joint research are found between, for example, a number of Nordic countries, lusophone- and hispanophone countries, and central European countries. The results show that CT features the computing’s traditional tripartite disciplinary structure (design, modeling, and theory), a distinct emphasis on programming, and a strong pedagogical and educational backdrop including constructionism, self-efficacy, motivation, and teacher training.

AB  - Drug development is still a costly and time-consuming process with a low rate of success. Drug repurposing (DR) has attracted significant attention because of its significant advantages over traditional approaches in terms of development time, cost, and safety. Entitymetrics, defined as bibliometric indicators based on biomedical entities (eg, diseases, drugs, and genes) studied in the biomedical literature, make it possible for researchers to measure knowledge evolution and the transfer of drug research.The purpose of this study was to understand DR from the perspective of biomedical entities (diseases, drugs, and genes) and their evolution.In the work reported in this paper, we extended the bibliometric indicators of biomedical entities mentioned in PubMed to detect potential patterns of biomedical entities in various phases of drug research and investigate the factors driving DR. We used aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) as the subject of the study since it can be repurposed for many applications. We propose 4 easy, transparent measures based on entitymetrics to investigate DR for aspirin: Popularity Index (P1), Promising Index (P2), Prestige Index (P3), and Collaboration Index (CI).We found that the maxima of P1, P3, and CI are closely associated with the different repurposing phases of aspirin. These metrics enabled us to observe the way in which biomedical entities interacted with the drug during the various phases of DR and to analyze the potential driving factors for DR at the entity level. P1 and CI were indicative of the dynamic trends of a specific biomedical entity over a long time period, while P2 was more sensitive to immediate changes. P3 reflected the early signs of the practical value of biomedical entities and could be valuable for tracking the research frontiers of a drug.In-depth studies of side effects and mechanisms, fierce market competition, and advanced life science technologies are driving factors for DR. This study showcases the way in which researchers can examine the evolution of DR using entitymetrics, an approach that can be valuable for enhancing decision making in the field of drug discovery and development.

AB  - With the development of digital pathology and the renewal of deep learning algorithm, artificial intelligence (AI) is widely applied in tumor pathology. Previous researches have demonstrated that AI-based tumor pathology may help to solve the challenges faced by traditional pathology. This technology has attracted the attention of scholars in many fields and a large amount of articles have been published. This study mainly summarizes the knowledge structure of AI-based tumor pathology through bibliometric analysis, and discusses the potential research trends and foci.Publications related to AI-based tumor pathology from 1999 to 2021 were selected from Web of Science Core Collection. VOSviewer and Citespace were mainly used to perform and visualize co-authorship, co-citation, and co-occurrence analysis of countries, institutions, authors, references and keywords in this field.A total of 2753 papers were included. The papers on AI-based tumor pathology research had been continuously increased since 1999. The United States made the largest contribution in this field, in terms of publications (1138, 41.34%), H-index (85) and total citations (35,539 times). We identified the most productive institution and author were Harvard Medical School and Madabhushi Anant, while Jemal Ahmedin was the most co-cited author. Scientific Reports was the most prominent journal and after analysis, Lecture Notes in Computer Science was the journal with highest total link strength. According to the result of references and keywords analysis, "breast cancer histopathology" "convolutional neural network" and "histopathological image" were identified as the major future research foci.AI-based tumor pathology is in the stage of vigorous development and has a bright prospect. International transboundary cooperation among countries and institutions should be strengthened in the future. It is foreseeable that more research foci will be lied in the interpretability of deep learning-based model and the development of multi-modal fusion model.

AB  - [Context and Motivation] Many requirements prioritization approaches have been proposed, however not all of them have been investigated empirically in real-life settings. As a result, our knowledge of their applicability and actual use is incomplete. [Question/problem] A 2007 systematic review on requirements prioritization mapped out the landscape of proposed prioritization approaches and their prioritization criteria. To understand how this sub-field of requirements engineering has developed since 2007 and what evidence has been accumulated through empirical evaluations, we carried out a literature review that takes as input publications published between 2007 and 2019. [Principle ideas/results] We evaluated 102 papers that proposed and/or evaluated requirements prioritization methods. Our results show that the newly proposed requirements prioritization methods tend to use as basis fuzzy logic and machine learning algorithms. We also concluded that the Analytical Hierarchy Process is the most accurate and extensively used requirement prioritization method in industry. However, scalability is still its major limitation when requirements are large in number. We have found that machine learning has shown potential to deal with this limitation. Last, we found that experiments were the most used research method to evaluate the various aspects of the proposed prioritization approaches. [Contribution] This paper identified and evaluated requirements prioritization techniques proposed between 2007 and 2019, and derived some trends. Limitations of the proposals and implications for research and practice are identified as well.

AB  - Psychological well-being is a cornerstone of student success in higher education. However, many students struggle with mental health challenges like stress, anxiety, and depression during and even after the Covid-19 pandemic. These challenges, often stemming from academic, personal, social, or career concerns, negatively impact student learning and development. This underscores the need for robust support systems within higher education (HE). Artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a promising field in educational technology, offering students readily available guidance on their path to well-being. This research, guided by the PRISMA Statement 2015, provides an overview of AI applications in higher education through a systematic review. From an initial pool of 270 publications identified between year 2021 and 2023, finally, 24 articles met our inclusion criteria and were analyzed for the final synthesis. This paper revealed three key areas where AI-based systems can support student well-being: i) AI’s Advancement and Potential: Exploring the evolving capabilities and promise of AI in this context. ii) Building Effective AI Systems: Identifying crucial components for successful AI-based well-being interventions. iii) Barriers to Implementing AI in Higher Education: Addressing ethical considerations and challenges unique to academic settings. The conclusions and the road ahead from this research is the critical need for ethical, well-designed AI-based systems to overcome existing barriers and deliver exceptional student well-being support services. By prioritizing student mental health and providing them with the necessary tools and resources, we can empower them to achieve their full potential and thrive in their academic endeavors.

AB  - Abstract Scientometric methods have long been used to identify technological trajectories, but we have seldom seen reproducible methods that allow for the identification of a technological emergence in a set of documents. This study evaluates the use of three different reproducible approaches for identifying the emergence of technological novelties in scientific publications. The selected approaches are term counting technique, the emergence score (EScore) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We found that the methods provide somewhat distinct perspectives on technological. The term count based method identifies detailed emergence patterns. EScore is a complex bibliometric indicator that provides a holistic view of emergence by considering several parameters, namely term frequency, size, and origin of the research community. LDA traces emergence at the thematic level and provides insights on the linkages between emerging research topics. The results suggest that term counting produces results practical for operational purposes, while LDA offers insight at a strategic level.

AB  - Stylometry has gained great popularity in digital humanities and social sciences. Many works on stylometry have recently been reported. However, there is a research gap regarding review studies in this field from a bibliometric and evolutionary perspective. Therefore, in this paper, a bibliometric analysis of publications from the Scopus database in the stylometric research field was proposed. Then, research articles published between 1968 and 2021 were collected and analyzed using the Bibliometrix R package for bibliometric analysis via the Biblioshiny web interface. Empirical results were also presented in terms of the performance analysis and the science mapping analysis. From these results, it is concluded that there has been a strong growth in stylometry research in recent years, while the USA, Poland, and the UK are the most productive countries, and this is due to many strong research partnerships. It was also concluded that the research topics of most articles, based on author keywords, focused on two broad thematic categories: (1) the main tasks in stylometry and (2) methodological approaches (statistics and machine learning methods).

AB  - Shared mobility has emerged as a sustainable alternative to both private transportation and traditional public transport, promising to reduce the number of private vehicles on roads while offering users greater flexibility. Today, urban areas are home to a myriad of innovative services, including car-sharing, ride-sharing, and micromobility solutions like moped-sharing, bike-sharing, and e-scooter-sharing. Given the intense competition and the inherent operational complexities of shared mobility systems, providers are increasingly seeking specialized decision-support methodologies to boost operational efficiency. While recent research indicates that advanced machine learning methods can tackle the intricate challenges in shared mobility management decisions, a thorough evaluation of existing research is essential to fully grasp its potential and pinpoint areas needing further exploration. This paper presents a systematic literature review that specifically targets the application of Machine Learning for decision-making in Shared Mobility Systems. Our review underscores that Machine Learning offers methodological solutions to specific management challenges crucial for the effective operation of Shared Mobility Systems. We delve into the methods and datasets employed, spotlight research trends, and pinpoint research gaps. Our findings culminate in a comprehensive framework of Machine Learning techniques designed to bolster managerial decision-making in addressing challenges specific to Shared Mobility across various levels.

AB  - This paper addresses the important question of how research can support the implementation of the United Nations 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) set out in the 2030 agenda. Much attention on this topic has so far coalesced around understanding and measuring possible synergies and trade-offs that emerge in the SDGs. We contribute to this discussion by arguing that it is necessary to move towards a focus on how SDGs are enabling transformative change. A conceptual approach is presented based on the notion that research should build bridges across three types of SDGs: ones that reflect socio-technical system change, directionality, and framework conditions. This proposition is explored empirically through a case study of Mexican scientific knowledge production using methods from bibliometric and social network analysis. Our results can help to provide a diagnostic of how knowledge production is contributing to the SDGs and can be used in science, technology and innovation policy, in particular transformative innovation policy.

AB  - Does academic economic research produce material of general scientific value, or do academic economists write only for peers? Is economics scholarship uniquely insular? We address these questions by quantifying interactions between economics and other disciplines. Changes in the influence of economic scholarship are measured here by the frequency with which other disciplines cite papers in economics journals. We document a clear rise in the extramural influence of economic research, while also showing that economics is increasingly likely to reference other social sciences. A breakdown of extramural citations by economics fields shows broad field influence. Differentiating between theoretical and empirical papers classified using machine learning, we see that much of the rise in economics’ extramural influence reflects growth in citations to empirical work. This growth parallels an increase in the share of empirical cites within economics. At the same time, some disciplines that primarily cite economic theory have also recently increased citations of economics scholarship. ( JEL A11, A14)

AB  - Infection in apple leaves is typically brought on by unanticipated weather conditions such as rain, hailstorms, draughts, and fog. As a direct consequence of this, the farmers suffer a significant loss of productivity. It is essential to be able to identify apple leaf diseases in advance in order to prevent the occurrence of this disease and minimise losses to productivity caused by it. The research offers a bibliometric analysis of the effectiveness of artificial intelligence in diagnosing diseases affecting apple leaves. The study provides a bibliometric evaluation of apple leaf disease detection using artificial intelligence. Through an analysis of broad current developments, publication and citation structures, ownership and cooperation patterns, bibliographic coupling, productivity patterns, and other characteristics, this scientometric study seeks to discover apple diseases. Nevertheless, numerous exploratory, conceptual, and empirical studies have concentrated on the identification of apple illnesses. However, given that disease detection is not confined to a single field of study, there have been very few attempts to create an extensive science map of transdisciplinary studies. In bibliometric assessments, it is important to take into account the growing amount of research on this subject. The study synthesises knowledge structures to determine the trend in the research topic. A scientometric analysis was performed on a sample of 214 documents in the subject of identifying apple leaf disease using a scientific search technique on the Scopus database for the years 2011-2022. In order to conduct the study, the Bibliometrix suite's VOSviewer and the web-based Biblioshiny software were also utilised. Important journals, authors, nations, articles, and subjects were chosen using the automated workflow of the software. Furthermore, citation and co-citation checks were performed along with social network analysis. In addition to the intellectual and social organisation of the meadow, this investigation reveals the conceptual structure of the area. It contributes to the body of literature by giving academics and practitioners a strong conceptual framework on which to base their search for solutions and by making perceptive recommendations for potential future research areas.

AB  - Abstract The purpose was to investigate the impact of the Industry 5.0 paradigm on the supply chain research field. Our study contributes to the conceptualization of supply chain 5.0, a term that has been receiving increased attention as supply chains adapt to the fifth industrial revolution. We conducted a systematic literature network analysis (SLNA) to examine the research landscape of Industry 5.0 supply chains. We used VOSViewer software and Bibliometrix R-package for multiple bibliometric analyses using 682 documents published between 2016 and 2022. We present a comprehensive framework of supply chain 5.0, including its key concepts, technologies, and trends. Additionally, this research offers a future research agenda to inspire and support further development in this field. We utilized three academic databases for bibliometric analyses: Dimension, Scopus and Lens. Additional databases could provide a wider research landscape and better field representation. We demonstrate how Industry 5.0 enables supply chain evaluation and optimization to assist companies in navigating disruptions without compromising competitiveness and profitability and provide a unique contribution to the field of supply chain 5.0 by exploring promising research areas and guiding the transition to this new paradigm for practitioners and scholars.

AB  - The literature discusses data science (DS) as a very promising set of techniques and tools to support lean production (LP) practices. DS could aid manufacturing companies in transforming massive real-time data into meaningful knowledge, increasing process transparency and product quality information and supporting improvement activities through data-driven decision-making. However, no attempt has been made in the literature to formalise the links between DS and LP practices. Thus, this study aims to overcome this gap by clarifying the DS techniques and tools that can support LP practices and how to apply them. This study employs a quantitative bibliometric method – specifically, a keyword co-occurrence network analysis – on a set of papers extracted from Scopus. The results obtained allowed the researchers to identify a set of DS techniques and tools that can support LP practices and to develop a model to guide their implementation based on the typical improvement implementation stages of the plan-do-check-act cycle. The model shows how to use DS techniques and tools in LP for: identifying areas for improvement and subsequent implementation (plan); enabling a better knowledge and process management (do); identifying/predicting potential problems and employing statistical process control (check); providing remedial actions and effectively applying process improvement (act).

AB  - Our study provides valuable insights into the relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) and Human Resource Management (HRM). We have minimised bias and ensured reliable findings by employing a systematic literature review and the PRISMA statement. Our comprehensive synthesis of the studies included in this research, along with a bibliometric analysis of articles, journals, indexes, authors' affiliations, citations, keyword co-occurrences, and co-authorship analysis, has produced robust results. The discussion of our findings focuses on critical areas of interest, such as AI and Talent, AI Bias, Ethics and Law, and their impact on Human Resource (HR) management. Our research highlights the recognition by organisations of the importance of talent management in achieving a competitive advantage as higher-level skills become increasingly necessary. Although some HR managers have adopted AI technology for talent acquisition, our study reveals that there is still room for improvement. Our study is in line with previous research that acknowledges the potential for AI to revolutionise HR management and the future of work. Our findings emphasise the need for HR managers to be proactive in embracing technology and bridging the technological, human, societal, and governmental gaps. Our study contributes to the growing body of AI and HR management knowledge, providing essential insights and recommendations for future research. The importance of our study lies in its focus on the role of HR in promoting the benefits of AI-based applications, thereby creating a larger body of knowledge from an organisational perspective.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI)-based therapeutics, devices, and systems are vital innovations in cancer control; particularly, they allow for diagnosis, screening, precise estimation of survival, informing therapy selection, and scaling up treatment services in a timely manner.The aim of this study was to analyze the global trends, patterns, and development of interdisciplinary landscapes in AI and cancer research.An exploratory factor analysis was conducted to identify research domains emerging from abstract contents. The Jaccard similarity index was utilized to identify the most frequently co-occurring terms. Latent Dirichlet Allocation was used for classifying papers into corresponding topics.From 1991 to 2018, the number of studies examining the application of AI in cancer care has grown to 3555 papers covering therapeutics, capacities, and factors associated with outcomes. Topics with the highest volume of publications include (1) machine learning, (2) comparative effectiveness evaluation of AI-assisted medical therapies, and (3) AI-based prediction. Noticeably, this classification has revealed topics examining the incremental effectiveness of AI applications, the quality of life, and functioning of patients receiving these innovations. The growing research productivity and expansion of multidisciplinary approaches are largely driven by machine learning, artificial neural networks, and AI in various clinical practices.The research landscapes show that the development of AI in cancer care is focused on not only improving prediction in cancer screening and AI-assisted therapeutics but also on improving other corresponding areas such as precision and personalized medicine and patient-reported outcomes.

AB  - This study employs bibliometric analysis to evaluate 443 scholarly works on the topics of Indonesian Islamic banking published on 194 academic platforms, and authored by 1049 scholars. The machine learning tools i.e., R Studio and VOSviewer were employed to analyse the Scopus’ bibliographical data automatically harvested from the database. We developed four research questions based on the theories that are fundamental to bibliometric study, i.e., performance analysis, citation and co-citation analyses, bibliographic coupling and social network analysis, to identify the most impactful manuscripts, scholarly journals, authors, and institutions of affiliation. We further established the discussion of the current issues in Indonesian Islamic banking topics from the keyword analysis and the bibliographic coupling. These findings derive some recommendations for future research. This study provides a supply of scholarly novelty in the assessment of Indonesian Islamic banking publications which are both practically and theoretically importance to regulators, academia and industry professionals.

AB  - Abstract The design for manufacturing and assembly (DFMA) is a family of methods belonging to the design for X (DfX) category which goal is to optimize the manufacturing and assembly phase of products. DFMA methods have been developed at the beginning of the 1980s and widely used in both academia and industries since then. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, no systematic literature reviews or mapping has been proposed yet in the field of mechanical design. The goal of this paper is to provide a systematic review of DFMA methods applied to mechanical and electro-mechanical products with the aim to collect, analyse, and summarize the knowledge acquired until today and identify future research areas. The paper provides an overview of the DFMA topic in the last four decades (i.e., from 1980 to 2021) emphasizing operational perspectives such as the design phase in which methods are used, the type of products analysed, the adoption of quantitative or qualitative metrics, the tool adopted for the assessment, and the technologies involved. As a result, the paper addresses several aspects associated with the DFMA and different outcomes retrieved by the literature review have been highlighted. The first one concerns the fact that most of the DFMA methods have been used to analyse simple products made of few components (i.e., easy to manage with a short lead-time). Another important result is the lack of valuable DFMA methods applicable at early design phases (i.e., conceptual design) when information is not detailed and presents more qualitative than quantitative data. Both results lead to the evidence that the definition of a general DFMA method and metric adaptable for every type of product and/or design phase is a challenging goal that presents several issues. Finally, a bibliographic map was developed as a suitable tool to visualize results and identify future research trends on this topic. From the bibliometric analysis, it has been shown that the overall interest in DFMA methodologies decreased in the last decade.

AB  - Abstract While the emergence of big data raises concerns regarding governance and public policy, it also creates opportunities for diversifying the toolkit for analysis for the policy sciences as a whole, i.e., research concerning policy analysis as well as policy studies. Further, it opens avenues for practice, which together with research requires adaptation in teaching curricula if policy education were to remain relevant. However, it is not clear to what extent this opportunity is being realized in public policy research and teaching. In this study, we examine the prevalence of big data analytics in public policy research and pedagogy using bibliometric analysis and topic modeling for the former, and content analysis of course titles and descriptions for the latter. We find that despite significant scope for application of various big data techniques, the use of these analytic techniques in public policy has been largely limited to select institutions in a few countries. Further, data science has received limited attention in policy pedagogy, once again with significant geographic variation in its prevalence. We conclude that, to stay relevant, the policy sciences need to pay more attention to the integration of big data techniques in policy research, pedagogy, and thereby practice.

AB  - -One of the most widely used machine learning methods, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), is particularly useful for time series prediction. In this study, we carried out a bibliometric analysis against publications about LSTMs to identify trends and contributions of researchers in the development of machine learning technology. We collect bibliometric data from the Scopus database and use the bibliometric analysis method to analyze trends and contributions of researchers in publications about LSTM. Results of the bibliometric analysis show that LSTM is a lot used in related machine learning applications with time series data and is one the most popular technique for use in predictions. In addition, the use of LSTM is often combined with other deep learning methods, such as neural networks, to improve accuracy prediction. In addition, the results of the bibliometric analysis also show that the use of LSTM has spread to various fields, such as in handwriting recognition, processing Language experience, and recognition of a face. Implications from the results of this study are that the use of LSTM can provide solutions that are accurate and effective in solving prediction problems in various fields, especially in practical applications such as business, health, and transportation. The results of the LSTM bibliometric analysis can provide a broader view of trends and the contributions of researchers to the development of machine learning technology, as well as identify potential research areas for further development. Therefore, this research provides an important contribution to strengthening the results of previous research and showing that the use of LSTM has great potential in the development of future machine learning technology

AB  - With a text mining and bibliometrics approach, this study reviews the literature on the evolution of malware classification using machine learning. This work takes literature from 2008 to 2022 on the subject of using machine learning for malware classification to understand the impact of this technology on malware classification. Throughout this study, we seek to answer three main research questions: RQ1: Is the application of machine learning for malware classification growing? RQ2: What is the most common machine-learning application for malware classification? RQ3: What are the outcomes of the most common machine learning applications? The analysis of 2186 articles resulting from a data collection process from peerreviewed databases shows the trajectory of the application of this technology on malware classification as well as trends in both the machine learning and malware classification fields of study. This study performs quantitative and qualitative analysis using statistical and N-gram analysis techniques and a formal literature review to answer the proposed research questions. The research reveals methods such as support vector machines and random forests to be standard machine learning methods for malware classification in efforts to detect maliciousness or categorize malware by family. Machine learning is a highly researched technology with many applications, from malware classification and beyond.

AB  - Huge advances in peer-to-peer systems and attempts to develop the semantic web have revealed a critical issue in information systems across multiple domains: the absence of semantic interoperability. Today, businesses operating in a digital environment require increased supply-chain automation, interoperability, and data governance. While research on the semantic web and interoperability has recently received much attention, a dearth of studies investigates the relationship between these two concepts in depth. To address this knowledge gap, the objective of this study is to conduct a review and bibliometric analysis of 3511 Scopus-registered papers on the semantic web and interoperability published over the past two decades. In addition, the publications were analyzed using a variety of bibliometric indicators, such as publication year, journal, authors, countries, and institutions. Keyword co-occurrence and co-citation networks were utilized to identify the primary research hotspots and group the relevant literature. The findings of the review and bibliometric analysis indicate the dominance of conference papers as a means of disseminating knowledge and the substantial contribution of developed nations to the semantic web field. In addition, the keyword co-occurrence network analysis reveals a significant emphasis on semantic web languages, sensors and computing, graphs and models, and linking and integration techniques. Based on the co-citation clustering, the Internet of Things, semantic web services, ontology mapping, building information modeling, bioinformatics, education and e-learning, and semantic web languages were identified as the primary themes contributing to the flow of knowledge and the growth of the semantic web and interoperability field. Overall, this review substantially contributes to the literature and increases scholars’ and practitioners’ awareness of the current knowledge composition and future research directions of the semantic web field.

AB  - In recent decades, we have experienced a continuously increasing publication rate of scientific articles and related research objects (e.g., data sets, software packages). As this trend keeps growing, practitioners in the field of scholarly knowledge are confronted with several challenges. In this special issue, we focus on two major categories of such challenges: (a) those related to the organization of scholarly data to achieve a flexible, context-sensitive, fine-grained, and machine-actionable representation of scholarly knowledge that at the same time is structured, interlinked, and semantically rich, and (b) those related to the design of novel, reliable, and comprehensive metrics to assess scientific impact.To address the challenges of the first category, new technical infrastructures are becoming increasingly popular, organizing and representing scholarly knowledge through scientific knowledge graphs (SKG). These are large networks describing the actors (e.g., authors, organizations), the documents (e.g., publications, patents), and other research outputs (e.g., research data, software) and knowledge (e.g., research topics, concepts, tasks, technologies) in this space as well as their reciprocal relationships. These resources provide substantial benefits to researchers, companies, and policymakers by powering several data-driven services for navigating, analyzing, and making sense of research dynamics. Some examples include Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) (Sinha, Shen et al., 2015), AMiner (Tang, Zhang et al., 2008), Open Academic Graph (Sinha et al., 2015; Tang et al., 2008), ScholarlyData.org (Nuzzolese, Gentile et al., 2016), Semantic Scholar (Ammar, Groeneveld et al., 2018), PID Graph (Fenner & Aryani, 2019), Open Research Knowledge Graph (Jaradeh, Oelen et al., 2019), OpenCitations (Peroni, Shotton, & Vitali, 2017), and the OpenAIRE research graph (Manghi, Atzori et al., 2019). Despite their popularity, the field of SKGs has a lot of open challenges, such as the design of ontologies able to conceptualize scholarly knowledge, model its representation, and enable its exchange across different SKGs; the extraction of entities and concepts, integration of information from heterogeneous sources, identification of duplicates, finding connections between entities, and identifying conceptual inconsistencies; and the development of services that exploit knowledge as provided by one or more SKGs to discover, monitor, measure, and consume research outcomes (Aryani, Fenner et al., 2020; Auer, 2018).With regard to the second category, we seek effective and precise research assessment. In this context, there is a need for reliable and comprehensive metrics and indicators of the impact and merit of publications, data sets, research institutions, individual researchers, and other relevant entities. Research impact refers to the attention a research work receives inside its respective and related disciplines (Kanellos, Vergoulis et al., 2019), the social/mass media (Galligan & Dyas-Correia, 2013), and so on. A research work's merit, on the other hand, is relevant to its quality aspects (e.g., its novelty, reproducibility, compliance with the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable [FAIR] initiative for promoting data discovery and reuse, and readability). Nowadays, due to the growing popularity of Open Science initiatives, a large number of useful science-related data sets have been made openly available, paving the way for the synthesis of more sophisticated research impact and merit indicators (and, consequently, more precise research assessment). For instance, in recent years, due to the systematic effort of various developing teams, a variety of large SKGs has been made available, providing a very rich and relatively clean source of information about academics, their publications, and relevant metadata that can be used for the development of effective research assessment approaches (Chatzopoulos, Vergoulis et al., 2020).The proposal for this special issue originated from the collaboration of two workshops, the Scientific Knowledge Graphs Workshop (SKG 2020), and the Workshop on Assessing Impact and Merit in Science (AIMinScience 2020), held (virtually) in conjunction with the 2020 edition of the International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries (TPDL) on August 25, 2020. SKG 2020 offered a forum to discuss about the themes surrounding the first set of challenges, namely methods for extracting entities and relationships from research publications; data models for the description of scholarly data; methods for the exploration, retrieval, and visualization of scientific knowledge graphs, and applications for making sense of scholarly data. On the other hand, AIMinScience 2020 focused on the second set of challenges, which include scientometrics and bibliometrics; applications utilizing scientific impact and merit to provide useful services to the research community and industry; data mining and machine learning approaches to facilitate research assessment; and insightful visualization techniques that utilize or facilitate research assessment.Given that the themes of both workshops are interlinked, because SKGs can indeed support research impact assessment, it was a joint decision to edit this special issue on Scientific Knowledge Graphs and Research Impact Assessment, with the aim of providing all practitioners interested in the scholarly knowledge with the current advances of these particular aspects. In addition, this collaboration catalyzed the creation of the International Workshop on Scientific Knowledge: Representation, Discovery, and Assessment1 (Sci-K), a new joint event that replaced SKG and AIMinScience, focusing on a wider subject and audience. Sci-K aims to explore innovative solutions and ideas for the generation of approaches, data models, and infrastructures (e.g., knowledge graphs), for supporting, directing, monitoring, and assessing scientific knowledge. Its first edition, Sci-K 2021, was held on April 13, 2021, co-organized with The Web Conference 20212. It was a successful event with 11 presented papers and two keynote talks from Prof. Ludo Waltman and Prof. Staša Milojević.This special issue includes 10 contributions, equally balanced between advances on SKGs and research impact assessment. The papers in the first category introduce several innovative knowledge graphs that enrich classic metadata about articles, patents, and software with further information for exploring these documents more efficiently, identifying insights, and creating more comprehensive analyses of research trends. The articles on impact assessment propose new approaches for key challenges in this field, such as modeling the evolution of credit over time, citing data sets, analyzing research trends on social networks, and predicting citation-based popularity. The contributions address a variety of scientific domains, including computer science, phenomenon-oriented studies, opioids, and COVID-19. In the follow, we briefly summarize each contribution.Menin, Michel et al. (2021) introduce Covid-on-the-Web, a tool that assists users in accessing, querying, and sense making of COVID-19-related literature. In this effort, the authors first built a knowledge graph from the "COVID-19 Open Research Dataset" (Lu Wang, Lo et al., 2020), and then enriched it using entity linking and argument mining, finally providing an interface, the "Linked Data Visualizer" (LDViz), which assists the querying and visual exploration of the referred data set.Färber and Lamprecht (2021) introduce the Data Set Knowledge Graph (DSKG), describing the metadata of data sets for all scientific disciplines. In this knowledge graph, data sets are connected to the relevant articles, modeled in Microsoft Academic Graph (Sinha et al., 2015). DSKG is then further enriched with ORCID IDs and Wikidata.Angioni, Salatino et al. (2021) introduce the Academia/Industry DynAmics (AIDA) Knowledge Graph, which is generated with an automatic pipeline integrating data from MAG, Dimensions, English DBpedia, GRID, and Computer Science Ontology (CSO) (Salatino, Thanapalasingam et al., 2018). Currently, AIDA describes 21 million publications and 8 million patents according to the research topics drawn from CSO. In addition, 5.1 million publications and 5.6 million patents are also characterized according to the type of the authors, affiliations (e.g., academia, industry) and 66 industrial sectors (e.g., automotive, financial, energy, electronics).Buneman, Dosso et al. (2021) focus on two key challenges regarding citation graphs. The first is that citation graphs do not appropriately model the evolution of credit over time—for instance, when credit is assigned to the different versions of the same scientific work (preprint and peer reviewed). Usually, authors prefer that the citations of all versions receive are merged. The second challenge is the ability to cite data sets as a whole (single object) and also their constituents. To tackle these challenges, the authors suggest an extension of the current citation graph model, based on citable units and reference subsumption, which will improve the current practices for bibliometric computations.Kelley and Garijo (2021) present SOftware Metadata Extraction Framework (SOMEF), an approach to automatically extract scientific software metadata from its documentation, and specifically from the readme file. Next, they propose a methodology for structuring the extracted metadata within a knowledge graph of scientific software. Finally, they also provide a tool for browsing and comparing the contents of the generated knowledge graph.On the other hand, with regard to research impact assessment, Vergoulis, Kanellos et al. (2021) introduce BIP4COVID19, an open data set that offers a variety of impact measures for coronavirus-related scientific articles. These measures can be exploited for the creation or extension of added-value services aiming to facilitate the exploration of the respective literature. In the same context, as a use case, they also provide a publicly accessible keyword-based search interface for COVID-19-related articles, which leverages BIP4COVID19 data to rank search results according to the calculated impact indicators.Rothenberger, Pasta, and Mayerhoffer (2021) present an approach to analyze and measure the impact of phenomenon-oriented research fields. Specifically, they analyzed the field of migration research, which focuses on conceptualizing, capturing, and documenting an observed phenomenon (i.e., migration). In this analysis, to measure impact within such fields, the authors set up a framework to acknowledge scientific merit using a novel sophisticated citation factor.Haunschild, Bornmann et al. (2021) investigate which topics in opioid scholarly publications have received public attention on Twitter. The authors generate topic networks (i.e., networks of co-occurring author keywords), from both the tweets and from the publications that are tweeted by the accounts. The results showed that Twitter users tend to use more generic terms compared to those used within publications.Ghosal, Tiwary et al. (2021) proposed an automatic method that identifies significant citations, and then developed an approach to trace the lineage of given research via transitively identifying the significant citations to a given article. This approach can improve the retrievability of relevant literature, as well as finding the true influence of a given work in the scientific community beyond citation counts.Finally, Chatzopoulos, Vergoulis et al. (2021) focus on the problem of estimating the expected citation-based popularity (or short-term impact) of papers. State-of-the-art methods for this problem attempt to leverage the current citation data of each paper. However, these methods are prone to inaccuracies for recently published papers, which have a limited citation history. In this context, the authors introduce ArtSim+, an approach that can be applied on top of any popularity estimation method to improve its accuracy, providing more accurate estimations for the most recently published papers by considering the popularity of similar and older ones.Many people supported us in producing this special issue and we would like to take this opportunity to thank them.

AB  - Abstract The citation graph is a computational artifact that is widely used to represent the domain of published literature. It represents connections between published works, such as citations and authorship. Among other things, the graph supports the computation of bibliometric measures such as h-indexes and impact factors. There is now an increasing demand that we should treat the publication of data in the same way that we treat conventional publications. In particular, we should cite data for the same reasons that we cite other publications. In this paper we discuss what is needed for the citation graph to represent data citation. We identify two challenges: to model the evolution of credit appropriately (through references) over time and to model data citation not only to a data set treated as a single object but also to parts of it. We describe an extension of the current citation graph model that addresses these challenges. It is built on two central concepts: citable units and reference subsumption. We discuss how this extension would enable data citation to be represented within the citation graph and how it allows for improvements in current practices for bibliometric computations, both for scientific publications and for data.

AB  - The e-commerce industry's rapid growth, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has led to an alarming increase in digital fraud and associated losses. To establish a healthy e-commerce ecosystem, robust cyber security and anti-fraud measures are crucial. However, research on fraud detection systems has struggled to keep pace due to limited real-world datasets. Advances in artificial intelligence, Machine Learning (ML), and cloud computing have revitalized research and applications in this domain. While ML and data mining techniques are popular in fraud detection, specific reviews focusing on their application in e-commerce platforms like eBay and Facebook are lacking depth. Existing reviews provide broad overviews but fail to grasp the intricacies of ML algorithms in the e-commerce context. To bridge this gap, our study conducts a systematic literature review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) methodology. We aim to explore the effectiveness of these techniques in fraud detection within digital marketplaces and the broader e-commerce landscape. Understanding the current state of the literature and emerging trends is crucial given the rising fraud incidents and associated costs. Through our investigation, we identify research opportunities and provide insights to industry stakeholders on key ML and data mining techniques for combating e-commerce fraud. Our paper examines the research on these techniques as published in the past decade. Employing the PRISMA approach, we conducted a content analysis of 101 publications, identifying research gaps, recent techniques, and highlighting the increasing utilization of artificial neural networks in fraud detection within the industry.

AB  - Whenever natural and human-made disasters strike, the proper response of the concerned authorities often relies on search and rescue services. Search and rescue services are complex multidisciplinary processes that involve several degrees of interdependent assignments. To handle such complexity, decision support systems are used for decision-making and execution of plans within search and rescue operations. Advances in data management solutions and artificial intelligence technologies have provided better opportunities to make more efficient and effective decisions that can lead to improved search and rescue operations. This paper provides findings from a bibliometric mapping and a systematic literature review performed to: (1) identify existing search and rescue processes that use decision support systems, data management solutions, and artificial intelligence technologies; (2) do a comprehensive analysis of existing solutions in terms of their research contributions to the investigated domain; and (3) investigate the potential for knowledge transfer between application areas. The main findings of this review are that non-conventional data management solutions are commonly used in land rescue operations and that geographical information systems have been integrated with various machine learning approaches for land rescue. However, there is a gap in the existing research on search and rescue decision support at sea, which can motivate future studies within this specific application area.

AB  - Comprehensive data on research undertaken in cardiovascular medicine can inform the scientific community and can support policy building. We used the publication output from 2004 to 2013 and the 2014 references to these documents, to identify research topics and trends in the field of cardiovascular disease.Text fragments were extracted from the titles and abstracts of 478 000 publications using natural language processing. Through machine-learning algorithms, these text fragments combined to identify specific topics across all publications. A second method, which included cross-references, assigned each publication document to a specific cluster. Experts named the topics and document clusters based on various outputs from these semi-automatic methods. We identified and labelled 175 cardiovascular topics and 20 large document clusters, with concordance between the approaches. Overarching, strongly growing topics in clinical and population sciences are evidence-based guidance for treatment, research on outcomes, prognosis, and risk factors. 'Hot' topics include novel treatments in valve disease and in coronary artery disease, and imaging. Basic research decreases its share over time but sees substantial growth of research on stem cells and tissue engineering, as well as in translational research. Inflammation, biomarkers, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and lipids are hot topics across population, clinical and basic research, supporting integration across the cardiovascular field.Growth in clinical and population research emphasizes improving patient outcomes through novel treatments, risk stratification, and prevention. Translation and innovation redefine basic research in cardiovascular disease. Medical need, funding and publishing policies, and scientific opportunities are potential drivers for these evolutions.

AB  - Technology-driven Industry 4.0 (I4.0) paradigm combined with human-centrism, sustainability, and resilience orientation, forms the Industry 5.0 (I5.0) paradigm, providing support for the workforce and enabling the Operator 4.0 (O4.0) approach. The I5.0 focuses can face unforeseen challenges, as the applicability and readiness of I4.0 solutions are still not well discussed in the literature. Therefore, structuring existing knowledge of O4.0 to prepare for the smooth transition toward Operator 5.0 (O5.0) is crucial. A systematic literature review is performed in the Scopus database, considering publications up to 31 December 2022. Bibliography Network Analysis (BNA), text mining techniques (i.e., Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), BERTopic), and knowledge graph (KG) were deployed on the retrieved abstracts. The full-text examination is carried out over papers matched by LDA and BERTopic. From the BNA result of 279 relevant papers, clusters of active researchers and topics were found, while text-mining results revealed trending and missing research directions. The extracted details from the full text of 81 papers reflected the coverage and development levels of O4.0 types with the preparation for resilience, human-centrism, and sustainability. Achieved results suggest that though the O5.0 transition is inevitable, I4.0 technologies are not ready with sufficient human factor integration. Missing research orientations including integrated sustainability from the human perspective, or system resilience, concerning drivers and restrainers for technology adoption. To prepare for O5.0, discussed O4.0 drivers can help to shape the favorable conditions, and the restrainers should be mitigated before adopting human-centric technologies. Further study including grey literature is necessary to exploit more industrial and policy-making perspectives.

AB  - Abstract Depressive disorders (including major depressive disorder and dysthymia) and anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder or GAD) disorders are the two most prevalent mental illnesses. Early diagnosis of these afflictions can lead to cost-effective treatment with a better outcome prospectus. With the advent of digital technology and platforms, people express themselves by various means, such as social media posts, blogs, journals, instant messaging services, etc. Text remains the most common and convenient form of expression. Therefore, it can be used to predict the onset of anxiety and depression. Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases were used to retrieve the relevant literature using a set of predefined search strings. Irrelevant publications were filtered using multiple criteria. The research meta data was subsequently analyzed using the Biblioshiny Tool of R. Finally, a comparative analysis of most suitable documents is presented. A total of 103 documents were used for bibliometric mapping in terms of research outcome over the past years, productivity of authors, institutions, and countries, collaborations, trend topics, keyword co-occurrence, etc. Neural networks and support vector machines are the most popular ML techniques; word embeddings are extensively used for text representations. There is a shift toward using multiple modalities. SVM, Naive Bayes, and LSTM are the most used ML methods; social media is the most used source of data (Twitter is the most common platform); and audio is the most used modality that is combined with text for depressive and anxiety disorders (DAD) detection. Text data provides good cues for the detection of DAD using machine learning. However, the findings in most of the cases are based on a limited amount of data. Using large amounts of data with other modalities can help develop more generalized DAD-detection systems. Asian countries are leading in the research output with China and India being the top countries in terms of the number of research publications. However, more international collaborations are needed. Limited research exists for anxiety disorders. Co-occurrence of anxiety and depressive disorders is high (33% of studies).

AB  - Understanding the link between the energy-efficiency of buildings and climatic conditions can improve the design of energy-efficient housing. Due to global climate change and growing requirements for building energy-efficiency, the number of publications on climate zoning for buildings has grown over the last 20 years. This review attempted to give the reader an up-to-date assessment of the scientific literature in the field of climate mapping for buildings on a global and national scale, filling in the gaps of previous works and focusing on details that were not presented before. There were 105 scientific sources examined. The most dominant climate zoning variables were thoroughly analyzed. A clear categorization of climate zoning methods with specific criteria was shown. The most used methods were evaluated, emphasizing their similarities and differences, as well as their essential components and advantages. The main literature review was supported with bibliometric and bibliographic analysis. The existence of many climate zoning methods can be an indicator of the lack of agreement on the most effective strategy. A tendency has been established for the popularization among scientists of methods based on machine learning and building energy simulations, which are relatively easy to use and have proven to be the most reliable climate zoning methods. A transformation is emerging by shifting from a climate-based to a building performance-based climate zoning approach.

AB  - New models of entrepreneurship are emerging because of increasing digitalization and the development of artificial intelligence (AI). There is a lack of existing research on the intersection between digitalization and entrepreneurship. Therefore, this systematic literature analysis aims to expand knowledge in this area and provide a semantic analysis of existing contributions. Following the SPAR-4-SLR protocol, it analyzes 520 scientific articles from the Dimensions.ai database up to July 2022. The methodology uses natural language processing (NLP) and tools such as bibliometrix and VosViewer, which reveal the main characteristics of the titles and texts of the abstracts and their links with the numbers of citations and with scientific impact. This study provides guidelines and clear recommendations for scientists to focus their scientific research on AI and entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs by including the link between AI and entrepreneurship in their strategies. As future lines of research, the authors highlight the potential of using NLP in bibliometric analysis.

An analysis was undertaken of the 1051 brand personality-related articles published over the period 1987–2022 that are indexed in the Scopus scientific database. A bibliometric approach was adopted to systematically analyse the publications, and a performance analysis and science mapping were undertaken. The results showed that the motor themes of BP research related to its conceptualisation, dimensions and measurement, its impact on consumer-brand relationships and application in tourism destination-focused studies. Emerging BP-focused themes are its applications in virtual reality, artificial intelligence, service robots, storytelling and tourism segments, such as luxury. This study contributes by providing a better understanding of the state-of-the-art research on BP, and by identifying future research directions.

AB  - The advancement of science as outlined by Popper and Kuhn is largely qualitative, but with bibliometric data it is possible and desirable to develop a quantitative picture of scientific progress. Furthermore it is also important to allocate finite resources to research topics that have growth potential, to accelerate the process from scientific breakthroughs to technological innovations. In this paper, we address this problem of quantitative knowledge evolution by analysing the APS publication data set from 1981 to 2010. We build the bibliographic coupling and co-citation networks, use the Louvain method to detect topical clusters (TCs) in each year, measure the similarity of TCs in consecutive years, and visualize the results as alluvial diagrams. Having the predictive features describing a given TC and its known evolution in the next year, we can train a machine learning model to predict future changes of TCs, i.e., their continuing, dissolving, merging and splitting. We found the number of papers from certain journals, the degree, closeness, and betweenness to be the most predictive features. Additionally, betweenness increases significantly for merging events, and decreases significantly for splitting events. Our results represent a first step from a descriptive understanding of the Science of Science (SciSci), towards one that is ultimately prescriptive.

AB  - PURPOSE: The main purpose of this paper was to identify the current scope of research on cryptocurrencies as a subject of fraud. Detailed research questions related to the determination of contemporary trends of the conducted research and the definition of potential opportunities for further investigation of this topic. One of the questions also concerned identifying the most common crimes committed using cryptocurrencies. METHODOLOGY: The study is based on a systematic literature review (SLR) of 57 publications available on the Scopus database. A bibliometric and descriptive analysis of selected literature items was carried out. Then, vital thematic clusters were separated, and an in-depth content analysis was performed. FINDINGS: The detailed bibliometric and descriptive analysis showed that cryptocurrencies as a subject of financial fraud are generally a new area of scientific research, although it is developing quite intensively. The relatively small number of publications, compared to other similar areas, also indicates that this topic has not yet been explored widely by scientists, and many different research trends can be created in it. Ultimately, the following key research areas were identified: types of cryptocurrency fraud, crime detection methods, risks related to blockchain technology, money laundering, and legal regulations regarding cryptocurrencies. It was also possible to identify that money laundering is currently the most common fraud. However, it has been pointed out that the second most frequent fraud is financial pyramids based on the Ponzi scheme. IMPLICATIONS: The paper clearly presents the main research trends on using cryptocurrencies in criminal activities. At the same time, it was emphasized that, compared to other research areas, this topic is relatively new. Therefore, there is a wide possibility of exploring not only existing but also undiscovered research trends. In addition, key types of fraud in economic practice have been identified, which is particularly important for financial market participants. It was clearly indicated which transactions bear the highest risk. It is also worth paying attention to the critical timeliness of the topic, as the scale of crimes involving cryptocurrencies has recently been growing rapidly. The study confirms the insufficient scope of legal regulations, which are not able to strengthen the security of economic transactions adequately. Therefore, it can be a clear indication for the governments of individual countries or international institutions for further efficient changes to the law. ORIGINALITY AND VALUE: The contribution of this study is threefold. It is one of the first research papers showing the results of a systematic literature review (SLR) combined with a bibliographic and in-depth analysis of the content of publications in this field. During the work, the VOSviewer software was also used, which enabled objective identification of the main thematic clusters based on the occurrences and link strength of keywords included in the publications. Secondly, the key types of fraud have been identified that, at the same time, cause the most significant financial loss. This allowed for the establishing of directions for further research, which have profound practical implications for market participants. Some of them relate to the need to develop and implement modern computer applications, allowing for the detection of a wider range of emerging abuses.

AB  - Big Data research has rapidly developed in the last 10 years, making it an interesting topic to investigate to understand the trends and developments of Big Data in Education. This study aims to analyze source documents and state contributions, and visualize research trends on the subject of Big Data in education during the last 10 years and identify potential research topics related to Big Data in Education in the future. This study uses a literature review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method associated with bibliometric analysis using the Scopus and VOSViewer databases, through which 1,076 documents were obtained. The results of the bibliometric analysis show that Big Data research in education has increased significantly in the last 10 years. However, in the last year, it has decreased, this is the next challenge, and an opportunity for future research. The most common types of documents are conference papers, the source of most documents is conference proceedings, and the country that contributes the most is China. English is the most widely spoken language, and the authors with the highest contribution are Daniel, B. K. Further research related to Big Data can be used and implemented in the business world for Big Data analysis in education. Big Data can also be integrated with Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) which can be a further research opportunity that can be applied to education because analyzing Big Data requires STEM learning skills. Thus, this research recommends finding updates in the study of Big Data in education by integrating STEM in education because analyzing Big Data again requires STEM learning expertise. This study has limitations in using only one database, namely Scopus, to obtain research data. Therefore, it is recommended that Big Data in Education research be conducted using other databases besides Scopus to obtain more extensive data.

AB  - Research on supply chain (SC) digitalization, resilience, sustainability and leagility has remarkably progressed, most of it focused on the individual contributions of these four major frameworks. However, a lack of integration spanning these individual frameworks can be observed. In this conceptual paper, we hypothesize that reconfigurability can be considered such an integral perspective that consolidates the research in SC adaptation to ever changing environments. We theorize a new notion – a Reconfigurable SC or the X-network – that exhibits some crucial design and control characteristics for complex value-adding systems in highly vulnerable environments. We support our argumentation and conceptual viewpoints by a literature analysis along with tertiary studies to review and structure contextual factors of designing the X-networks. We propose respective frameworks and discuss the implementation principles and technologies at the macro and micro levels. Two novel concepts – dynamic SC meta-structures and dynamic autonomous services – are introduced. Distinctively, we go beyond the existing knowledge to predict proactively the future directions in the reconfigurable SCs. Our results can be of value for decision-makers to decipher chances and barriers in contemporary SC transformations.

AB  - The rising prevalence and global burden of diabetes fortify the need for more comprehensive and effective management to prevent, monitor, and treat diabetes and its complications. Applying artificial intelligence in complimenting the diagnosis, management, and prediction of the diabetes trajectory has been increasingly common over the years. This study aims to illustrate an inclusive landscape of application of artificial intelligence in diabetes through a bibliographic analysis and offers future direction for research. Bibliometrics analysis was combined with exploratory factor analysis and latent Dirichlet allocation to uncover emergent research domains and topics related to artificial intelligence and diabetes. Data were extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection database. The results showed a rising trend in the number of papers and citations concerning AI applications in diabetes, especially since 2010. The nucleus driving the research and development of AI in diabetes is centered around developed countries, mainly consisting of the United States, which contributed 44.1% of the publications. Our analyses uncovered the top five emerging research domains to be: (i) use of artificial intelligence in diagnosis of diabetes, (ii) risk assessment of diabetes and its complications, (iii) role of artificial intelligence in novel treatments and monitoring in diabetes, (iv) application of telehealth and wearable technology in the daily management of diabetes, and (v) robotic surgical outcomes with diabetes as a comorbid. Despite the benefits of artificial intelligence, challenges with system accuracy, validity, and confidentiality breach will need to be tackled before being widely applied for patients' benefits.

AB  - Abstract Background Bioinformatics has gained much attention as a fast growing interdisciplinary field. Several attempts have been conducted to explore the field of bioinformatics by bibliometric analysis, however, such works did not elucidate the role of visualization in analysis, nor focus on the relationship between sub-topics of bioinformatics. Results First, the hotspot of bioinformatics has moderately shifted from traditional molecular biology to omics research, and the computational method has also shifted from mathematical model to data mining and machine learning. Second, DNA-related topics are bridge topics in bioinformatics research. These topics gradually connect various sub-topics that are relatively independent at first. Third, only a small part of topics we have obtained involves a number of computational methods, and the other topics focus more on biological aspects. Fourth, the proportion of computing-related topics hit a trough in the 1980s. During this period, the use of traditional calculation methods such as mathematical model declined in a large proportion while the new calculation methods such as machine learning have not been applied in a large scale. This proportion began to increase gradually after the 1990s. Fifth, although the proportion of computing-related topics is only slightly higher than the original, the connection between other topics and computing-related topics has become closer, which means the support of computational methods is becoming increasingly important for the research of bioinformatics. Conclusions The results of our analysis imply that research on bioinformatics is becoming more diversified and the ranking of computational methods in bioinformatics research is also gradually improving.

AB  - This article elaborates on intellectual monopoly theory as a form of predation and rentiership using Amazon as a case study. By analysing Amazon’s financial statements, scientific publications and patents, we show that Amazon’s economic power heavily relies on its systematic innovations and capacity to centralize and analyse customized data that orients its business and innovations. We demonstrate how Amazon’s innovation activities have evolved over time with growing importance of technologies related to data and machine learning. We also map Amazon’s innovation networks with academic institutions and companies. We show how Amazon appropriates intellectual rents from these networks and from technological cooperation with other intellectual monopolies. We argue that Amazon, as other data-driven monopolies, predates value from suppliers and third-party companies participating in its platform. One striking characteristic of Amazon is the low rate of reported profits. The centrality of innovations leads us to suggest an alternative calculation that shows that Amazon’s profits are not as low as they appear in Annual Reports. We also argue that lower profits are coherent with Amazon’s rentiership and predatory strategy since they contribute to the avoidance of accusations of excessive market power. Finally, the paper offers preliminary observations on: (i) the complementarities between financial and intellectual rentierism and (ii) how data-driven intellectual monopoly expands big corporations’ political power. Going beyond the specific case of Amazon, we thus contribute to a better understanding of the role of lead firms and power dynamics within innovation networks.

AB  - Internet finance is a financial mode combining traditional financial industry with Internet technologies, which has become a crucial part of the financial field. Due to the rapid change of information technologies and public financial needs, Internet finance has produced quite a few specific operation modes, which have interested many scholars. To better appreciate its development process and innovation modes, we used bibliometrics to analyze 2,877 articles on Internet finance in Web of Science. Through the co-word network, co-citation network and various results generated by CiteSpace, we recognized six main modes of Internet finance, that is, Internet bank, peer to peer lending (P2P lending), crowdfunding, big data finance, digital currency and fintech. Emerging research topics and the development history of each mode are also detected. We find that the mainstream modes in current research are P2P lending and crowdfunding and the research on fintech and digital currency has just begun. Through the review, we also suggest some research directions for the research direction of each mode. These results will help to deepen relevant scholars’ understanding of Internet finance and provide guidance for them to choose research directions.

AB  - Abstract The high theoretical capacity of Li-O 2 batteries attracts a lot of attention and this field has expanded significantly in the last two decades. In a more general way, the large number of articles being published daily makes it difficult for researchers to keep track of the progress in science. Here we develop a text mining program in an attempt to facilitate the process of reviewing the literature published in a scientific field and apply it to Li-O 2 batteries. We analyze over 1800 articles and use the text mining program to extract reported discharge capacities, for the first time, which allows us to show the clear progress made in recent years. In this paper, we focus on three main challenges of Li-O 2 batteries, namely the stability-cyclability, the low practical capacity and the rate capability. Indeed, according to our text mining program, articles dealing with these issues represent 86% of the literature published in the field. For each topic, we provide a bibliometric analysis of the literature before focusing on a few key articles which allow us to get insights into the physics and chemistry of such systems. We believe that text mining can help readers find breakthrough papers in a field (e.g. by identifying papers reporting much higher performances) and follow the developments made at the state of the art (e.g. by showing trends in the numbers of papers published—a decline in a given topic probably being the sign of limitations). With the progress of text mining algorithms in the future, the process of reviewing a scientific field is likely to become more and more automated, making it easier for researchers to get the ‘big picture’ in an unfamiliar scientific field.

AB  - Abstract In an omnichannel era, businesses and marketers need insights into the dynamics of customer shopping behaviors, particularly the interplay between omnichannel, showrooming, and webrooming behaviors. This study investigates the evolution and trends of the research and channel shopping behaviors (RCSB) domain, spanning from 1998 to 2022, including the Covid‐19 era. The study performed a bibliometric review of 500 papers in the Scopus database. The performance analysis reveals an annual growth rate of nearly 16%, with average citations per document of 44, indicating sustained and growing research interest. Science mapping revealed five distinct cluster themes, including showrooming and webrooming in multi‐ and omni‐channel contexts; consumer behavior in online retail and shopping; customer satisfaction and trust in multi‐channel retailing; mobile commerce in a multi‐channel environment; and the interplay between online shopping, channel choice, and supply chain management. Furthermore, topics, such as showrooming, e‐commerce, retailing, and omnichannel retailing, remain popular before and during the pandemic, as seen in the thematic evolution. Our examination of the thematic maps revealed various topics that gained significance during the pandemic, such as multichannel, channel choice, customer experience, social commerce, purchase behavior, and covid‐19. Among these, the thematic maps indicate that customer experience, channel choice, multichannel, and covid‐19 are emerging and basic topics. These topics can steer research directions in the RCSB domain toward examining customer experiences using digital innovations, e‐commerce (including mobile and social commerce), and omnichannel strategy and management.

AB  - In this study, we review 1830 research articles on artificial intelligence in education (AIED), with the aim of providing a holistic picture of the knowledge evolution in this interdisciplinary research field from 2010 to 2019. A novel three-step approach in the analysis of the keyword co-occurrence networks (KCN) is proposed to identify the knowledge structure, knowledge clusters and trending keywords within AIED over time. The results reveal considerable research diversity in the AIED field, centering around two sustained themes: intelligent tutoring systems (2010-19) and massive open online courses (since 2014). The focal educational concerns reflected in AIED research are: (1) online learning; (2) game-based learning; (3) collaborative learning; (4) assessment; (5) affect; (6) engagement; and (7) learning design. The highly connected keywords relevant to analytic techniques within this field include natural language processing, educational data mining, learning analytics and machine learning. Neural network, deep learning, eye tracking, and personalized learning are trending keywords in this field as they have emerged with key structural roles in the latest two-year period analyzed. This is the first article providing a systematic review of a large body of literature on artificial intelligence in education, and in it we uncover the underlying patterns of knowledge connectivity within the field, as well as provide insight into its future development. The three-step multi-scale (macro, meso, micro) framework proposed in this study can also be applied to map the knowledge development in other scientific research areas.

AB  - This study aims to review the existing literature on audit and tax in the context of emerging technologies, besides providing future research agenda. A meta literature approach by combining bibliometric and content analysis was adopted to analyze 154 relevant English articles published in Scopus indexed journals, published over the last 35 years. Using RStudio, VOSviewer, and Microsoft Excel. Quantitative findings reveal that the USA is the top contributor and the most cited in the world. Brigham Young University, on the institutional level, is the most relevant affiliation. Concerning publication number, the Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting is the most relevant source. At the same time, the most cited source is the Decision Sciences journal. While the most prolific author is Miklos Vasarhelyi. Moreover, the emerging technologies, including big data, blockchain, and artificial intelligence, have significantly drawn accounting scholars interest from 2015 and thereafter. From the perspective of qualitative findings, the main focus shows that employing advanced technologies offers promising opportunities to mitigate the risk of tax evasion and enhance the auditors' efficiency. The content analysis reports two mainstreams tax and audit; each one is classified into three sub-streams, big data, artificial intelligence, and blockchain. This study contributes to present a clear and coherent understanding of the relevant exact literature and propose future research. However, the study review confines only on audit and tax fields, relying on the Scopus database.

AB  - This study focuses on agriculture, which is the main source of economic growth in many West African countries. In recent years, conventional agriculture has undergone a remarkable evolution and digital technologies are widely used for different purposes. While the world is rapidly using advanced digital technologies to grow their agriculture, Africa seems to be lagging behind, especially West Africa. To know how to contribute effectively, it is important to know what is being performed about this issue. The objective of this study is to examine the state of digital agriculture in five countries, namely, Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, and Nigeria. The study consisted of an analysis of the scientific contributions of these countries and the cases of actual deployment. This is carried out by means of a bibliometric study based on data collected from the Web of Science and a comparative review of the technologies used in the target countries using data from several sources, such as IEEE, Scopus, Science Direct, Google Scholar, etc. The bibliometric analysis based on 3249 publications revealed that research interests have increased significantly since 2014. Climate change, machine learning (ML), and adoption have been the hottest topics of discussion and most of the organizations working on the topic are academic bodies. Moreover, a considerable amount of the scientific input was obtained from Nigeria, which is the most populous of the five countries considered. The survey on digital farming showed that publications in Nigeria that address deployment cases were focused on the internet of things (IoT), wireless sensor networks, blockchain, and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. In Ghana, practical cases of blockchain, AI, and big data deployment were observed, while Burkina Faso focused on IoT and AI. In Côte d’Ivoire and Benin, the deployment cases generally focused on AI.

AB  - In this systematic literature review (SLR), we use a series of quantitative bibliometric analyses to (1) identify the main papers, journals, and authors of the publications that make use of statistical analysis (SA) and machine learning (ML) tools as well as technological elements of smart cities (TESC) and Geographic Information Systems to predict road traffic accidents (RTAs); (2) determine the extent to which the identified methods are used for the analysis of RTAs and current trends regarding their use; (3) establish the relationship between the set of variables analyzed and the frequency and severity of RTAs; and (4) identify gaps in method use to highlight potential areas for future research. A total of 3888 papers published between January 2000 and June 2021, distributed in four clusters—RTA + HA + SA (SA, n = 399); RTA + HA + ML (ML, n = 858); RTA + HA + SC (TESC, n = 2327); and RTA + HA + GIS (GIS, n = 304)—were analyzed. We identified Accident Analysis and Prevention as the most important journal, Fred Mannering as the main author, and The Statistical Analysis of Crash-Frequency Data: A Review and Assessment of Methodological Alternatives as the most cited publication. Although the negative binomial regression method was used for several years, we noticed that other regression models as well as methods based on deep learning, convolutional neural networks, transfer learning, 5G technology, Internet of Things, and intelligent transport systems have recently emerged as suitable alternatives for RTA analysis. By introducing a new approach based on computational algorithms and data visualization, this SLR fills a gap in the area of RTA analysis and provides a clear picture of the current scientific production in the field. This information is crucial for projecting further research on RTA analysis and developing computational and data visualization tools oriented to the automation of RTA predictions based on intelligent systems.

AB  - Abstract Utilizing a dataset sourced from a higher education institution, this study aims to assess the efficacy of diverse machine learning algorithms in predicting student dropout and academic success. Our focus was on algorithms capable of effectively handling imbalanced data. To tackle class imbalance, we employed the SMOTE resampling technique. We applied a range of algorithms, including Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), as well as boosting algorithms such as Gradient Boosting (GB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), CatBoost (CB), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LB). To enhance the models' performance, we conducted hyperparameter tuning using Optuna. Additionally, we employed the Isolation Forest (IF) method to identify outliers or anomalies within the dataset. Notably, our findings indicate that boosting algorithms, particularly LightGBM and CatBoost with Optuna, outperformed traditional classification methods. Our study's generalizability to other contexts is constrained due to its reliance on a single dataset, with inherent limitations. Nevertheless, this research provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms for predicting student dropout and academic success. By benchmarking these algorithms, our project offers guidance to both researchers and practitioners in their choice of suitable approaches for similar predictive tasks.

AB  - Hourly solar radiation (SR) forecasting is a vital stage in the efficient deployment of solar energy management systems. Single and hybrid machine learning (ML) models have been predominantly applied for precise hourly SR predictions based on the pattern recognition of historical heterogeneous weather data. However, the integration of ML models has not been fully investigated in terms of overcoming irregularities in weather data that may degrade the forecasting accuracy. This study investigated a strategy that highlights interactions that may exist between aggregated prediction values. In the first investigation stage, a comparative analysis was conducted utilizing three different ML models including support vector machine (SVM) regression, long short-term memory (LSTM), and multilayer artificial neural networks (MLANN) to provide insights into their relative strengths and weaknesses for SR forecasting. The comparison showed the proposed LSTM model had the greatest contribution to the overall prediction of six different SR profiles from numerous sites in Morocco. To validate the stability of the proposed LSTM, Taylor diagrams, violin plots, and Kruskal–Wallis (KW) tests were also utilized to determine the robustness of the model’s performance. Secondly, the analysis found coupling the models outputs with aggregation techniques can significantly improve the forecasting accuracy. Accordingly, a novel aggerated model that integrates the forecasting outputs of LSTM, SVM, MLANN with Sugeno λ-measure and Sugeno integral named (SLSM) was proposed. The proposed SLSM provides spatially and temporary interactions of information that are characterized by uncertainty, emphasizing the importance of the aggregation function in mitigating irregularities associated with SR data and achieving an hourly time scale forecasting accuracy with improvement of 11.7 W/m2.

AB  - Abstract The United Nations launched sustainable development goals in 2015 that include goals for sustainable energy. From global energy consumption, households consume 20–30% of energy in Europe, North America and Asia; furthermore, the overall global energy consumption has steadily increased in the recent decades. Consequently, to meet the increased energy demand and to promote efficient energy consumption, there is a persistent need to develop applications enhancing utilization of energy in buildings. However, despite the potential significance of AI in this area, few surveys have systematically categorized these applications. Therefore, this paper presents a systematic review of the literature, and then creates a novel taxonomy for applications of smart building energy utilization. The contributions of this paper are (a) a systematic review of applications and machine learning methods for smart building energy utilization, (b) a novel taxonomy for the applications, (c) detailed analysis of these solutions and techniques used for the applications (electric grid, smart building energy management and control, maintenance and security, and personalization), and, finally, (d) a discussion on open issues and developments in the field.

AB  - Increasingly, management researchers are using topic modeling, a new method borrowed from computer science, to reveal phenomenon-based constructs and grounded conceptual relationships in textual data. By conceptualizing topic modeling as the process of rendering constructs and conceptual relationships from textual data, we demonstrate how this new method can advance management scholarship without turning topic modeling into a black box of complex computer-driven algorithms. We begin by comparing features of topic modeling to related techniques (content analysis, grounded theorizing, and natural language processing). We then walk through the steps of rendering with topic modeling and apply rendering to management articles that draw on topic modeling. Doing so enables us to identify and discuss how topic modeling has advanced management theory in five areas: detecting novelty and emergence, developing inductive classification systems, understanding online audiences and products, analyzing frames and social movements, and understanding cultural dynamics. We conclude with a review of new topic modeling trends and revisit the role of researcher interpretation in a world of computer-driven textual analysis.

AB  - The incompleteness of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is a crucial issue affecting the quality of AI-based services. In the scholarly domain, KGs describing research publications typically lack important information, hindering our ability to analyse and predict research dynamics. In recent years, link prediction approaches based on Knowledge Graph Embedding models became the first aid for this issue. In this work, we present Trans4E, a novel embedding model that is particularly fit for KGs which include N to M relations with N ≫ M. This is typical for KGs that categorize a large number of entities (e.g., research articles, patents, persons) according to a relatively small set of categories. Trans4E was applied on two large-scale knowledge graphs, the Academia/Industry DynAmics (AIDA) and Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG), for completing the information about Fields of Study (e.g., ‘neural networks’, ‘machine learning’, ‘artificial intelligence’), and affiliation types (e.g., ‘education’, ‘company’, ‘government’), improving the scope and accuracy of the resulting data. We evaluated our approach against alternative solutions on AIDA, MAG, and four other benchmarks (FB15k, FB15k-237, WN18, and WN18RR). Trans4E outperforms the other models when using low embedding dimensions and obtains competitive results in high dimensions.

AB  - Background Automatic text summarization (ATS) enables users to retrieve meaningful evidence from big data of biomedical repositories to make complex clinical decisions. Deep neural and recurrent networks outperform traditional machine-learning techniques in areas of natural language processing and computer vision; however, they are yet to be explored in the ATS domain, particularly for medical text summarization. Objective Traditional approaches in ATS for biomedical text suffer from fundamental issues such as an inability to capture clinical context, quality of evidence, and purpose-driven selection of passages for the summary. We aimed to circumvent these limitations through achieving precise, succinct, and coherent information extraction from credible published biomedical resources, and to construct a simplified summary containing the most informative content that can offer a review particular to clinical needs. Methods In our proposed approach, we introduce a novel framework, termed Biomed-Summarizer, that provides quality-aware Patient/Problem, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO)-based intelligent and context-enabled summarization of biomedical text. Biomed-Summarizer integrates the prognosis quality recognition model with a clinical context–aware model to locate text sequences in the body of a biomedical article for use in the final summary. First, we developed a deep neural network binary classifier for quality recognition to acquire scientifically sound studies and filter out others. Second, we developed a bidirectional long-short term memory recurrent neural network as a clinical context–aware classifier, which was trained on semantically enriched features generated using a word-embedding tokenizer for identification of meaningful sentences representing PICO text sequences. Third, we calculated the similarity between query and PICO text sequences using Jaccard similarity with semantic enrichments, where the semantic enrichments are obtained using medical ontologies. Last, we generated a representative summary from the high-scoring PICO sequences aggregated by study type, publication credibility, and freshness score. Results Evaluation of the prognosis quality recognition model using a large dataset of biomedical literature related to intracranial aneurysm showed an accuracy of 95.41% (2562/2686) in terms of recognizing quality articles. The clinical context–aware multiclass classifier outperformed the traditional machine-learning algorithms, including support vector machine, gradient boosted tree, linear regression, K-nearest neighbor, and naïve Bayes, by achieving 93% (16127/17341) accuracy for classifying five categories: aim, population, intervention, results, and outcome. The semantic similarity algorithm achieved a significant Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.61 (0-1 scale) on a well-known BIOSSES dataset (with 100 pair sentences) after semantic enrichment, representing an improvement of 8.9% over baseline Jaccard similarity. Finally, we found a highly positive correlation among the evaluations performed by three domain experts concerning different metrics, suggesting that the automated summarization is satisfactory. Conclusions By employing the proposed method Biomed-Summarizer, high accuracy in ATS was achieved, enabling seamless curation of research evidence from the biomedical literature to use for clinical decision-making.

AB  - Collaboration has become an essential paradigm in sustainable development research and in strategies for meeting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study uses bibliometric methods and network analysis to examine research output and collaboration supporting the SDGs and explores means to detect and analyze research collaboration beyond the traditional definition of multiple, one-time co-authorship. We employed two additional lenses of collaboration: repeat collaboration and collaboration time point to quantify and visualize co-authorship data sourced from Microsoft Academic Graph. Our results show an increased collaboration rate over time at the author and institutional levels; however they also indicate that the majority of collaborations in SDG-related research only happened once. We also found out that on average, repeat collaboration happens more frequently, but after a longer duration, at the institutional level than at the author level. For this reason, we further analyzed institutions and identified core institutions that could help influence more consistent collaboration and sustain or grow the SDG-related research network. Our results have implications for understanding sustainable partnerships in research related to SDGs and other global challenges.

AB  - Floods can be caused by heavy rainfall and the consequent overflow of rivers, causing low-lying areas to be affected. Populated regions close to riverbeds are the sectors most affected by these disasters, which requires modelling studies to generate different scenarios. The work focuses on the bibliometric analysis of the search for topics such as flood modelling focused on the research, risk, and assessment of these catastrophes, aiming to determine new trends and tools for their application in the prevention of these natural disasters. The methodology consists of: (i) search criteria and database selection, (ii) pre-processing of the selected data and software, and (iii) analysis and interpretation of the results. The results show a wide range of studies for dimensional analysis in different flood scenarios, which greatly benefit the development of flood prevention and risk strategies. In addition, this work provides insight into the different types of software and modelling for flood analysis and simulation and the various trends and applications for future modelling.

AB  - Network models provide a general representation of inter-connected system dynamics. This ability to connect systems has led to a proliferation of network models for economic productivity analysis, primarily estimated non-parametrically using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). While network DEA models can be used to measure system performance, they lack a statistical framework for inference, due in part to the complex structure of network processes. We fill this gap by developing a general framework to infer the network structure in a Bayesian sense, in order to better understand the underlying relationships driving system performance. Our approach draws on recent advances in information science, machine learning and statistical inference from the physics of complex systems to estimate unobserved network linkages. To illustrate, we apply our framework to analyze the production of knowledge, via own and cross-disciplinary research, for a world-country panel of bibliometric data. We find significant interactions between related disciplinary research output, both in terms of quantity and quality. In the context of research productivity, our results on cross-disciplinary linkages could be used to better target research funding across disciplines and institutions. More generally, our framework for inferring the underlying network production technology could be applied to both public and private settings which entail spillovers, including intra- and inter-firm managerial decisions and public agency coordination. This framework also provides a systematic approach to model selection when the underlying network structure is unknown.

AB  - Increasing energy efficiency in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is becoming more important. An emerging approach to addressing this issue is to exploit development in data science and modelling. Deployment of sensors to measure various parameters in WWTPs opens greater opportunities for exploiting the wealth of data. Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a solution for automation and digitalization in the wastewater sector. This review aims to comprehensively investigate, summarize and analyze recent developments in AI methods applied to the modelling of WWTPs. The review shows that among the standalone models, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) was the most popular model followed by, in descending order: Decision Trees (DT), Fuzzy Logic (FL), Genetic algorithm (GA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). In the case of incomplete data, FL was the most frequently used method as it uses linguistic expert rules to find an approximation for the missing data. Regarding accuracy and precision, hybrid models demonstrated relatively better performance than the standalone ones. Among these models, the Machine Learning (ML)-metaheuristic, which integrates an AI model with a bioinspired optimization method, was the most preferred type as it was used in more than 45% of the hybrid models. Correlation coefficient (R), Correlation of Determination (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were the frequently used metrics for model performance evaluation. Finally, the review shows that despite recent developments, industrial deployment is still lacking. The industrial application requires close interaction of interested parties, among which research institutes, private sector and public sector play an inevitable role. The future research should focus on mitigating the barriers for more in-depth collaboration of interested parties and finding new paths for more cooperative and harmonized activity of them.

AB  - The concept of smart cities peaked in 2015, bringing an increased influx of ‘smart’ devices in the form of the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensors in cities. As a result, interest in smart urban governance has become more prevalent in administrative, organisational, and political circles. This is sustained by both local and global demands for an increased contribution to the goals of sustainability through urban governance processes in response to climate change urgencies. Cities generate up to 70% of global emissions, and in light of societal pressures for more inclusivity and democratic processes, the need for sound urban governance is merited. Further knowledge on the theme of smart urban governance is required to better understand the trends and knowledge structures and better assist policy design. Therefore, this study was undertaken to understand and map the evolution of the concept of smart urban governance through a bibliometric analysis and science mapping techniques using VOSviewer. In total, 1897 articles were retrieved from the Web of Science database over 5 decades, from 1968 to 2021, and divided into three subperiods, namely 1978 to 2015, 2016 to 2019, and 2020 to early 2022. Results indicate that the overall emerging themes across the three periods highlight the need for citizen participation in urban policies, especially in relation to smart cities, and for sustained innovation for e-participation, e-governance, and policy frameworks. The results of this study can aid both researchers exploring the concept of urban governance and policy makers rendering more inclusive urban policies, especially those hosting technological and digital domains.

AB  - Social media data have been widely used in natural sciences and social sciences in the past 5 years, benefiting from the rapid development of deep learning frameworks and Web 2.0. Its advantages have gradually emerged in urban design, urban planning, landscape architecture design, sustainable tourism, and other disciplines. This study aims to obtain an overview of social media data in urban design and landscape research through literature reviews and bibliometric visualization as a comprehensive review article. The dataset consists of 1220 articles and reviews works from SSCI, SCIE, and A&amp;HCI, based on the Web of Science core collection, respectively. The research progress and main development directions of location-based social media, text mining, and image vision are introduced. Moreover, we introduce Citespace, a computer-network-based bibliometric visualization, and discuss the timeline trends, hot burst keywords, and research articles with high co-citation scores based on Citespace. The Citespace bibliometric visualization tool facilitates is used to outline future trends in research. The literature review shows that the deep learning framework has great research potential for text emotional analysis, image classification, object detection, image segmentation, and the expression classification of social media data. The intersection of text, images, and metadata provides attractive opportunities as well.

AB  - Organizations are increasingly leveraging the ability of artificial intelligence to analyze and resolve complex problems. This can potentially reshape the interdependencies and interactions of complex systems, leading to our research question: To what extent and in which direction is the literature on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and System Dynamics (SD) converging within the business and management landscape? We conducted an extensive literature review using bibliometric and topic modeling methods to address this question. Through a bibliometric analysis, we identified the areas in which academic papers referred to both SD and AI literature. However, bibliometrics do not show a clear path towards convergence. The top modeling analysis highlights more details on how convergence is structured, providing insights into how SD and AI may be integrated. Two trajectories are identified. In the “soft convergence,” AI supports system dynamics analysis and modeling more deeply characterized by social interaction. In the “hard convergence,” AI shapes innovative ways of rethinking system design, dynamics, and interdependencies. Our analysis suggests that while soft convergence is more visible in the business and management landscape, hard convergence may well represent a new frontier in studying system dynamics with the potential to reshape the landscape.

AB  - In a wide range of industries and academic fields, artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly prevalent. AI models are taking on more crucial decision-making tasks as they grow in popularity and performance. Although AI models, particularly machine learning models, are successful in research, they have numerous limitations and drawbacks in practice. Furthermore, due to the lack of transparency behind their behavior, users need more understanding of how these models make specific decisions, especially in complex state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Complex machine learning systems utilize less transparent algorithms, thereby exacerbating the problem. This survey analyzes the significance and evolution of explainable AI (XAI) research across various domains and applications. Throughout this study, a rich repository of explainability classifications and summaries has been developed, along with their applications and practical use cases. We believe this study will make it easier for researchers to understand all explainability methods and access their applications simultaneously.

AB  - The scientific community is expanding by leaps and bounds every day owing to pioneering and path breaking scientific literature published in journals around the globe. Viewing as well as retrieving this data is a challenging task in today’s fast paced world. The essence and importance of scientific research papers for the expert lies in their experimental and theoretical results along with the sanctioned research projects from the organizations. Since scant work has been done in this direction, the alternative option is to explore text mining by machine learning techniques. Myriad journals are available on material research which throws light on a gamut of materials, synthesis methods, and characterization methods used to study properties of the materials. Application of materials has many diversified areas, hence selected papers from “Journal of Material Science” where “Materials and Methods” sections contains names of the method, characterization techniques (instrumental methods), algorithms, images, etc. used in research work. The “Acknowledgment” section conveys information about authors’ proximity, collaborations with organizations that are again not explored for the citation network. In the present articulated work, our attempt is to derive a means to automatically extract methods or terminologies used in characterization techniques, author, organization data from “Materials and Methods” and “Acknowledgment” sections, using machine learning techniques. Another goal of this research is to provide a data set for characterization terms, classification and an extended version of the existing citation network for material research. The complete dataset will help new researchers to select research work, find new domains and techniques to solve advanced scientific research problems.

AB  - Maritime transportation plays a critical role in global trade, and studies on maritime transportation safety management are of great significance to the sustainable development of the maritime industry. Consequently, there has been an increasing trend recently in studies on maritime transportation safety management, especially in terms of safety risk analysis and emergency management. Therefore, the general idea of this article is to provide a detailed literature review of maritime transportation safety management based on 186 articles in the Web of Science (WOS) database published from 2011 to 2022. The purposes of this article are as follows: (1) to provide a statistics-based description and conduct a network-based bibliometric analysis on the basis of the collected articles; (2) to summarize the methodologies/technologies employed in maritime transportation safety management spatiotemporally; and (3) to propose four potential research perspectives in terms of maritime transportation safety management. Based on the findings and insights obtained from the bibliometric and systematic review, the development of a resilient maritime transportation system could be facilitated by means of data- or intelligence-driven technologies, such as scenario representation, digital twinning, and data simulation. In addition, the issues facing intelligent maritime shipping greatly challenge the current maritime safety management system due to the co-existence of intelligent and non-intelligent maritime operation.

AB  - Bioinformatics, which has developed rapidly in recent years with the collaborative contributions of the fields of biology and informatics, provides a deeper perspective on the analysis and understanding of complex biological data. In this regard, bioinformatics has an interdisciplinary background and a rich literature in terms of domain-specific studies. Providing a holistic picture of bioinformatics research by analyzing the major topics and their trends and developmental stages is critical for an understanding of the field. From this perspective, this study aimed to analyze the last 50 years of bioinformatics studies (a total of 71,490 articles) by using an automated text-mining methodology based on probabilistic topic modeling to reveal the main topics, trends, and the evolution of the field. As a result, 24 major topics that reflect the focuses and trends of the field were identified. Based on the discovered topics and their temporal tendencies from 1970 until 2020, the developmental periods of the field were divided into seven phases, from the "newborn" to the "wisdom" stages. Moreover, the findings indicated a recent increase in the popularity of the topics "Statistical Estimation", "Data Analysis Tools", "Genomic Data", "Gene Expression", and "Prediction". The results of the study revealed that, in bioinformatics studies, interest in innovative computing and data analysis methods based on artificial intelligence and machine learning has gradually increased, thereby marking a significant improvement in contemporary analysis tools and techniques based on prediction.

AB  - Recently, developing automated video surveillance systems (VSSs) has become crucial to ensure the security and safety of the population, especially during events involving large crowds, such as sporting events. While artificial intelligence (AI) smooths the path of computers to think like humans, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) pave the way more, even by adding training and learning components. DL algorithms require data labeling and high-performance computers to effectively analyze and understand surveillance data recorded from fixed or mobile cameras installed in indoor or outdoor environments. However, they might not perform as expected, take much time in training, or not have enough input data to generalize well. To that end, deep transfer learning (DTL) and deep domain adaptation (DDA) have recently been proposed as promising solutions to alleviate these issues. Typically, they can (i) ease the training process, (ii) improve the generalizability of ML and DL models, and (iii) overcome data scarcity problems by transferring knowledge from one domain to another or from one task to another. Although the increasing number of articles proposed to develop DTL- and DDA-based VSSs, a thorough review that summarizes and criticizes the state-of-the-art is still missing. To that end, this paper introduces, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the first overview of existing DTL- and DDA-based video surveillance to (i) shed light on their benefits, (ii) discuss their challenges, and (iii) highlight their future perspectives.

AB  - International mobility in academia can enhance the human and social capital of researchers and consequently their scientific outcome. However, there is still a very limited understanding of the different mobility patterns among scholars with various socio-demographic characteristics. By studying these differences, we can detect inequalities in access to scholarly networks across borders, which can cause disparities in scientific advancement. The aim of this study is twofold. First, we investigate to what extent individuals' factors (e.g., country, career stage, and field of research) associate with the mobility of male and female researchers. Second, we explore the relationship between mobility and scientific activity and impact. For this purpose, we used a bibliometric approach to track the mobility of authors. To compare the researchers' scientific outcomes, we considered the number of publications and received citations as indicators, as well as the number of unique co-authors in all their publications. We also analyzed the co-authorship network of researchers and compared centrality measures of "mobile" and "non-mobile" researchers. Results show that researchers from North America and Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly female ones, have the lowest, respectively, highest tendency towards international mobility. Having international co-authors increases the probability of international movement. Our findings uncover gender inequality in international mobility across scientific fields and countries. Across genders, researchers in the Physical sciences have the most and in the Social sciences the least rate of mobility. We observed more mobility for Social scientists at the advanced career stage, while researchers in other fields prefer to move at earlier career stages. Also, we found a positive correlation between mobility and scientific outcomes, but no apparent difference between females and males. Indeed, researchers who have started mobility at the advanced career stages had a better scientific outcome. Comparing the centrality of mobile and non-mobile researchers in the co-authorship networks reveals a higher social capital advantage for mobile researchers.

AB  - Abstract Fraud, corruption, and collusion are the most common types of crime in public procurement processes; they produce significant monetary losses, inefficiency, and misuse of the public treasury. However, empirical research in this area to detect these crimes is still insufficient. This article presents a systematic literature review focusing on the most contemporary data-driven techniques applied to crime detection in public procurement. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) methodology was adopted to identify typical elements that lead to crimes in public contracting. We collected scientific papers and analyzed the selected research using the Scopus repository. We evaluated and summarized findings related to crime detection techniques based mainly on machine learning and network science, as well as studies using fraud risk indices. Some methodologies presented promising results in identifying crimes, especially those using labeled data and machine learning techniques. However, due to the frequent unavailability of pre-labeled data on past cases, analysis through network science tools has become more evident and relevant in exploratory research.

AB  - Literature-based discovery (LBD) aims to discover valuable latent relationships between disparate sets of literatures. This paper presents the first inclusive scientometric overview of LBD research. We utilize a comprehensive scientometric approach incorporating CiteSpace to systematically analyze the literature on LBD from the last four decades (1986-2020). After manual cleaning, we have retrieved a total of 409 documents from six bibliographic databases and two preprint servers. The 35 years' history of LBD could be partitioned into three phases according to the published papers per year: incubation (1986-2003), developing (2004-2008), and mature phase (2009-2020). The annual production of publications follows Price's law. The co-authorship network exhibits many subnetworks, indicating that LBD research is composed of many small and medium-sized groups with little collaboration among them. Science mapping reveals that mainstream research in LBD has shifted from baseline co-occurrence approaches to semantic-based methods at the beginning of the new millennium. In the last decade, we can observe the leaning of LBD towards modern network science ideas. In an applied sense, the LBD is increasingly used in predicting adverse drug reactions and drug repurposing. Besides theoretical considerations, the researchers have put a lot of effort into the development of Web-based LBD applications. Nowadays, LBD is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary and involves methods from information science, scientometrics, and machine learning. Unfortunately, LBD is mainly limited to the biomedical domain. The cascading citation expansion announces deep learning and explainable artificial intelligence as emerging topics in LBD. The results indicate that LBD is still growing and evolving.

AB  - At present, considering the novelty of Immersive Technologies (ImTs) associated with Digital Twin (DT), Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR) in the context of the metaverse and its rapid and ongoing development in Building Information Modeling (BIM), knowledge of specific possibilities and methods for integrating ImTs into building process workflows remains fragmented and scarce. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the research progress and trends of immersive technology-driven BIM applications, providing a helpful reference for understanding the current knowledge system and stimulating future research. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first attempt to use macro-quantitative bibliometric analysis and micro-qualitative analysis methods to explore the research topic of ImTs-driven BIM. This study obtains 758 related studies in the past decade, year 2013 to 2022, through a series of keywords from the Web of Science Core Collection database and uses VOSviewer software to conduct keywords co-occurrence analysis and overlay visualisation to visualise the relationship between ImTs and BIM, which contains six clusters, namely VR, Internet of Things (IoT), DT, 3D model, design, and AR. The macro-quantitative analysis on ImTs-driven BIM applications throughout all the stages of the building lifecycle reveals the themes, content, and characteristics of the applications across the stages, which tend to be integrated with emerging advanced technology and tools, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain, and deep learning.

AB  - One could think that bibliometric measurement of academic performance has always been digital since the computer-assisted invention of the Science Citation Index. Yet, since the 2000s, the digitization of bibliometric infrastructure has accelerated at a rapid pace. Citation databases are indexing an increasing variety of publication types. Altmetric data aggregators are producing data on the reception of research outcomes. Machine-readable persistent identifiers are created to unambiguously identify researchers, research organizations, and research objects; and evaluative software tools and current research information systems are constantly enlarging their functionalities to make use of these data and extract meaning from them. In this article, we analyse how these developments in evaluative bibliometrics have contributed to an extension of indicator-based research evaluation towards data-driven research analytics. Drawing on empirical material from blogs and websites as well as from research and policy papers, we discuss how interoperability, scalability, and flexibility as material specificities of digital infrastructures generate new ways of data production and their assessment, which affect the possibilities of how academic performance can be understood and (e)valuated.

AB  - Semantic enrichment of BIM models is a process designed to add meaningful semantics to the information represented in a building model. Although semantic enrichment provides a valuable opportunity for BIM technology to reach its full potential, it is considered an emergent field of research. As such, the body of knowledge on the subject is incomplete and lacks formal definition of the process, possible applications, contributions, and computational approaches. In this work, an extensive literature review is performed to begin forming the body of knowledge in this field. A bibliometric analysis of relevant publications is implemented to identify previously explored approaches and methods for enrichment. Papers describing previous work in the field demonstrate the application of semantic enrichment to building information stored in accordance to the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) schema as well as based on a web ontology. A detailed content analysis illustrates the benefits of semantic enrichment for various tasks in the BIM domain, including improvement of data exchange routines, design analysis and processing data obtained by remote sensing techniques. A formal definition for "semantic enrichment of BIM" is suggested based on the common features identified during the literature review. This work discusses the significance of semantic enrichment to a BIM workflow, pinpoints its current research gaps and describes direction for future research.

AB  - Automatic log file analysis enables early detection of relevant incidents such as system failures.In particular, selflearning anomaly detection techniques capture patterns in log data and subsequently report unexpected log event occurrences to system operators without the need to provide or manually model anomalous scenarios in advance.Recently, an increasing number of approaches leveraging deep learning neural networks for this purpose have been presented.These approaches have demonstrated superior detection performance in comparison to conventional machine learning techniques and simultaneously resolve issues with unstable data formats.However, there exist many different architectures for deep learning and it is nontrivial to encode raw and unstructured log data to be analyzed by neural networks.We therefore carry out a systematic literature review that provides an overview of deployed models, data pre-processing mechanisms, anomaly detection techniques, and evaluations.The survey does not quantitatively compare existing approaches but instead aims to help readers understand relevant aspects of different model architectures and emphasizes open issues for future work.

AB  - With the global outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) all over the world, artificial intelligence (AI) technology is widely used in COVID-19 and has become a hot topic. In recent 2 years, the application of AI technology in COVID-19 has developed rapidly, and more than 100 relevant papers are published every month. In this paper, we combined with the bibliometric and visual knowledge map analysis, used the WOS database as the sample data source, and applied VOSviewer and CiteSpace analysis tools to carry out multi-dimensional statistical analysis and visual analysis about 1903 pieces of literature of recent 2 years (by the end of July this year). The data is analyzed by several terms with the main annual article and citation count, major publication sources, institutions and countries, their contribution and collaboration, etc. Since last year, the research on the COVID-19 has sharply increased; especially the corresponding research fields combined with the AI technology are expanding, such as medicine, management, economics, and informatics. The China and USA are the most prolific countries in AI applied in COVID-19, which have made a significant contribution to AI applied in COVID-19, as the high-level international collaboration of countries and institutions is increasing and more impactful. Moreover, we widely studied the issues: detection, surveillance, risk prediction, therapeutic research, virus modeling, and analysis of COVID-19. Finally, we put forward perspective challenges and limits to the application of AI in the COVID-19 for researchers and practitioners to facilitate future research on AI applied in COVID-19.

AB  - Abstract By employing bibliometric method, this study aimed to visualize the research hotspots and correlations among clinical medicine subjects. Literatures were retrieved from the PubMed database based on MeSH words and free-text phrases and screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The disease themes were manually marked according to ICD-10. Co-word analysis and strategic diagram methods were applied to explore the hot topics and development trends of disease themes. 2551 articles were included after literature screening. The amount of paper showed an increasing trend and reached a peak in 2013. The subjects of adults and the elderly accounted for 45.0% and 27.0% respectively. The United States of America had the most publication, with Massachusetts and California being the most prevalent states, and Harvard University was the most prolific institution. Co-word analysis revealed that research hot topics of diseases were divided into 8 themes, among which the most was “disease of the circulatory system” and “injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes”. The strategic diagram showed that the above two topics were mature but relatively independent, while the “physical fitness” topic was not mature enough but was closely related to the others. There are more and more data-driven studies in the field of medicine and health, while, huge development spaces in the full spectrum of the diseases do exist. Mining the published researches through bibliometrics and visualized methods could come up with valuable results to inform further study.

AB  - Abstract In the past, several works have investigated ways for combining quantitative and qualitative methods in research assessment exercises. Indeed, the Italian National Scientific Qualification (NSQ), i.e. the national assessment exercise which aims at deciding whether a scholar can apply to professorial academic positions as Associate Professor and Full Professor, adopts a quantitative and qualitative evaluation process: it makes use of bibliometrics followed by a peer-review process of candidates’ CVs. The NSQ divides academic disciplines into two categories, i.e. citation-based disciplines (CDs) and non-citation-based disciplines (NDs), a division that affects the metrics used for assessing the candidates of that discipline in the first part of the process, which is based on bibliometrics. In this work, we aim at exploring whether citation-based metrics, calculated only considering open bibliographic and citation data, can support the human peer-review of NDs and yield insights on how it is conducted. To understand if and what citation-based (and, possibly, other) metrics provide relevant information, we created a series of machine learning models to replicate the decisions of the NSQ committees. As one of the main outcomes of our study, we noticed that the strength of the citational relationship between the candidate and the commission in charge of assessing his/her CV seems to play a role in the peer-review phase of the NSQ of NDs.

AB  - Decision support systems like computer-aided energy system analysis (ESA) are considered one of the main pillars for developing sustainable and reliable energy strategies. Although today's diverse tools can already support decision-makers in a variety of research questions, further developments are still necessary. Intending to identify opportunities and challenges in the field, we classify modelling topics into modelling capabilities (32), methodologies (15), implementation issues (15) and management issues (7) from an extensive literature review. Based on a quantitative expert survey of energy system modellers (N = 61) mainly working with simulation and optimisation models, the Status of Development and the Complexity of Realisation of those modelling topics are assessed. While the rated items are considered to be more complex than actually represented, no significant outliers are determinable, showing that there is no consensus about particular aspects of ESA that are lacking development. Nevertheless, a classification of the items in terms of a specially defined modelling strategy matrix identifies capabilities like land-use planning patterns, equity and distributional effects and endogenous technological learning as “low hanging fruits” for enhancement, as well as a large number of complex topics that are already well implemented. The remaining “tough nuts” regarding modelling capabilities include non-energy sector and social behaviour interaction effects. In general, the optimisation and simulation models differ in their respective strengths, justifying the existence of both. While methods were generally rated as quite well developed, combinatorial optimisation approaches, as well as machine learning, are identified as important research methods to be developed further for ESA.

AB  - Collaborative research is increasing in terms of publications, skills, and formal interactions, which certainly makes it the hotspot in both academia and the industrial sector.Knowing the factors and behavior of dynamic collaboration network provides insights that helps in improving the researcher's profile and coordinator's productivity of research.Despite rapid developments in the research collaboration process with various outcomes, its validity is still difficult to address.Existing approaches have used bibliometric network analysis with different aspects to understand collaboration patterns that measure the quality of their corresponding relationships.At this point in time, we would like to investigate an efficient method to outline the credibility of findings in publication-author relations.In this research, we propose a new collaboration method to analyze the structure of research articles using four types of graphs for discerning authors' influence.We apply different combinations of network relationships and bibliometric analysis on the G-index parameter to disclose their interrelated differences.Our model is designed to find the dynamic indicators of co-authored collaboration with an influence on the author's behavior in terms of change in research area/interest.In the research we investigate the dynamic relations in an academic field using metadata of openly available articles and collaborating international authors in interrelated areas/domains.Based on filtered evidence of relationship networks and their statistical results, the research shows an increment in productivity and better influence over time.

AB  - This study aims to provide a systematic and complete knowledge map for researchers working in the field of research on the application of artificial intelligence in education. In addition, it is designed to help researchers quickly understand author collaboration characteristics, institutional collaboration characteristics, trending research topics, evolutionary trends, and research frontiers of scholars from a library informatics perspective. In this study, a bibliometric approach was used to quantitatively analyze the retrieved literature with the help of the bibliometric analysis software CiteSpace. The analysis results are presented in tables and visual images in this paper. The results of this study indicate that collaborative relationships among scholars need to be improved and collaborative research relationships among research institutions are more fragmented. This study also points out the shortcomings of this study: Chinese educational researchers and practitioners still have a relatively vague understanding of some fundamental issues in the process of integration and development of AI and education. Therefore, this paper uses quantitative research methods such as bibliometrics and visualization pictures to systematically and intuitively reveal the research progress and trends on the application of artificial intelligence in education based on the published literature and to provide a reference for further research on this topic in the future.

AB  - The widespread use of business intelligence products, services, and applications piques the interest of researchers in this field. The interest of researchers in business intelligence increases the number of studies significantly. Identifying domain-specific research patterns and trends is thus a significant research problem. This study employs a topic modeling approach to analyze domain-specific articles in order to identify research patterns and trends in the business intelligence field over the last 20 years. As a result, 36 topics were discovered that reflect the field’s research landscape and trends. Topics such as “Organizational Capability”, “AI Applications”, “Data Mining”, “Big Data Analytics”, and “Visualization” have recently gained popularity. A systematic taxonomic map was also created, revealing the research background and BI perspectives based on the topics. This study may be useful to researchers and practitioners interested in learning about the most recent developments in the field. Topics generated by topic modeling can also be used to identify gaps in current research or potential future research directions.

AB  - Introduction: data science careers are on the rise due to the growing demand for technical skills in this area. Data science careers focus on collecting, organizing, and analyzing data to identify patterns and trends, which allows organizations to make informed decisions and develop effective solutions. Aim: to analyze the thematic specialization of institutions with academic programs in the area of data science. Methods: The Scopus database was used to conduct a bibliometric analysis aimed at examining the thematic specialization of institutions with academic programs in the field of data science. SciVal, a bibliometric analysis tool, was employed to extract the relevant data. The study period ranged from 2012 to 2021. Results: Nine higher education institutions were found to offer undergraduate or graduate degrees in the field of data science. There was no correlation found between RSI and Field-Weighted Citation Impact (r=0.05355; P=0.8912; 95% CI: -0.6331 to 0.6930). Therefore, it cannot be claimed that specialization in the subject area studied influences the greater impact of research. On the other hand, recent accreditation did not influence greater specialization (r=0.1675; P=0.6667; 95% CI: -0.5588 to 0.7484). Additionally, no differences were found regarding academic level. Conclusions: The analysis of the thematic specialization of institutions with academic programs in the field of data science shows low scientific production in this field. Moreover, more than half of the analyzed higher education institutions have thematic specialization below the global average. This suggests that there is still a long way to go for these institutions to achieve adequate specialization and compete internationally in the field of data science.

AB  - While using artificial intelligence in education is a popular field of study for researchers, it has become a joint application for educational institutions. Educational institutions are trying to establish artificial intelligence-based systems to improve the existing education systems. On the other hand, education researchers want to determine which artificial intelligence models are the most effective. To provide an in-depth resource for both researchers and educators on the use of artificial intelligence in education, this study aims to make a bibliometric analysis of articles related to artificial intelligence in education. After the query was made in the Web of Science database, 1153 articles related to the subject were obtained. As a result of the bibliometric analysis of the articles obtained, the most influential journals are Education and Information Technologies and Computers Education, and the most influential authors are Scouller, Biggs, and Hwang. After 2019, it has been observed that there has been a significant increase in the number of studies, the first examples of which were found in 1985. It is thought that this study, which provides results on the most cited publications, trending topics, thematic map of keywords, and co-occurrence network, will serve as a bedside resource for both educators and researchers. Implications of the findings for theory and practice are discussed.

AB  - Renewable energy forecasting is crucial for integrating variable energy sources into the grid. It allows power systems to address the intermittency of the energy supply at different spatiotemporal scales. To anticipate the future impact of cloud displacements on the energy generated by solar facilities, conventional modeling methods rely on numerical weather prediction or physical models, which have difficulties in assimilating cloud information and learning systematic biases. Augmenting computer vision with machine learning overcomes some of these limitations by fusing real-time cloud cover observations with surface measurements acquired from multiple sources. This Review summarizes recent progress in solar forecasting from multisensor Earth observations with a focus on deep learning, which provides the necessary theoretical framework to develop architectures capable of extracting relevant information from data generated by ground-level sky cameras, satellites, weather stations, and sensor networks. Overall, machine learning has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of solar energy meteorology; however, more research is necessary to realize this potential and address its limitations.

AB  - With the advent of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and electric vehicle (EV) technology, the research on the battery State-of-Charge (SoC) estimation has begun to rise and develop rapidly. In order to objectively understand the current research status and development trends in the field of battery SoC estimation, this work uses an advanced search method to analyse the literature in the field of battery SoC estimation from 2004 to 2020 in the Web of Science (WoS) database. We employed bibliometrics analysis methods to make statistics on the publication year, the number of publications, discipline distribution, journal distribution, research institutions, application fields, test methods, analysis theories, and influencing factors in the field of battery SoC estimation. With using the Citespace software, a total of 2946 relevant research literature in the field of battery SoC estimation are analyzed. The research results show that the publication of relevant research documents keeps increasing from 2004 to 2020 in the field of battery SoC estimation. The research topics focus on battery model, management system, LIB, and EV. The research contents mainly involve Kalman filtering, wavelet neural network, impedance, and model predictive control. The main research approaches include model simulation, charging and discharging data recording, algorithm improvement, and environmental test. The research direction is shown to be more and more closely related to computer science and even artificial intelligence (AI). Intelligence, visualization, and multi-method collaboration are the future research trends of battery SoC estimation.

AB  - Abstract The increasing interest from technology enthusiasts and organisational practitioners in big data applications in the supply chain has encouraged us to review recent research development. This paper proposes a systematic literature review to explore the available peer-reviewed literature on how big data is widely optimised and managed within the supply chain management context. Although big data applications in supply chain management appear to be often studied and reported in the literature, different angles of big data optimisation and management technologies in the supply chain are not clearly identified. This paper adopts the explanatory literature review involving bibliometric analysis as the primary research method to answer two research questions, namely: (1) How to optimise big data in supply chain management? and (2) What tools are most used to manage big data in supply chain management? A total of thirty-seven related papers are reviewed to answer the two research questions using the content analysis method. The paper also reveals some research gaps that lead to prospective future research directions.

AB  - This study shows the main results of a bibliometric analysis of academic research that has applied eye tracking technology in the marketing discipline, drawing from 923 documents extracted from the WoS bibliographic data-base. The aims of the study are to (i) identify the structure of the relationships between past and current research topics, (ii) provide a longitudinal perspective on eye tracking as a research tool for academics, covering the period 1992-2020, and (iii) identify emerging research trends for the future. Among other results, we find that the eye tracking methodology has been applied in marketing research particularly over the last decade due to scholarly interest in studying the visual attention of consumers and users in behavioral studies. More broadly, over the last 30 years, there are five major thematic areas identified: (a) brand-attention-modeling, (b) eye tracking-movements-communication, (c) web-online, (d) HCI-gaze-perception and (e) choice-labeling. The work is the first to identify the structure of the relationships between past and current research topics, and to predict future research trends in the marketing scholarship applying eye tracking as a research tool. Some limitations and potential future research themes are discussed at the end of the paper.

AB  - The escalating trends in energy consumption and the associated emissions of pollutants in the past century have led to energy depletion and environmental pollution. Achieving comprehensive sustainability requires the optimization of energy efficiency and the implementation of efficient energy management strategies. Artificial intelligence (AI), a prominent machine learning paradigm, has gained significant traction in control applications and found extensive utility in various energy-related domains. The utilization of AI techniques for addressing energy-related challenges is favored due to their aptitude for handling complex and nonlinear data structures. Based on the preliminary inquiries, it has been observed that predictive analytics, prominently driven by artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms, assumes a crucial position in energy management across various sectors. This paper presents a comprehensive bibliometric analysis to gain deeper insights into the progression of AI in energy research from 2003 to 2023. AI models can be used to accurately predict energy consumption, load profiles, and resource planning, ensuring consistent performance and efficient resource utilization. This review article summarizes the existing literature on the implementation of AI in the development of energy management systems. Additionally, it explores the challenges and potential areas of research in applying ANN to energy system management. The study demonstrates that ANN can effectively address integration issues between energy and power systems, such as solar and wind forecasting, power system frequency analysis and control, and transient stability assessment. Based on the comprehensive state-of-the-art study, it can be inferred that the implementation of AI has consistently led to energy reductions exceeding 25%. Furthermore, this article discusses future research directions in this field.

AB  - Coronavirus 2 virus is responsible for the spread of the infectious disease COVID-19 (also known as Coronavirus disease). People around the globe who got infected with the virus experienced a respiratory illness that could become as serious as leading someone to lose their life. However, the upside of the pandemic is that it has led to numerous types of research and explorations, majorly in the medical science field. Since a systematic survey of previous research activities and bibliometric analysis gives a brief idea about such contributions and acts as a reference to future research, this study aims to cover the research related to COVID-19 in the computer technology domain. It is limited to the works accepted and accessible with the keywords - Covid-19, prediction, and pandemic, in the Scopus search engine to justify the scope of this survey. Further, the paper highlights a few prior works used for predictive analysis and presents a quantitative angle on their algorithms. Earlier works showcase Time Series Analysis using ARIMA/SARIMA models for predicting the vaccination rates, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Xtremely Boosted Network (XBNet) Regression, and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for Confirmed, Cured, and Death cases. Amongst the algorithms used in the latter use case, XBNet regression performed better than XGBoost regressor.

AB  - Identifying and monitoring business and technological trends are crucial for innovation and competitiveness of businesses. Exponential growth of data across the world is invaluable for identifying emerging and evolving trends. On the other hand, the vast amount of data leads to information overload and can no longer be adequately processed without the use of automated methods of extraction, processing, and generation of knowledge. There is a growing need for information systems that would monitor and analyse data from heterogeneous and unstructured sources in order to enable timely and evidence-based decision-making. Recent advancements in computing and big data provide enormous opportunities for gathering evidence on future developments and emerging opportunities. The present study demonstrates the use of text-mining and semantic analysis of large amount of documents for investigating in business trends in mobile commerce (m-commerce). Particularly with the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and resultant social isolation, m-commerce has become a large technology and business domain with ever growing market potentials. Thus, our study begins with a review of global challenges, opportunities and trends in the development of m-commerce in the world. Next, the study identifies critical technologies and instruments for the full utilization of the potentials in the sector by using the intelligent big data analytics system based on in-depth natural language processing utilizing text-mining, machine learning, science bibliometry and technology analysis. The results generated by the system can be used to produce a comprehensive and objective web of interconnected technologies, trends, drivers and barriers to give an overview of the whole landscape of m-commerce in one business intelligence (BI) data mart diagram.

AB  - The Proceedings of the Ecological Society of New Zealand (PESNZ) and its continuation, the New Zealand Journal of Ecology (NZJE), published more than 1250 articles over the 58 years from 1961-2019.Over this period, the emphasis of ecology as a science and the social context in which it is embedded have changed.Here we provide a bibliometric analysis of the history of the PESNZ and the NZJE to assess how the dominant research themes have changed through time, and the extent to which they reflect broader trends in the policy and funding landscapes.The journals' consistent focus has been on applied ecological issues, especially the effects and control of invasive mammals.However, the most discussed taxa have shifted over time (from deer to brushtail possums to rodents and mustelids).Collaboration has altered dramatically, with few author networks and single-author articles in early issues versus multi-author articles and widespread networks today.Thus, the research published by the Society reflects NZ-specific concerns and broader trends in knowledge production (e.g. the shift to team-based science).We conclude by considering the publications of the NZ Ecological Society through the lens of journals being 'clubs' for the social production of shared knowledge.

AB  - Until recently, comprehensive scientometrics data has been made available only in siloed, subscription-based tools that are inaccessible to researchers who lack institutional support and resources. As a result of limited data access, research evaluation practices have focused upon basic indicators that only take publications and their citation rates into account. This has blocked innovation on many fronts. Dimensions is a database that links and contextualizes different research information objects. It brings together data describing and linking awarded grants, clinical trials, patents, and policy documents, as well as altmetric information, alongside traditional publications and citations data. This article describes the approach that Digital Science is taking to support the scientometric community, together with the various Dimensions tools available to researchers who wish to use Dimensions data in their research at no cost.

AB  - Contemporary technologies have ensured the availability of high-quality research data shared over the Internet. This has resulted in a tremendous availability of research literature, which keeps evolving itself. Thus, identification of core research areas and trends in such ever-evolving literature is not only challenging but interesting too. An empirical overview of contemporary machine learning methods, which have the potential to expedite evidence synthesis within research literature, has been explained. This manuscript proposes Simulating Expert comprehension for Analyzing Research trends (SEAR) framework, which can perform subjective and quantitative investigation over enormous literature. TRENDMINER is the use case designed exclusively for the SEAR framework. TRENDMINER uncovered the intellectual structure of a corpus of 444 abstracts of research articles (published during 2010–2019) on Android malware analysis and detection. The study concludes with the identification of three core research areas, twenty-seven research trends. The study also suggests the potential future research directions.

AB  - In the context of global joint response to climate change, carbon neutralization has become one of the main measures for governments, enterprises, and even individuals around the world to deal with global warming. This article explores the current research status and frontier trends in the field of carbon neutralization, which can not only provide theoretical reference for the follow-up research of carbon neutralization but also provide useful ideas for the policy-making of carbon neutralization. The study is built on the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) Core Journals Database, the Chinese Social Sciences Citation Index database, and the Chinese Science Citation Database as the literature retrieval database platform. Using CiteSpace optical measurement software, 370 pieces of literature in the field of carbon neutrality research in China were systematically analyzed to track the situation and impact of research by various research institutions and prominent authors in China in this field and to analyze the research hotspots in this field, which is of great significance for the follow-up research of carbon neutrality. The research results show that 1) the number of publications in China’s carbon-neutral field has increased significantly with the change of years and has strong development potential. 2) Journals with many articles are more concentrated and are generally published in three journals: Natural Gas Industry, Proceedings of the CSEE, and Chinese Science Bulletin. 3) In terms of the major research institutions, the Institute of National Conditions of Tsinghua University, the School of Public Administration of Tsinghua University, the School of Grammar of Beijing University of Technology, and the Economic Development Research Center of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration have published more articles and muscular scientific research strength in the field of carbon neutrality. 4) In terms of the principal authors, four typical research teams have been set up: low-carbon economy, low-carbon cycle, carbon trading, sewage carbon neutrality, environmental science, and resource utilization, and the authors of each research team cooperate closely. 5) In the future, the research hotspots in China’s carbon-neutral field are still the themes of carbon emission reduction, green and low carbon, new energy, etc., and the research hotspots have begun to shift to the concept of development, from the very beginning of environmental protection and carbon emission reduction to the current new energy development. Carbon neutrality is currently a hot research field in China, and in the future, special attention should be paid to the full use of machine learning and extensive data mining to solve complex social, economic, and ecological problems. It is suggested that China should introduce the concepts of “common but differentiated responsibilities” and “consumer responsibility” in the international climate change negotiations in the formulation of carbon neutralization policies, so as to fully protect the right to the development of China’s underdeveloped regions and avoid the injustice caused by the blind formulation of carbon neutralization policies.

AB  - Though a relatively large number of studies on sustainable project governance (SPG) have been undertaken, the existing corpus of literature is bereft of a comprehensive review paper that scientometrically analyses the materials published hitherto and puts forward the research gaps and the corresponding future works to be conducted. To fill this knowledge gap, this study undertakes a bibliometric review and scientometric analysis by meticulously delving into the relevant body of knowledge of sustainable governance reported in different databases. From the results obtained using CiteSpace software, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) most of the keywords with high centrality rankings are related to the environment, (2) “participation” and “land use” are the most important clusters, (3) the United Kingdom and the United States are by far the most advanced countries in the concerned field, (4) the hot topics within the defined clusters are “industry”, “transition management”, “property rights”, and “natural resources”, and (5) the two salient keywords are “public participation” and “insight”. The attained findings lay out a solid foundation for researchers and practitioners towards fostering the area of SPG, by focusing on land use, community participation, politics, climate change, and the water–energy–food nexus and finding ways to tackle the elaborated shortcomings.

AB  - The study of the dynamics or the progress of science has been widely explored with descriptive and statistical analyses. Also this study has attracted several computational approaches that are labelled together as the Computational History of Science, especially with the rise of data science and the development of increasingly powerful computers. Among these approaches, some works have studied dynamism in scientific literature by employing text analysis techniques that rely on topic models to study the dynamics of research topics. Unlike topic models that do not delve deeper into the content of scientific publications, for the first time, this paper uses temporal word embeddings to automatically track the dynamics of scientific keywords over time. To this end, we propose Vec2Dynamics, a neural-based computational history approach that reports stability of k-nearest neighbors of scientific keywords over time; the stability indicates whether the keywords are taking new neighborhood due to evolution of scientific literature. To evaluate how Vec2Dynamics models such relationships in the domain of Machine Learning (ML), we constructed scientific corpora from the papers published in the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS; actually abbreviated NeurIPS) conference between 1987 and 2016. The descriptive analysis that we performed in this paper verify the efficacy of our proposed approach. In fact, we found a generally strong consistency between the obtained results and the Machine Learning timeline.

KW  - Fake News
KW  - Rumor Detection
AB  - In today's world, being the easy availability of the internet, almost everyone is connected. Every individual for their daily news relies on online resources, which greatly impacts their quality of life. The development of social media platforms has grown tremendously. However, many of these platforms are spreading fake news that pauses serious concern. It leads to a decrease in income for individuals or companies. Some people often create fake news for gaining fame, for election purposes, and for creating hatred towards other companies to reduce their revenue. All these can have negative consequences on society. Just by the use of a single click, many people forward appealing headlines, photos, etc. to gain the attention of an individual, without even checking whether it is fake or not. It is hard-core truth that many false websites give false news and checking their authenticity is really a challenge. This paper presents a comparative analysis of methods for the user to check the news whether that's real or fake by providing accuracy and recall using machine learning. The models used are naïve Bayes (NB), decision tree classifier (DT), random forest (RF), and logistic regression (LR) for analysis to detect fake news. The result shows that the DT classifier achieved 99.56% accuracy as compared to RF (99.35%), LR (98.91%), and NB (94.89%). The recall also shows better results for DT and RF than LR and NB. Lastly, it discusses some of the security threats and challenges faced while detecting fake news.

AB  - With the increase in the amount and variety of data that are constantly produced, collected, and exchanged between systems, the efficiency and accuracy of solutions/services that use data as input may suffer if an inappropriate or inaccurate technique, method, or tool is chosen to deal with them. This paper presents a global overview of urban data sources and structures used to train machine learning (ML) algorithms integrated into urban planning decision support systems (DSS). It contributes to a common understanding of choosing the right urban data for a given urban planning issue, i.e., their type, source and structure, for more efficient use in training ML models. For the purpose of this study, we conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) of all relevant peer-reviewed studies available in the Scopus database. More precisely, 248 papers were found to be relevant with their further analysis using a text-mining approach to determine (a) the main urban data sources used for ML modeling, (b) the most popular approaches used in relevant urban planning and urban problem-solving studies and their relationship to the type of data source used, and (c) the problems commonly encountered in their use. After classifying them, we identified the strengths and weaknesses of data sources depending on several predefined factors. We found that the data mainly come from two main categories of sources, namely (1) sensors and (2) statistical surveys, including social network data. They can be classified as (a) opportunistic or (b) non-opportunistic depending on the process of data acquisition, collection, and storage. Data sources are closely correlated with their structure and potential urban planning issues to be addressed. Almost all urban data have an indexed structure and, in particular, either attribute tables for statistical survey data and data from simple sensors (e.g., climate and pollution sensors) or vectors, mostly obtained from satellite images after large-scale spatio-temporal analysis. The paper also provides a discussion of the potential opportunities, emerging issues, and challenges that urban data sources face and should overcome to better catalyze intelligent/smart planning. This should contribute to the general understanding of the data, their sources and the challenges to be faced and overcome by those seeking data and integrating them into smart applications and urban-planning processes.

AB  - Abstract Models are the key tools humans use to manage complexity in description, development, and analysis. This applies to all scientific and engineering disciplines and in particular to the development of software and data-intensive systems. However, different methods and terminologies have become established in the individual disciplines, even in the sub-fields of Informatics, which raises the need for a comprehensive and cross-sectional analysis of the past, present, and future of modeling research. This paper aims to shed some light on how different modeling disciplines emerged and what characterizes them with a discussion of the potential toward a common modeling future. It focuses on the areas of software, data, and process modeling and reports on an analysis of the research approaches, goals, and visions pursued in each, as well as the methods used. This analysis is based on the results of a survey conducted in the communities concerned, on a bibliometric study, and on interviews with a prominent representative of each of these communities. The paper discusses the different viewpoints of the communities, their commonalities and differences, and identifies possible starting points for further collaboration. It further discusses current challenges for the communities in general and modeling as a research topic in particular and highlights visions for the future.

AB  - A number of algorithms in the field of artificial intelligence offer poorly interpretable decisions. To disclose the reasoning behind such algorithms, their output can be explained by means of so-called evidence-based (or factual) explanations. Alternatively, contrastive and counterfactual explanations justify why the output of the algorithms is not any different and how it could be changed, respectively. It is of crucial importance to bridge the gap between theoretical approaches to contrastive and counterfactual explanation and the corresponding computational frameworks. In this work we conduct a systematic literature review which provides readers with a thorough and reproducible analysis of the interdisciplinary research field under study. We first examine theoretical foundations of contrastive and counterfactual accounts of explanation. Then, we report the state-of-the-art computational frameworks for contrastive and counterfactual explanation generation. In addition, we analyze how grounded such frameworks are on the insights from the inspected theoretical approaches. As a result, we highlight a variety of properties of the approaches under study and reveal a number of shortcomings thereof. Moreover, we define a taxonomy regarding both theoretical and practical approaches to contrastive and counterfactual explanation.

AB  - Malnutrition is a nutritional imbalance in a child’s body. Currently, there have been many reviews done on malnutrition in children. However, reviews on artificial intelligence linked with malnutrition are yet to be done. Thus, this study aims to identify the implementation of artificial intelligence in predicting malnutrition using bibliometric analysis. The bibliometric analysis consists of four stages: determining the purpose and scope, selecting the analytical technique, collecting data, and presenting the findings. Data used for this analysis is sourced from the Scopus database. The investigation was conducted using VOSviewer and “Publish or Perish” software. Based on five searched words: malnutrition, artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning, it was found that machine learning is the most widely used artificial intelligence approach for malnutrition research. Deep learning techniques are reported to grow as it is introduced as a new method in artificial intelligence. Malnutrition prediction tasks are the most studied problem. The use of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and transfer learning methods are used tremendously in malnutrition prediction research. This analysis’s results help improve the quality of the review by showing the mapping areas for malnutrition research.

AB  - Abstract Within seismology, geology, civil and structural engineering, deep learning (DL), especially via generative adversarial networks (GANs), represents an innovative, engaging, and advantageous way to generate reliable synthetic data that represent actual samples’ characteristics, providing a handy data augmentation tool. Indeed, in many practical applications, obtaining a significant number of high-quality information is demanding. Data augmentation is generally based on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning data-driven models. The DL GAN-based data augmentation approach for generating synthetic seismic signals revolutionized the current data augmentation paradigm. This study delivers a critical state-of-art review, explaining recent research into AI-based GAN synthetic generation of ground motion signals or seismic events, and also with a comprehensive insight into seismic-related geophysical studies. This study may be relevant, especially for the earth and planetary science, geology and seismology, oil and gas exploration, and on the other hand for assessing the seismic response of buildings and infrastructures, seismic detection tasks, and general structural and civil engineering applications. Furthermore, highlighting the strengths and limitations of the current studies on adversarial learning applied to seismology may help to guide research efforts in the next future toward the most promising directions.

AB  - Despite decades of research and development in named entity resolution, dealing with name ambiguity is still a challenging issue for many bibliometric-enhanced information retrieval (IR) tasks. As new bibliographic datasets are created as a result of the upward growth of publication records worldwide, more problems arise when considering the effects of errors resulting from missing data fields, duplicate entities, misspellings, extra characters, etc. As these concerns tend to be of large-scale, both the general consistency and the quality of electronic data are largely affected. This paper presents an approach to handle these name ambiguity problems through the use of crowdsourcing as a complementary means to traditional unsupervised approaches. To this end, we present “AuthCrowd”, a crowdsourcing system with the ability to decompose named entity disambiguation and entity matching tasks. Experimental results on a real-world dataset of publicly available papers published in peer-reviewed venues demonstrate the potential of our proposed approach for improving author name disambiguation. The findings further highlight the importance of adopting hybrid crowd-algorithm collaboration strategies, especially for handling complexity and quantifying bias when working with large amounts of data.

AB  - AI-based systems are software systems with functionalities enabled by at least one AI component (e.g., for image- and speech-recognition, and autonomous driving). AI-based systems are becoming pervasive in society due to advances in AI. However, there is limited synthesized knowledge on Software Engineering (SE) approaches for building, operating, and maintaining AI-based systems. To collect and analyze state-of-the-art knowledge about SE for AI-based systems, we conducted a systematic mapping study. We considered 248 studies published between January 2010 and March 2020. SE for AI-based systems is an emerging research area, where more than 2/3 of the studies have been published since 2018. The most studied properties of AI-based systems are dependability and safety. We identified multiple SE approaches for AI-based systems, which we classified according to the SWEBOK areas. Studies related to software testing and software quality are very prevalent, while areas like software maintenance seem neglected. Data-related issues are the most recurrent challenges. Our results are valuable for: researchers, to quickly understand the state of the art and learn which topics need more research; practitioners, to learn about the approaches and challenges that SE entails for AI-based systems; and, educators, to bridge the gap among SE and AI in their curricula.

AB  - The concept of using wastewater as a substitute for limited water resources and environmental protection has enabled this sector to make major technological advancements and, as a result, has given us an abundance of physical data, including chemical, biological, and microbiological information. It is easier to comprehend wastewater treatment systems after studying this data. In order to achieve this, a number of studies use machine learning (ML) algorithms as a proactive approach to solving issues and modeling the functionalities of these processing systems while utilizing the experimental data gathered. The goal of this article is to use textual analysis techniques to extract the most popular machine learning models from scientific documents in the “Web of Science” database and analyze their relevance and historical development. This will help provide a general overview and global scientific follow-up of publications dealing with the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to overcome the challenges faced in wastewater treatment technologies. The findings suggest that developed countries are the major publishers of articles on this research topic, and an analysis of the publication trend reveals an exponential rise in numbers, reflecting the scientific community’s interest in the subject. As well, the results indicate that supervised learning is popular among researchers, with the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Regression (LR), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Decision Tree (DT), and Gradient Boosting (GB) being the machine learning models most frequently employed in the wastewater treatment domain. Research on optimization methods reveals that the most well-known method for calibrating models is genetic algorithms (GA). Finally, machine learning benefits wastewater treatment by enhancing data analysis accuracy and efficiency. Yet challenges arise as model training demands ample, high-quality data. Moreover, the limited interpretability of machine learning models complicates comprehension of the underlying mechanisms and decisions in wastewater treatment.

AB  - A combination of systematic and bibliometric literature review is applied. For bibliometric analysis a citation network analysis, keyword cluster analysis, burst detection analysis and the total citation score are evaluated. So far, literature mainly deals with creation of digital building models. However, in the operational phase of a building, updating digital building models is essential in order to use the digital building models for applications like maintenance, facility management and conversion planning. In this paper approaches and methods to update digital building data are examined systematically to reflect the current state of scientific knowledge. This will identify and compare update approaches for digital building models. Nine interrelated research areas can be identified that deal with updating digital building information. Based on the body of knowledge on the topic "Updating of digital building models", research gaps and poorly represented research areas are identified. One gap in research is the use of photogrammetry to update individual buildings during their operational phase. In addition to strong research areas such as geoscience, which has produced update approaches over the years, areas like factory planning have been identified which hardly consider approaches to updating as-built data. Only the most important and largest research areas involved have been considered. A more detailed examination would be possible, but would go beyond the scope of this paper. This paper is the first to analyse updating approaches in a detailed, systematic, and bibliographic manner. The holistic view of the topic of updating approaches of digital building models helps to get an overview of existing approaches. Especially because in building operation up-to-date digital plan documents of the building are increasingly needed, this overview is necessary.

AB  - Abstract This paper analyzes the research performance evolution of a scientific institute, from its genesis through various stages of development. The main aim is to obtain, and visually represent, bibliometric evidence of the correlation of organizational changes on the development of its scientific performance; particularly, structural and leadership changes. The study involves six bibliometric indicators to multidimensionally assess the evolution of the institution’s performance profile. For a case study, we selected the Renewable Energy Institute at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, created 35 years ago as a small laboratory, then it evolved to a research center and finally to a formal institute, which over the last 8 years changed from the traditional departmental structure to a network-based structure. The evolution of the multidimensional performance profiles is analyzed, and graphically represented, using a novel artificial intelligence-based approach. We analyzed the performance profiles evolution yearly, using Principal Components Analysis, and a self-organizing neural network mapping technique. This approach, combining bibliometric and machine learning techniques, proved to be effective for the assessment of the institution’s evolution process. The results were represented with a series of graphs and maps that clearly reveal the magnitude and nature of the performance profile evolution, as well as its correlation with each of the structural and leadership transitions. These exploratory results have provided us data and insights into the probable effects of these transitions on academic performance, that have been useful to create a dynamical model.

AB  - Research for development organizations generate tremendous amount of accessible knowledge, but given their scale, time and resource constraints, the impact of outputs is not systematically analyzed. This is because traditional bibliometric analyses present limitations to synthesize accumulated knowledge and retrofitting indicators to historical outputs. To address these shortcomings, this study proposes an integrated, web-based approach to systematically analyze the production and diffusion of knowledge from large-scale research programs, using climate research of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) as a case study. Our analytical framework employs text mining, social network analysis and hyperlink analysis to an unstructured mass of publicly available digital artifacts such as institutional repositories, citation databases, and social media to uncover narratives, dynamics, and relationships. Findings show CIMMYT's climate research is strongly incorporated into a holistic systems approach and that the institution is actively engaged in knowledge exchanges with key actors from the scientific, development and public policy communities. The proposed analytical framework establishes an effective approach for research for development organizations to leverage existing online data sources to assess the extent of their knowledge production, dissemination, and reach.

AB  - Abstract Citation indexes are by now part of the research infrastructure in use by most scientists: a necessary tool in order to cope with the increasing amounts of scientific literature being published. Commercial citation indexes are designed for the sciences and have uneven coverage and unsatisfactory characteristics for humanities scholars, while no comprehensive citation index is published by a public organisation. We argue that an open citation index for the humanities is desirable, for four reasons: it would greatly improve and accelerate the retrieval of sources, it would offer a way to interlink collections across repositories (such as archives and libraries), it would foster the adoption of metadata standards and best practices by all stakeholders (including publishers) and it would contribute research data to fields such as bibliometrics and science studies. We also suggest that the citation index should be informed by a set of requirements relevant to the humanities. We discuss four such requirements: source coverage must be comprehensive, including books and citations to primary sources; there needs to be chronological depth, as scholarship in the humanities remains relevant over time; the index should be collection driven, leveraging the accumulated thematic collections of specialised research libraries; and it should be rich in context in order to allow for the qualification of each citation, for example, by providing citation excerpts. We detail the fit-for-purpose research infrastructure which can make the Humanities Citation Index a reality. Ultimately, we argue that a citation index for the humanities can be created by humanists, via a collaborative, distributed and open effort.

AB  - It is known that recent studies on artificial intelligence technologies have been handled by different branches of science. One of the mentioned branches of science is education. The rapid increase in the production of artificial intelligence studies in the field of education in recent years attracts the attention of researchers. In this context, the purpose of the present study was to analyze the bibliometric aspects of journal publications on artificial intelligence technology in educational research. The R-Studio tool was used to examine the data set, which was collected from the Web of Science database. The only index fields allowed for articles are SSCI, SCI-Expanded, and ESCI. According to the results of the study, the journal articles on artificial intelligence technologies have appeared to have significantly increased in recent years. The United States, China, and Spain are the most prolific nations in this regard. Despite being among the ten most productive nations, Türkiye and Russia are among those that do not collaborate internationally. It has been found that journal articles on artificial intelligence give a lot of attention to subjects like dropout, chatbot, language learning, student involvement and performance, e-learning, and collaborative learning. We hope that this research will give academics who desire to study artificial intelligence technologies a general overview.

AB  - Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) refers to the interaction of workers and robots in a shared workspace. Owing to the integration of the industrial automation strengths with the inimitable cognitive capabilities of humans, HRC is paramount to move towards advanced and sustainable production systems. Although the overall safety of collaborative robotics has increased over time, further research efforts are needed to allow humans to operate alongside robots, with awareness and trust. Numerous safety concerns are open, and either new or enhanced technical, procedural and organizational measures have to be investigated to design and implement inherently safe and ergonomic automation solutions, aligning the systems performance and the human safety. Therefore, a bibliometric analysis and a literature review are carried out in the present paper to provide a comprehensive overview of Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) issues in HRC. As a result, the most researched topics and application areas, and the possible future lines of research are identified. Reviewed articles stress the central role played by humans during collaboration, underlining the need to integrate the human factor in the hazard analysis and risk assessment. Human-centered design and cognitive engineering principles also require further investigations to increase the worker acceptance and trust during collaboration. Deepened studies are compulsory in the healthcare sector, to investigate the social and ethical implications of HRC. Whatever the application context is, the implementation of more and more advanced technologies is fundamental to overcome the current HRC safety concerns, designing low-risk HRC systems while ensuring the system productivity.

AB  - Representation and modeling using the building information modeling (BIM) methodology of civil works have become the subject of increasing attention in recent years, thanks to the potential offered by Open Infrastructure BIM (I-BIM). However, the complexity of infrastructure works, i.e., the variety of construction and technological systems, makes Open I-BIM very complex and challenging. The lack of systemic knowledge on the subject is another challenging factor. The aim of the following research work is to provide a synoptic overview of the existing scientific research, accompanied by the most recent studies in the field of computer modeling, its applications, and the main opportunities that Open I-BIM offers to the infrastructure sector. After a thorough review of 198 scientific articles published between 2013 and 2023, this study systematically presents a holistic review and critical reflection on the current status of the use of Open BIM in the infrastructure sector, with a focus on the development of the tools and methods used. The outcome of this work constitutes a systematic review of the literature with a bibliometric analysis on Open I-BIM, which is able to provide a knowledge base for identifying research trends, common problems, and the potential of developed methods.

AB  - Growing awareness about environmental responsibility among businesses and policymakers has increased interest in Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM). For the first time, using the SDG mapping algorithms, this article focused on 7009 publications from 2013 to 2022 mapped explicitly to 17 SDGs. This study uses bibliometric and science mapping techniques to create a detailed mapping between GSCM research and SDGs. This study created an SDG citation network to show how specific SDGs are related to GSCM practices. The most mapped SDGs in this study are SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG 17 (Partnership for the Goals). Our results showed that GSCM research mainly focuses on three thematic areas: industry 4.0 and sustainable supply chains, GSCM practice coordination, and sustainable environmental policy management. This also includes integrating the circular economy into GSCM, sustainable sourcing, supply chain resilience, digital transformation in GSCM for better environmental performance, and the social impact of GSCM. A shift towards integrating sustainability into supply chain processes has been found. Environmental management, performance monitoring, and new technologies like Industry 4.0 and AI have been used to support the SDGs. International interest and collaboration in GSCM research can be seen from the bibliographic coupling study covering countries like Europe, Western Countries, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe. This study shows how GSCM can directly address global challenges identified by the United Nations by mapping GSCM research to specific SDGs.

AB  - Human osteological documented collections (DCs), also referred to as “identified collections”, are a valuable resource in biological and forensic anthropology, as they offer the possibility for hypothesis-driven research on sex and age-at-death estimation methods, human variability, and other morphometric-based parameters of individual identification. Consequently, they feature in many publications addressing the forensic sciences. The paper aims to explore the scientific profiles of DCs via publication using bibliometric data. The Dimensions databases were used to select the DC-related keywords in the title and abstracts of the publications. The search result analysis and extraction were conducted using VOSviewer. A total of 376 articles were found, published between 1969 and 2021 (November). The number of publications has increased over the years, specifically after 2011. The results show that most of the publications are associated with countries such as the United States and Portugal (the latter highlights the University of Coimbra), that the research tends to focus on human biological profiling (e.g., age, sex assessments), and that the journals with the highest numbers of publications were related to forensic sciences. This analysis shows a positive correlation between DC publications and the growth of forensic anthropology in recent years, with a slight shift towards the leading institutions that publish DC-based research. Hence, we can anticipate a change in the institutional leading profiles in the years to come.

AB  - An alternative research assessment (RA) tool was constructed to assess the relatedness of published business school research to the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The RA tool was created using Leximancer™, an on-line cloud-based text analytic software tool, that identified core themes within the SDG framework. Eight (8) core themes were found to define the ‘spirit of the SDGs’: Sustainable Development, Governance, Vulnerable Populations, Water, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Food Security, Restoration, and Public Health. These themes were compared to the core themes found in the content of 4576 academic articles published in 2019 in journals that comprise the Financial Times (FT) 50 list. The articles’ relatedness to the SDG themes were assessed. Overall, 10.6% of the themes found in the FT50 journal articles had an explicit relationship to the SDG themes while 24.5% were implied. Themes generated from machine learning (ML), augmented by researcher judgement (to account for synonyms, similar concepts, and discipline specific examples), improved the robustness of the relationships found between the SDG framework and the published articles. Although there are compelling reasons for business schools to focus research on advancing the SDGs, this study and others highlight that there is much opportunity for improvement. Recommendations are made to better align academic research with the SDGs, influencing how business school faculty and their schools prioritize research and its role in the world.

AB  - A new coronavirus, eventually identified as COVID-19, triggered an outbreak in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019. It has since spread around the world. This has also resulted in an increase in the number of publications pertaining to COVID-19. However, not much research has examined COVID-19 in information systems using bibliometrics. The purpose of this work is to develop a model for visualising COVID-19 research in information systems using bibliometric data. We did a brief survey of the literature in this study, followed by an analysis of related work. We anticipate that our proposed model will aid future researchers who wish to undertake bibliometric visualisations utilising it.

AB  - Risks and uncertainties are inevitable in construction projects and can drastically change the expected outcome, negatively impacting the project’s success. However, risk management (RM) is still conducted in a manual, largely ineffective, and experience-based fashion, hindering automation and knowledge transfer in projects. The construction industry is benefitting from the recent Industry 4.0 revolution and the advancements in data science branches, such as artificial intelligence (AI), for the digitalization and optimization of processes. Data-driven methods, e.g., AI and machine learning algorithms, Bayesian inference, and fuzzy logic, are being widely explored as possible solutions to RM domain shortcomings. These methods use deterministic or probabilistic risk reasoning approaches, the first of which proposes a fixed predicted value, and the latter embraces the notion of uncertainty, causal dependencies, and inferences between variables affecting projects’ risk in the predicted value. This research used a systematic literature review method with the objective of investigating and comparatively analyzing the main deterministic and probabilistic methods applied to construction RM in respect of scope, primary applications, advantages, disadvantages, limitations, and proven accuracy. The findings established recommendations for optimum AI-based frameworks for different management levels—enterprise, project, and operational—for large or small data sets.

AB  - Abstract It is well known that energy systems are one of the causes of climate change, but it is less studied how climate change impacts energy systems. Due to rapid changes in climate, it is important to understand how to operate energy systems and what adaptation methods should be used for different energy systems. The main aim of this paper is to compare content and trends in scientific literature. The bibliometric method is used to analyse the scientific literature on a specific topic from the SCOPUS database. This article analyses the trend of publication, the main topics of the studies, and possible research gaps. Results show that in recent years, the number of publications on climate change impact on energy systems has rapidly increased. Also, in the last year, there has been a trend for studies that look into machine learning, weather modelling in the context of energy systems adaptation, and efficiency improvement.

AB  - "In this paper, the scientific articles from the Web of Science base were analyzed, which address the investment classification criteria by means of the bibliometric analysis. Querying the Web of Science database and applying filters revealed a sample of 273 articles. The distribution by years, by countries, by authors, by categories, by fields of research, by sustainable development goals of this sample was followed. Also, within the work, a qualitative analysis was carried out, following the words and phrases with the highest density in the studied articles. The investigation method was based on the PRISMA Statements methodology. To determine the correlations regarding the countries of origin of the authors, the Co-authorship filter was used with a minimum number of 10 documents/country and a minimum number of 11 citations/country, so out of 73 countries only 14 met the conditions for analysis. For the word density analysis, the co-occurrence filter was applied, with a minimum occurrence of 5, resulting in 37 words grouped into 5 clusters. To support the conclusions, the following classifications were analyzed: WOS Categories, Research Areas, Sustainable Development Goals, Citation Topics Micro. The results of the research constitute the starting point for future analyzes in the field of investments."

AB  - Forecasting research disciplines associated with research projects is a significant challenge in research information systems. It can reduce the administrative effort involved in entering research project-related metadata, eliminate human errors, and enhance the quality of research project metadata. It also enables the calculation of the degree of interdisciplinarity of these projects. However, predicting scientific research disciplines and measuring interdisciplinarity in a research endeavor remain difficult. In this paper, we propose a framework for predicting the research disciplines associated with a research project and measuring the degree of interdisciplinarity based on associated metadata to address these issues. The proposed framework consists of several components to improve the performance of research disciplines prediction and interdisciplinarity measurement systems. These include a feature extraction component that utilizes a topic model to extract the most appropriate features. Further, the framework proposes a discipline encoding component that applies a data mapping strategy to lower the dimensionality of the output variables. Furthermore, a distance matrix creation component is proposed to recommend the most appropriate research disciplines and compute interdisciplinarity associated with research projects. We implemented the suggested framework on two separate research information systems databases for research projects, Dimensions and the Flemish Research Information Space. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework predicts the research disciplines associated with research projects more accurately than related work.

AB  - Information dissemination occurs through the 'word of media' in the digital world. Fraudulent and deceitful content, such as misinformation, has detrimental effects on people. An implicit fact-based automated fact-checking technique comprising information retrieval, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques assist in assessing the credibility of content and detecting misinformation. Previous studies focused on linguistic and textual features and similarity measures-based approaches. However, these studies need to gain knowledge of facts, and similarity measures are less accurate when dealing with sparse or zero data. To fill these gaps, we propose a 'Content Similarity Measure (CSM)' algorithm that can perform automated fact-checking of URLs in the healthcare domain. Authors have introduced a novel set of content similarity, domain-specific, and sentiment polarity score features to achieve journalistic fact-checking. An extensive analysis of the proposed algorithm compared with standard similarity measures and machine learning classifiers showed that the 'content similarity score' feature outperformed other features with an accuracy of 88.26%. In the algorithmic approach, CSM showed improved accuracy of 91.06% compared to the Jaccard similarity measure with 74.26% accuracy. Another observation is that the algorithmic approach outperformed the feature-based method. To check the robustness of the algorithms, authors have tested the model on three state-of-the-art datasets, viz. CoAID, FakeHealth, and ReCOVery. With the algorithmic approach, CSM showed the highest accuracy of 87.30%, 89.30%, 85.26%, and 88.83% on CoAID, ReCOVery, FakeHealth (Story), and FakeHealth (Release) datasets, respectively. With a feature-based approach, the proposed CSM showed the highest accuracy of 85.93%, 87.97%, 83.92%, and 86.80%, respectively.

AB  - In the last decade, many artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been used to solve various problems in sustainable energy (SE). Consequently, an increasing volume of research has been devoted to this topic, making it difficult for researchers to keep abreast of its developments. This paper analyzes 18,715 articles—about AI techniques used for SE—indexed in Scopus and published from 2013 to 2022, which were retrieved and selected following a novel iterative methodology. Besides calculating basic bibliometric indicators, we used clustering techniques and a co-occurrence analysis of author keywords to discover and characterize dominant themes in the literature. As a result, we found eight dominant themes in SE (solar energy, smart grids and microgrids, fuel cells, hydrogen, electric vehicles, biofuels, wind energy, and energy planning) and nine dominant techniques in AI (genetic algorithms, support vector machines, particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, classical neural networks, fuzzy logic controllers, reinforcement learning, deep learning, and multi-objective optimization). Each dominant theme is discussed in detail, highlighting the most relevant work and contributions. Finally, we identified the AI techniques most widely used in each SE area to solve its specific problems.

AB  - Abstract Scientific research is driven by allocation of funding to different research projects based in part on the predicted scientific impact of the work. Data-driven algorithms can inform decision-making of scarce funding resources by identifying likely high-impact studies using bibliometrics. Compared to standardized citation-based metrics alone, we utilize a machine learning pipeline that analyzes high-dimensional relationships among a range of bibliometric features to improve the accuracy of predicting high-impact research. Random forest classification models were trained using 28 bibliometric features calculated from a dataset of 1,485,958 publications in medicine to retrospectively predict whether a publication would become high-impact. For each random forest model, the balanced accuracy score was above 0.95 and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was above 0.99. The high performance of high impact research prediction using our proposed models show that machine learning technologies are promising algorithms that can support funding decision-making for medical research.

AB  - Product-based companies worldwide attempt to integrate services into their offerings, embarking on “servitization” as a key strategy. These days, the acceleration of technological innovation (i.e., Industry 4.0) has triggered an emerging IT-driven business paradigm called digital servitization or smart product-service system (PSS) that embeds Industry 4.0 technologies. As a result of these developments, related literature has expanded across different disciplines in recent years. However, understanding and describing literature is not easy considering its volume and variety. Establishing common ground for central concepts is essential for science. Thus, to clarify important topics and research issues on servitization and PSSs in Industry 4.0, we carry out a comprehensive literature review by performing text mining of 419 journal articles. A machine learning approach is applied to learn and identify the specific topics, and the suggested key references are manually reviewed to develop a state-of-the-art overview. A total of 10 key research topics are identified, and the enabler–engineering–goal framework is developed. This study contributes to clarifying a systematized view of dispersed studies of servitization and PSSs in Industry 4.0 across multiple disciplines and encourages further academic discussions and industrial transformation.

AB  - Terahertz radiation for inspection and fault detection has been of interest for the semiconductor industry since the first generation and detection of THz signals. Until recent hardware advances, THz systems lacked the signal quality and reliability for use as an effective nondestructive testing (NDT) method. Incremental advances in THz sources, detectors, and signal processing resulted in the successful applied-industrial use of THz NDT techniques on carbon fiber laminates, automotive coatings, and for detection of counterfeit pharmaceutical tablets. Semiconductor inspection and verification methods ensure the functionality and thereby safety of vital electronics for several critical industries. For this reason, the reliability and verification of a THz NDT method must exceed currently used inspection systems. With recent laboratory access to THz radiation, THz inspection methods are often compared with existing optical, electrical, and volumetric semiconductor verification techniques for their production monitoring and failure analysis viability. This review will cover THz techniques and their applications at the printed circuit board (PCB), integrated circuit (IC), and transistor/gate scales. The THz radiation gap spans between optical and electronic ranges with a millimeter-sized wavelength allowing for adequate penetration of plastic and ceramic and semiconductor materials. THz radiation can be used to determine structural features, electrical signatures in the THz range, and chemical information simultaneously. Cost and environmental limitations restricted the ability for THz NDT semiconductor inspection methods to escape the lab and succeed in the dynamic environment of a semiconductor fabrication environment. Hybridized metrology methods incorporating information from multiple inspection tools are a regime where THz spectral and structural data can be combined with existing methods such as optical, x-ray, or E-beam. THz can be used initially to offer support to the complex failure analysis and verification requirements of the semiconductor industry from nanoscale to macroscale features and components. For THz systems to become independent inspection tools used for semiconductor production monitoring, in the lab or fab, this will require a confident level of statistical process control for THz signal generation, detection, or processing. Applied industrial semiconductor device inspection will likely be a result of a combination of research into THz hardware, reconstruction techniques, and the widespread application of machine learning techniques. Many breakthroughs occurred over the years to enable successful nondestructive characterization and inspection of semiconductor devices from the nanoscale transistors to fully packaged integrated circuits and assembled PCBs.

AB  - Objective: To explore the progress of scientific production on cyber risks that permeate the service sector, identifying relevant researchers and institutions on this theme, measuring the impact, and identifying trends, contributions, and knowledge gaps. In addition, the study seeks to use bibliometric findings to bring academic and managerial contributions to the subject. Methodology: Bibliometric study, using the method of organization and systematization of information (Chueke &amp; Amatucci, 2015; Guedes &amp; Borschiver, 2015), whose structure followed the premises of the laws of Bradford, Lotka, and Zipf, using the scientific databases of the WoS - Web of Science. The bibliometric study enabled the performance of exploratory and descriptive research without the temporal cut, resulting in the identification of 115 publications (December 1995 to February 2023), which allowed measuring and presenting the characteristics and profile of the publications analyzed. Originality: The study revealed a potential for exploring the theme of Cyber Risks in the Services sector, considering the scarcity of scientific production. It also enabled the identification of emerging trends and clusters in service sector activities and the creation of a conceptual model based on the findings of the analyzed publications. Main results: The analyses revealed which sectors of the service economy are most frequently approached in publications related to the theme of cyber risks. These analyses were organized into ten areas, with the following order of relevance (frequency) of publication: Computer Science, Information Systems, Engineering, Business, Finance and Management, Telecommunications, Computer Science Theory Methods, and Computer Science Artificial Intelligence. The bibliometric findings enabled the creation of the conceptual model of Cyber Risks in Services, which proposes a cyclical and continuous improvement approach to deal with vulnerabilities, cyber threats, and consequences. This includes identifying and assessing existing vulnerabilities, implementing mitigation measures, and constantly monitoring threats and their consequences. Theoretical contributions: The conceptual model of Cyber Risks in Services can be a reference for researchers in various fields of action, considering the breadth of the services sector and the interdisciplinary nature of digital risk mitigation. Managerial contributions: Understanding of cyber risks supports the ability of the organization to respond to them, strengthening its security posture and protecting its critical assets and information from cyber threats.

AB  - This article aims to show how the Big Data techniques application in accounting to monitor international cooperation projects are a green-field in the academic world. To obtain an exhaustive vision of the state of the art in academic research in this field, a bibliometric analysis has been carried out, based on multiple Web of Science searches, with focus on international development, Big Data and accounting, adding the holistic vision of the 17 SDGs or “Sustainable Development Goals” of the UN Agenda 2030. Research on Big Data, international development and accounting is a new field that has started in 2015 although academic literature is still scarce. Publications related to SDGs also begin on that date, but with much more prolific academic literature, without explicit references to the use of Big Data in accounting. The article finds deficiencies in existing academic research compared to other enterprise fields in which Big Data techniques are much more developed, and international organization reports lead this line of research, as opposed to the scholarly world. The main practical implication derived from the paper is the need to deepen in real cases of use outside the academic sphere as a starting point to develop this line of research. The development of this research area will help NPOs and governments to have a better accounting to evaluate the impact of their initiatives and cooperation projects. In addition to the bibliometric techniques used for the analysis of main publications, authors and relevant topics focused on this area of study, the authors consider a challenge and an opportunity to take the plunge into this field from academic world, which will undoubtedly improve decision-making in international development, emphasizing the need to gain momentum given the current state of greenfield.

AB  - Abstract Evaluation of researchers’ output is vital for hiring committees and funding bodies, and it is usually measured via their scientific productivity, citations, or a combined metric such as the h-index. Assessing young researchers is more critical because it takes a while to get citations and increment of h-index. Hence, predicting the h-index can help to discover the researchers’ scientific impact. In addition, identifying the influential factors to predict the scientific impact is helpful for researchers and their organizations seeking solutions to improve it. This study investigates the effect of the author, paper/venue-specific features on the future h-index. For this purpose, we used a machine learning approach to predict the h-index and feature analysis techniques to advance the understanding of feature impact. Utilizing the bibliometric data in Scopus, we defined and extracted two main groups of features. The first relates to prior scientific impact, and we name it ‘prior impact-based features’ and includes the number of publications, received citations, and h-index. The second group is ‘non-prior impact-based features’ and contains the features related to author, co-authorship, paper, and venue characteristics. We explored their importance in predicting researchers’ h-index in three career phases. Also, we examined the temporal dimension of predicting performance for different feature categories to find out which features are more reliable for long- and short-term prediction. We referred to the gender of the authors to examine the role of this author’s characteristics in the prediction task. Our findings showed that gender has a very slight effect in predicting the h-index. Although the results demonstrate better performance for the models containing prior impact-based features for all researchers’ groups in the near future, we found that non-prior impact-based features are more robust predictors for younger scholars in the long term. Also, prior impact-based features lose their power to predict more than other features in the long term.

AB  - Digital transformation significantly influences public administration by integrating advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and big data analytics across various governmental functions. In this study, the use of LDA alongside advanced bibliometric techniques such as citation analysis and co-citation networks to explore the evolution and current status of digital transformation in public administration provides a structured examination of large data sets obtained from the Web of Science, providing a thematic and intellectual insight into the field. Analyzing 628 articles, our research highlights how traditionally engineering-associated technologies are increasingly applied within the social sciences, transforming public management processes and policies. Our findings reveal that digital transformation in public administration is predominantly driven by external pressures rather than internal organizational initiatives. The importance of this study lies in its ability to map and visualize the transformative impact of digital technologies on governance structures, policy-making processes, and public engagement. Revealing that the databased, more transparent and participatory nature of public administration has increased, the study not only maps the thematic evolution of public administration but also discusses the consequences of these transformations for policy makers and public administrators. Integrating digital tools has enhanced service delivery and operational efficiency but also presents challenges, such as the need for comprehensive cybersecurity strategies and continuous adaptation to technological advancements.

AB  - In the architecture, engineering, and construction industries, the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) has become instrumental in shaping the design and commissioning of smart buildings. At the center of this development is the pursuit of more intelligent, efficient, and sustainable built environments. The emergence of smart buildings equipped with advanced sensor networks and automation systems increasingly requires the implementation of Digital Twins (DT) for the direct coupling of BIM methods for integral building planning, commissioning, and operational monitoring. While simulation tools and methods exist in the design phase of developing advanced controls, their mapping to construction or post-construction models is less well developed. Through systematic, keyword-based literature research on publisher-independent databases, this review paper gives a comprehensive overview of the state of the research on BIM integration of building control systems with a primary focus on combined controls for daylight and artificial lighting systems. The review, supported by a bibliometric literature analysis, highlights major development fields in HVAC controls, failure detection, and fire-detection systems, while the integration of daylight and artificial lighting controls in Digital Twins is still at an early stage of development. In addition to already existing reviews in the context of BIM and Digital planning methods, this review particularly intends to build the necessary knowledge base to further motivate research activities to integrate simulation-based control methods in the BIM planning process and to further close the gap between planning, implementation, and commissioning.

AB  - Data quality plays a crucial role in tasks, such as enhancing the accuracy of data analytics and avoiding the accumulation of redundant data. One of the significant challenges in data quality is dealing with missing data, which has been extensively explored by the scholarly community and has resulted in a significant increase in related publications. It is important to recognize that the landscape of missing data in computer science offers numerous opportunities for further research. However, upon closer examination of existing studies, it becomes evident that many have not fully utilized bibliometric analysis tools and software for comprehensive literature reviews. Therefore, this study aims to explore the essential characteristics, trends, and prevailing themes in the field of missing data imputation. Through a thorough bibliometric analysis, this study demonstrated the evolution of knowledge and key focal points in the field of missing data imputation. The analysis consisted of 352 journal papers in social sciences published between 2012 and 2023, all centered on missing data imputation. Among these publications, "IEEE Access" has become a highly respected source. To systematically explore various aspects of missing data imputation, a conceptual framework was used to uncover potential research directions and underlying themes. Ultimately, a thematic map serves as a valuable tool for providing a comprehensive understanding, categorizing significant concepts into basic or overarching, developing, or declining, central, highly developed, and isolated themes. These overarching and underlying themes offer valuable insights and pave the way for prospective directions and critical areas of study.

AB  - The term "prosumers" coined by Toffler, relates to those customers who also engage in the co-creation of products, which they only partly consume, and whose balance is made available to a broader group. But even though the role of prosumers is increasingly relevant as a more comprehensive number of people are engaging in the production of products to be shared by others, there is a need for studies that aim at identifying how widespread they are, and the concrete contribution they are providing to some key area such as, for energy, energy generation and distribution. Based on the need to address this research gap, this paper reports on a study on prosumer behaviour in a sustainable development (SD) context, with a focus on the energy sector. The paper deploys a mixed-methods approach which entails a bibliometric analysis of prosumers from a sustainability perspective - to gain a better understanding of the topic -, a quantitative study of prosumers' behaviour in the field of renewable energy involving respondents from 44 countries, and a set of case studies, supported by the literature, which illustrates current trends. The novelty of this paper resides in the fact that it explores the role of prosumers in an SD context across many countries in the critical area of energy generation and use, outlining the drivers of positive behaviour and identifying some further information needs.

AB  - Machine learning, with a dramatic breakthrough in recent years, is showing great potential to upgrade the power system optimization toolbox. Understanding the strength and limitation of machine learning approaches is crucial to answer when and how to integrate them in various power system optimization tasks. This paper pays special attention to the coordination between machine learning approaches and optimization models, and carefully evaluates to what extent such data-driven analysis may benefit the rule-based optimization. A series of typical references are selected and categorized into four kinds: the boundary parameter improvement, the optimization option selection, the surrogate model and the hybrid model. This taxonomy provides a novel perspective to understand the latest research progress and achievements. We further discuss several key challenges and provide an in-depth comparison on the features and designs of different categories. Deep integration of machine learning approaches and optimization models is expected to become the most promising technical trend.

AB  - As an autoimmune disease, Vogt‒Koyanagi‒Harada disease (VKHD) is a main type of uveitis in many countries and regions, significantly impacting patient vision. At present, information regarding VKHD is still limited, and further research is needed. We conducted a bibliometric analysis to characterize the overall status, current trends, and current focus of VKHD research.Literature published from 1975 to 2022 was obtained from the Web of Science core collection and analysed with the R-language packages Bibliometrix, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace software.A total of 1050 papers on VKHD were retrieved from 261 journals, and 16,084 references were obtained from the papers in the original search. The average annual number of published articles was approximately 21.9, and the number of publications rapidly increased after 2004. The journal Ocular Immunology and Inflammation published the most papers on VKHD, while the American Journal of Ophthalmology has the highest citation frequency. The leading countries were Japan, China (PRC), and the United States of America (USA). Yang PZ from Chongqing Medical University was the most prolific and cited author. The most frequently cited study discussed revision of VKHD diagnostic criteria. An analysis of the highest frequency keywords showed that most research focused on the treatment, diagnosis, and pathogenesis of VKHD and its relationship with other related diseases. At present, the most urgent research direction is in the relationship between COVID-19 or COVID-19 vaccines and VKHD and the corresponding mechanisms underlying it.Utilizing dynamic and visualization tools, bibliometrics provides a clear depiction of the research history, development trends, and research hotspots in VKHD It serves as a valuable tool for identifying research gaps and areas that necessitate further exploration. Our study revealed potential directions for future VKHD research, including investigating specific molecular mechanisms underlying the disease, exploring the clinical utility of optical coherence tomography angiography and other diagnostic techniques, and conducting clinical research on novel therapeutic drugs.

AB  - Abstract Bibliometric mapping offers easiness in analyzing the relationship between publications through the network visuals created. Several applications, such as VOSviewer, Bibliometrix, and CiteSpace, make conducting network analysis more convenient. Moreover, the relationship provided is usually in the form of an undirected graph, which negates the two-way relationship created. This study attempts to demonstrate the significance of considering two-way relationships by proposing a keyword network formed using bidirected graphs and association rules to examine the two-way relationship of two or more keywords. According to the proposed bidirected graph, a two-way graph can add value and insight by analyzing the correlation between a single keyword and several others. Two of the four metrics used, Confidence and Conviction, are sufficient to support directed graphs. In contrast, Support and Full Counting are related because they both see the occurrences of a keyword, so using undirected graphs is necessary.

AB  - Difficulties in collecting, processing, and identifying massive data have slowed research on cutting-edge science and technology hotspots. Promoting these technologies will not be successful without an effective data-driven method to identify cutting-edge technologies. This paper proposes a data-driven model for identifying global cutting-edge science technologies based on SpaCy. In this model, we collected data released by 17 well-known American technology media websites from July 2019 to July 2020 using web crawling with Python. We combine graph-based neural network learning with active learning as the research method in this paper. Next, we introduced a ten-fold cross-check to train the model through machine learning with repeated experiments. The experimental results show that this model performed very well in entity recognition tasks with an F value of 98.11%. The model provides an information source for cutting-edge technology identification. It can promote innovations in cutting-edge technologies through its effective identification and tracking and explore more efficient scientific and technological research work modes.

AB  - The paper offers an overview of publications on the use of bibliometric analysis in various scientific studies. It was found out that the use of the scientific mapping tool to carry out such analysis at the stage of identifying early career scientists’ research directions has not been previously explored. A sample statistical survey of 68 supervisors of Master’s research from the National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine and Ternopil Volodymyr Hnatiuk National Pedagogical University revealed that research supervisors with little experience, as well as supervisors in the field of social sciences and the humanities, lag behind in the use of channels and tools of modern digital scholarly communications. It is suggested that the use of built-in tools of bibliometric systems for systematic analysis aimed at determining the directions of Master’s research will contribute to the quality of Master’s theses, and hence to the development of university science in the context of its integration into the global research space. The authors propose a case of applying scientific mapping for the queries for search of scientific publications in Scopus and Web of Science (WOS) scientometric databases, based on the research areas of the Department of Informatics and Methods of Its Teaching of Ternopil Volodymyr Hnatiuk National Pedagogical University. The paper describes approaches to the use of VOSviewer to produce terminological maps based on concepts occurring in the titles, keywords and abstracts of the relevant sets of scientific publications. Since the Department offers Master’s programs for students majoring both in Education/Pedagogy (014 Secondary Education (Informatics)) and Information Technology (122 Computer Science), on the basis of the analysis of links in thesauri from the Web of Science and Scopus data sets the authors identified research directions and provided examples of research themes for Master’s theses majoring in Educational Technology and Information Technology, respectively. The results of the conducted survey and in-depth interviews with Master’s students’ research supervisors showed the expediency of expanding the pedagogical experiment aimed at the development of the methods of systematic literature review at various stages of working on a Master’s thesis, involving the use of a wide range of bibliographic analysis tools. The results presented in the paper can be useful both for early career researchers and their research supervisors.

AB  - Smart grids are one of the last decades' innovations in electrical energy. They bring relevant advantages compared to the traditional grid and significant interest from the research community. Assessing the field's evolution is essential to propose guidelines for facing new and future smart grid challenges. In addition, knowing the main technologies involved in the deployment of smart grids (SGs) is important to highlight possible shortcomings that can be mitigated by developing new tools. This paper contributes to the research trends mentioned above by focusing on two objectives. First, a bibliometric analysis is presented to give an overview of the current research level about smart grid deployment. Second, a survey of the main technological approaches used for smart grid implementation and their contributions are highlighted. To that effect, we searched the Web of Science (WoS), and the Scopus databases. We obtained 5,663 documents from WoS and 7,215 from Scopus on smart grid implementation or deployment. With the extraction limitation in the Scopus database, 5,872 of the 7,215 documents were extracted using a multi-step process. These two datasets have been analyzed using a bibliometric tool called bibliometrix. The main outputs are presented with some recommendations for future research.

AB  - Abstract In recent years, the tendency of the number of financial institutions to include cryptocurrencies in their portfolios has accelerated. Cryptocurrencies are the first pure digital assets to be included by asset managers. Although they have some commonalities with more traditional assets, they have their own separate nature and their behaviour as an asset is still in the process of being understood. It is therefore important to summarise existing research papers and results on cryptocurrency trading, including available trading platforms, trading signals, trading strategy research and risk management. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of cryptocurrency trading research, by covering 146 research papers on various aspects of cryptocurrency trading ( e . g ., cryptocurrency trading systems, bubble and extreme condition, prediction of volatility and return, crypto-assets portfolio construction and crypto-assets, technical trading and others). This paper also analyses datasets, research trends and distribution among research objects (contents/properties) and technologies, concluding with some promising opportunities that remain open in cryptocurrency trading.

AB  - The topic of artificial intelligence known as computational intelligence focuses on the research of adaptive processes that facilitate rational behaviour in complicated and ever-changing environments. These processes include the Artificial Intelligence archetypes that can generalise, abstract, discover, and associate as well as learn or adapt to novel contexts. In recent decades, a lot of academics have concentrated on Computational Intelligence, demonstrating that the field has expanded greatly. However, in the last two years, the trend has changed, as evidenced by the decline in number of publications published annually. Computational intelligence, one of artificial intelligence’s dimensions, has recently lost some of its prominence in the modern world as artificial intelligence gains substantial appeal. This is why, it is more important than ever to discover the most prominent and active scholars in the subject, as well as the top journals and academic institutions that are still working on this dimension. In order to undertake this study, bibliometric analysis was undertaken highlighting the main authors, institutions, nations, and journals actively publishing articles on computational intelligence. It was also observed that due to its classification as a subset of artificial intelligence and the increasing amount of study being done in that subject alone, computational intelligence has recently lost ground in terms of research interest and that explains the reason for the declining trend in the study of computational intelligence.

The methodology of the conducted research consisted of five procedural steps, including the planning of the research, conducting a systematic review of the literature, proposing a classification framework corresponding to contemporary research trends related to the risk of drone applications, and compiling the characteristics of the publications assigned to each of the highlighted thematic groups. This systematic literature review used the PRISMA method. A total of 257 documents comprising articles and conference proceedings were analysed. On this basis, eight thematic categories related to the use of drones and the risks associated with their operation were distinguished. Due to the high content within two of these categories, a further division into subcategories was proposed to illustrate the research topics better. The conducted investigation made it possible to identify the current research trends related to the risk of drone use and pointed out the existing research gaps, both in the area of risk assessment methodology and in its application areas. The results obtained from the analysis can provide interesting material for both industry and academia.

AB  - Abstract Leaks in resource transmission pipelines is a growing concern for the water transmission industry. This creates a need to prevent the threat of leaks and minimize their damages through extensive research in leak detection technology. This research work provides a thorough investigation into the history of leak detection in pipelines by surveying the web of knowledge database and visualizing the outputs using visualization software VOSviewer and CiteNetExplorer. The analysis of the web of knowledge output presents a set of the ten most used keywords in the field of leak detection in pipelines that are further described and analyzed. Additionally, in-depth analysis of a randomly selected sample of papers was conducted to draw a sense of the progress in the industry over the past four decades. This article also defines a novel approach to define the leak detection phases, i.e., the identify-localize-pinpoint approach. Furthermore, two classes of leak detection systems are identified, static leak detection systems and dynamic leak detection systems. The two systems are defined as well as their differentiative capabilities. Finally, this article provides a summary of popular leak detection technologies to provide a broad sense of understanding for the leak detection field of research.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to establish probable trends in the development of algorithmic means of network security and the protection of web resources in the future. The research methods used in this publication are a bibliometric analysis of 500 relevant publications, which allowed us to establish probable trends in the future development of the subject field. The study found that currently the most likely algorithmic means of network security and website protection that will be intensively developed in the future are blockchain technologies (to protect inter-resource contact), deep and machine learning (to analyze and detect attacks and digital anomalies), artificial intelligence and neural networks (to develop complex security algorithms), and predictive analysis (to prevent possible attacks and malicious data injections). At the same time, technological development makes it possible to identify alternative security tools, including quantum and post-quantum cryptography (which is possible due to the development of quantum computing), augmented reality (which is the next iteration of the development of the interface between machine-human interaction), biometric identification (which is the next iteration of authentication and recognition systems) and DevSecOps (which is a promising technology for the production of digital tools and systems that have a relatively lower level of vulnerability to known digital threats). The correlative impact of Industry 4.0 technologies and solutions on the studied aspects of the security sector of the World Wide Web has been established. The growth of the network of devices requires the improvement of security algorithms in the paradigm of Industry 4.0 technologies, which will allow more effective detection and prevention of cyberattacks and protection of user data.

AB  - Although many studies have focused on digital transformation and sustainability within the realm of project management, there has been a lack of research that comprehensively reviews the current state of the art of the aforementioned subject using a holistic approach. This oversight hampers the amalgamation of DT and sustainability in project management, waning the steps to be taken for the realisation of a smart and sustainable built environment. To fill the identified knowledge gap, this study presents a science mapping approach to meticulously examine the literature published on DT and sustainability within the realm of project management. In doing so, a bibliometric review together with a comprehensive Scientometric mapping analysis was carried out on the literature published from 2011 to 2022. The findings obtained in this study provide insightful accounts for both project managers and academics. Project managers are not only enlightened on revamping their business models but are also given insights into utilising digital strategies for bringing the maximum level of sustainability into their projects. Meanwhile, researchers are given insight into the emerging trends, timelines, and emerging streams that will be explored in future endeavours.

AB  - Abstract Migration studies have developed rapidly as a research field over the past decades. This article provides an empirical analysis not only on the development in volume and the internationalization of the field, but also on the development in terms of topical focus within migration studies over the past three decades. To capture volume, internationalisation, and topic focus, our analysis involves a computer-based topic modelling of the landscape of migration studies. Rather than a linear growth path towards an increasingly diversified and fragmented field, as suggested in the literature, this reveals a more complex path of coming of age of migration studies. Although there seems to be even an accelerated growth for migration studies in terms of volume, its internationalisation proceeds only slowly. Furthermore, our analysis shows that rather than a growth of diversification of topics within migration topic, we see a shift between various topics within the field. Finally, our study shows that there is no consistent trend to more fragmentation in the field; in contrast, it reveals a recent recovery of connectedness between the topics in the field, suggesting an institutionalisation or even theoretical and conceptual coming of age of migration studies.

AB  - Estimating crop evapotranspiration (ETc) is crucial for ensuring sustainable and efficient agricultural water management. Although this subject has garnered significant attention from the global scientific community, a comprehensive study encompassing the diversity, trends, and dynamics of research themes is currently lacking. To address this knowledge gap, this review employed a combined bibliometric and thematic approach to analyze bibliographic data from 1872 documents retrieved from the Web of Science™ core collection, spanning the period 1987–2022. The main findings of this review are as follows: (1) the scientific landscape is predominantly shaped by institutions from the USA and China; (2) the journal Agricultural Water Management emerged as the most prolific, with the highest number of publications and total citations; (3) a broad range of topics within ETc research were identified, with a notable emphasis on remote sensing-related subjects; (4) strategic coordination mapping revealed that ETc and reference evapotranspiration (ETo) remains an underdeveloped area of study; (5) climate change and machine learning emerged as key topics of significant scientific concern. The results suggest a need for enhanced institutional collaborations and expanded research investigations, particularly in regions grappling with agricultural water scarcity. Furthermore, research investigations should focus on ETc and ETo to fill existing knowledge gaps and advance both theoretical understanding and practical applications. Future studies should aim to contribute to the understanding of the impacts of climate change on ETc by leveraging machine learning techniques and enhancing our understanding of crop water requirements and their application in irrigation management, while also ensuring continuous updates to the existing body of knowledge to meet future challenges.

AB  - Infrastructure advancement is a key attribute that defines the development and effective growth of a city or region. Since the introduction of the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals (UN SDGs), more construction companies are focusing on adopting sustainable construction practices. However, a lack of relevant competencies among employees at various infrastructure construction organizations often hinders the successful implementation of sustainable practices. Education that facilitates systematic professional development and contemporary competencies’ acquisition is a key to overcoming this barrier. Thus, the current study adopts a three-stage review to identify current research trends and inform future research directions for the enhancement of the environmental sustainability competencies base for infrastructure professionals. A bibliometric assessment was first conducted followed by a focused literature review on sustainability education. Subsequently, two engineering and construction higher education curricula were assessed for infrastructure sustainability content. The results from the three-step analysis indicate that the growing interest in sustainability concepts in the construction industry is driven by policy changes. A lack of financial incentives, the unavailability of resources, a lack of motivation amongst graduates, and limited time in the infrastructure construction sector were identified as some of the major impediments for developing the environmental sustainability competencies base. The requirement for integrated and structured Continuous Professional Development (CPD) programs to facilitate ongoing knowledge acquisition and structured evaluation of professional knowledge in addition to effective undergraduate program development are highlighted. The necessity for a digitally personalised platform that can graphically represent current progress and future milestones and enable peer interaction and collaboration was also identified as critical for improving the uptake of such programs. The findings from this study could be useful for government agencies and infrastructure construction organizations keen to enhance the environmental sustainability knowledge of their employees. Future studies are required to assess sustainability education across the globe and to develop new learning components of infrastructure sustainability that are validated through stakeholder participation.

AB  - Learning to program requires diligent practice and creates room for discovery, trial and error, debugging, and concept mapping. Learners must walk this long road themselves, supported by appropriate and timely feedback. Providing such feedback in programming exercises is not a humanly feasible task. Therefore, the early and steadily growing interest of computer science educators in the automated assessment of programming exercises is not surprising. The automated assessment of programming assignments has been an active area of research for over a century, and interest in it continues to grow as it adapts to new developments in computer science and the resulting changes in educational requirements. It is therefore of paramount importance to understand the work that has been performed, who has performed it, its evolution over time, the relationships between publications, its hot topics, and open problems, among others. This paper presents a bibliometric study of the field, with a particular focus on the issue of automatic feedback generation, using literature data from the Web of Science Core Collection. It includes a descriptive analysis using various bibliometric measures and data visualizations on authors, affiliations, citations, and topics. In addition, we performed a complementary analysis focusing only on the subset of publications on the specific topic of automatic feedback generation. The results are highlighted and discussed.

AB  - As a sustainable and holistic approach to agriculture, agroecology has received considerable attention in recent years because of its potential to address the environmental, economic, and social challenges of agricultural systems. In order to identify key trends, influential authors, impactful journals, and emerging research themes surrounding the agroecological adoption topic, we performed a bibliometric analysis based on metadata from documents dealing with the topic and methods employed for its assessment over the period of January 1990 to July 2023, extracted from the Web of Science database. Based on the metadata of more than 1280 articles, our analyses show that the “identification of agroecology adoption determinants” and the “development of knowledge for food sovereignty” are among the trendiest research topics, while farming systems management and biodiversity issues are basic themes. The issue of analyzing agricultural productivity is more often linked to the impact of climate change. Also, we find that machine learning methods are not yet widely used to model the process of farm agroecological adoption. The contribution of African countries to the topic remains marginal in terms of documents produced, despite the predominance of traditional agriculture on the continent.

AB  - Abstract. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology is playing a major role in different applications. Indeed, the possibility of exploiting either 3D geometric features and radiometric information makes LiDAR suitable for a wide range of practical domains. LiDAR proved also being quite flexible in terms of platforms where it can be implemented for the acquisition, spanning from airborne sensors up to car-based and hand-held instruments. Due to the rapid expansion of research concerning LiDAR intensity, the ISPRS WG III/5 launched in 2017 an initiative aimed at providing free access to LiDAR data acquired by modern multispectral ALS sensors as well as MLS data. The two datasets, MLS Data Set 1 – (“Sun Prairie”), and Multispectral LiDAR Data Set 2 – (“Tobermory”), were provided by Teledyne Optech Company (Canada) and were made freely available to researchers upon request. This paper is presenting the first results of this initiative in terms of applications, application domains and topics tackled by applicants. The relevance of this data set is also evaluated through a bibliometric analysis considering both Scopus and Web of Science indexed databases to analyse the main directions where the scientific research, the technical development and the application interest is moving to.

AB  - Network-based procedures for topic detection in huge text collections offer an intuitive alternative to probabilistic topic models. We present in detail a method that is especially designed with the requirements of domain experts in mind. Like similar methods, it employs community detection in term co-occurrence graphs, but it is enhanced by including a resolution parameter that can be used for changing the targeted topic granularity. We also establish a term ranking and use semantic word-embedding for presenting term communities in a way that facilitates their interpretation. We demonstrate the application of our method with a widely used corpus of general news articles and show the results of detailed social-sciences expert evaluations of detected topics at various resolutions. A comparison with topics detected by Latent Dirichlet Allocation is also included. Finally, we discuss factors that influence topic interpretation.

AB  - Online product reviews have become a valuable resource for consumers seeking detailed information and making informed choices. The process of automatically extracting sentiment or opinions from these reviews heavily relies on sentiment analysis, a branch of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This research article focuses on sentiment categorization in online product evaluations, utilizing innovative techniques for mining consumer opinions. The project aims to establish a robust framework for sentiment analysis that accurately classifies emotions expressed in these reviews. The proposed system incorporates advanced deep learning and machine learning methods to enhance data classification and extract fine-grained sentiment information. The study addresses the unique challenges of sentiment analysis in the context of online product evaluations, including polarity changes, sarcasm, and domain-specific sentiment expressions, which often pose significant obstacles to precise sentiment classification. The approach combines feature engineering and deep learning techniques, extracting lexical, syntactic, and semantic features such as part-of-speech tags, n-grams, sentiment lexicons, and word embeddings from the review texts. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are employed as sophisticated neural network architectures to leverage these features, creating robust representations and capturing contextual information. The suggested architecture is extensively evaluated on a large dataset of online product reviews, demonstrating superior performance in sentiment categorization compared to existing approaches. The evaluation encompasses various sentiment classes, measuring metrics like accuracy, recall, and F1-score, and assessing the framework's adaptability to different product domains. The study showcases the effectiveness of advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms in sentiment categorization, advancing the field of sentiment analysis for online product evaluations. Businesses can gain valuable insights into customer sentiment and make well-informed decisions regarding product enhancements and marketing strategies by leveraging the proposed framework

AB  - In stock markets, technical analysis plays a vital role by offering valuable insights into price trends, patterns, and anticipated market movements, aiding investors in making well-informed decisions. This study employs bibliometric and topic modelling approaches on 589 English-language journal articles indexed in Scopus in the last two decades (from 2003 to 2023), exclusively focusing on technical analysis in stock markets. The keyword co-occurrence analysis identifies five topic clusters. The application of structural topic modelling also unravels five prominent thematic clusters, namely pattern-based forecasting, rule-based trading, algorithmic trading, techno-fundamental trading, and machine learning &amp;amp;amp; sentiment analysis. The topic of pattern-based forecasting involves researching the application of various patterns or models to predict stock prices. Rule-based trading concentrates on utilizing technical analysis tools to generate buy and sell signals, aiming for profitability. The algorithmic trading cluster explores the use of algorithms to systematically execute buy and sell actions, especially in high-frequency trading scenarios. Techno-fundamental trading investigates the integration of both fundamental and technical analysis in trading and investment decisions. Lastly, machine learning &amp;amp;amp; sentiment analysis focus on applying advanced machine learning techniques and sentiment analysis for predicting stock prices, highlighting the use of sophisticated methods in this domain. The three predominant topics in the dataset are &amp;quot;rule-based trading,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;machine learning &amp;amp;amp; sentiment analysis,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;algorithmic trading&amp;quot; constituting 26.79%, 23.52%, and 21.11% of the dataset, respectively. These findings underscore the prominence and significance of these themes within the context of the research domain.

AB  - Malware steals, encrypts, and damages data of the targeted machines for private, money, or fame purposes. The types of malware are root exploit, cryptojacking, Trojan, worms, viruses, spyware, ransomware, and adware. Among these types, root exploit is one of the most destructive malware types since it disguises and obscures all types of malware and provides a mechanism for other malware to carry out malicious acts invisibly. In the interest to review the progress of root exploit efforts globally, there is a need to inspect all publications that involve root exploit. Among all malware reviews previously, to date, there is still no trace of any bibliometric analysis that demonstrates the research impacts of root exploit and trends in bibliometric analysis. Hence, this paper adopts bibliometric analysis specifically on root exploit studies which evaluate: (1) Wordcloud; (2) WordTreeMap; (3) Three fields plot; (4) Thematic evolution; (5) Thematic maps; (6) Correspondence analysis (CA); (7) Dendrogram; and (8) Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA). To conclude, our bibliometric discovers that; 1) Linux and Android become main interest in root exploit studies. 2) Types of root exploit in virtualization layer and studies to detect on this area are increasing. 3) USA and China have become the leaders in root exploit research. 4) Research studies are more towards memory forensics to detect root exploit, which is more promising. 5) Instead of researching new methods of root exploit in compromising victims, root exploit researchers were more focused on detecting root exploits.

AB  - The paper aims to briefly compare and analyze the results of queries to IEEE Xplore and the leading abstract databases Scopus and Web of Science to identify research trends. Some errors were revealed in the Author Keywords in Web of Science. Therefore, a more detailed analysis that involved comparing various types of key terms was made only for IEEE Xplore and Scopus platforms. The study employed IEEE Access journal metadata as indexed on both platforms. Sample matching for IEEE Xplore and Scopus was achieved by comparing DOI. The IEEE Xplore metadata contains more key term types, which provides an advantage in analyzing research trends. Using NSPEC Controlled Terms from expert-compiled vocabulary provides more stable data, which gives an advantage when considering the change of terms over time. Apriori, an algorithm for finding association rules, was used to compare the co-occurrence of the terms for a more detailed description of sample subjects on both platforms. VOSviewer was used to analyze trends in scientific research based on IEEE Xplore data. The 2011-2021 ten-year period was divided into two sub-intervals for comparing the occurrence of Author Keywords, IEEE Terms, and NSPEC Controlled Terms. Bibliometric data of the IEEE conference proceedings was used to illustrate the importance of context in estimating the growth rate of publishing activity on a topic of interest.

AB  - The integrated application of building information modeling (BIM) and big data (BD) has received widespread attention, and has been involved in smart construction sites, construction project management, and construction project budgeting. Nevertheless, research on the integrated implementation of BIM and BD in China mainly concentrates on a project stage or profession, the exploration of technology integration mostly focuses on the theoretical level, and the research distribution is scattered. As such, the intention of this paper is to reveal the research history of BIM and BD in China, as well as to study the research methodologies and research fields for a more thorough knowledge of the BIM and BD research and development status in the Chinese construction sector, which adopts a mixed research method that uses a quantitative research via two analytical software tools, i.e., CiteSpace version of 6.1.R6 and the Statistical Analysis Toolkit on line edition for Informetrics software packages, to conduct a macro bibliometric analysis on BIM and BD research in the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, and provides a follow-up micro qualitative research with content analysis. To ensure the comprehensiveness of the research, the core articles of the topic in the web of science database have been sorted out and analyzed for fully understanding the development of BIM and BD in the field of Chinese construction, resulting in identifying the current research hotspots and trends in China. The results suggest that the popular research keywords on BIM and BD in China since the year 2015 have mainly been focused on informatization, the internet of things, and rail transportation. Three fruitful research themes in BIM and BD research in China have been identified, including smart construction, smart operation, and bridge informatization.

AB  - The use of a modern technological system requires a good engineering approach, optimized operations, and proper maintenance in order to keep the system in an optimal state. Predictive maintenance focuses on the organization of maintenance actions according to the actual health state of the system, aiming at giving a precise indication of when a maintenance intervention will be necessary. Predictive maintenance is normally implemented by means of specialized computational systems that incorporate one of several models to fulfil diagnostics and prognostics tasks. As complexity of technological systems increases over time, single-model approaches hardly fulfil all functions and objectives for predictive maintenance systems. It is increasingly common to find research studies that combine different models in multi-model approaches to overcome complexity of predictive maintenance tasks, considering the advantages and disadvantages of each single model and trying to combine the best of them. These multi-model approaches have not been extensively addressed by previous review studies on predictive maintenance. Besides, many of the possible combinations for multi-model approaches remain unexplored in predictive maintenance applications; this offers a vast field of opportunities when architecting new predictive maintenance systems. This systematic survey aims at presenting the current trends in diagnostics and prognostics giving special attention to multi-model approaches and summarizing the current challenges and research opportunities.

AB  - The field of software testing is growing and rapidly-evolving. Based on keywords assigned to publications, we seek to identify predominant research topics and understand how they are connected and have evolved. We apply co-word analysis to map the topology of testing research as a network where author-assigned keywords are connected by edges indicating co-occurrence in publications. Keywords are clustered based on edge density and frequency of connection. We examine the most popular keywords, summarize clusters into high-level research topics examine how topics connect, and examine how the field is changing. Testing research can be divided into 16 high-level topics and 18 subtopics. Creation guidance, automated test generation, evolution and maintenance, and test oracles have particularly strong connections to other topics, highlighting their multidisciplinary nature. Emerging keywords relate to web and mobile apps, machine learning, energy consumption, automated program repair and test generation, while emerging connections have formed between web apps, test oracles, and machine learning with many topics. Random and requirements-based testing show potential decline. Our observations, advice, and map data offer a deeper understanding of the field and inspiration regarding challenges and connections to explore.

AB  - The multidimensional character of sustainable agriculture mandates a systematic examination of this concept, necessitating methodological rigor for comprehensive analysis. In line with this imperative, the formulation of the composite index for sustainable agriculture was achieved through a compound, multi–stage procedural framework. This process involved the systematic grouping of 44 indicators into a specialized set, thereby delineating distinct facets within the dimensions of environmental (comprising 20 indicators), economic (comprising 16 indicators), and social (comprising 8 indicators) domains. This study aims to establish the correlation between the advancement of sustainable agriculture and quality of life, which encapsulates the circumstances of an individual’s existence. The significance of probing this correlation lies in the fact that sustainable agriculture, rooted in the efficient utilization of natural, social, and economic resources, inherently influences the quality of life—a paramount objective in the realm of social development. The quality of life in this study is represented by the Quality–of–Life Index (QoL) computed by CEO World. To achieve the aforementioned objective, a combination of complex methodologies was employed, encompassing quantitative analyses (statistical, bibliometric) and qualitative analyses (analysis and synthesis). The outcomes reveal that a systemic approach is most suitable for researching sustainable agriculture. The assessment of sustainable agriculture through the composite index underscores the relevance of all three dimensions in its formulation. Results from the correlation analysis suggest a robust connection between sustainable agriculture and quality of life. Simultaneously, a prominent level of interdependence between GDPs per capita and sustainable agriculture is observed.

On 2020-07-29, the altmetric data of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were obtained from the Altmetric database (Altmetric LLP, London, UK). Bibliometric data of the top 5% AAS of CSRs were extracted from the Web of Science. Keyword co-occurrence, co-authorship and co-citation network analyses were then employed using VOSviewer software. The random forest model was used to rank the importance of the altmetric resource. A total of 11222 CSRs with AAS were found (Total mentions: 305265), with Twitter being the most popular Altmetric resource. Consequently, the top 5% AAS (649 articles, mean AAS: 204.95, 95% confidence level: 18.95, mean citations: 123.68, 95% confidence level: 13.9) were included. Density mapping revealed female, adult and child as the most popular author keywords. According to network visualization, Helen V. Worthington (University of Manchester, Manchester, UK), the University of Oxford and UK had the greatest impact on the network at the author, organization and country levels respectively. AAS were weekly correlated with citations (rs=0.21) although citations were moderately correlated with policy document and blog mentions (rs=0.46 and rs=0.43). Cochrane systematic reviews received high levels of online attention, particularly in the Twittersphere and mostly from the UK. However, CSRs were rarely publicized and discussed using recently developed academic tools, such as F1000 prime, Publons and PubPeer.

AB  - Abstract In this article, we study the international mobility of researchers in the field of computer science (CS). Our analysis hinges upon Scopus data spanning a time period of 30 years (1991–2020) and involves a total of 969,835 researchers and 8,412,543 publications. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we characterize mobility as a fairly common phenomenon in CS, we highlight a strong correlation with standard bibliometric indicators at all seniority levels and a lower propensity of female researchers to relocate internationally than their male colleagues. Second, we analyze individual career paths building from them a mobility graph and identifying common patterns, such as the most traveled connections between different countries, whether they are equally traversed in both directions and the most frequently visited countries. The temporal evolution of the above patterns within our 30-year time frame is also investigated. The United States emerged as a preferred destination for internationally mobile authors, with strong connections to China (from the early 2000s), Canada, and several prominent European countries, most notably the United Kingdom, Germany, and France.

AB  - Deep learning models have achieved high performance across different domains, such as medical decision-making, autonomous vehicles, decision support systems, among many others. However, despite this success, the inner mechanisms of these models are opaque because their internal representations are too complex for a human to understand. This opacity makes it hard to understand the how or the why of the predictions of deep learning models. There has been a growing interest in model-agnostic methods that make deep learning models more transparent and explainable to humans. Some researchers recently argued that for a machine to achieve human-level explainability, this machine needs to provide human causally understandable explanations, also known as causability. A specific class of algorithms that have the potential to provide causability are counterfactuals. This paper presents an in-depth systematic review of the diverse existing literature on counterfactuals and causability for explainable artificial intelligence (AI). We performed a Latent Dirichlet topic modelling analysis (LDA) under a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework to find the most relevant literature articles. This analysis yielded a novel taxonomy that considers the grounding theories of the surveyed algorithms, together with their underlying properties and applications to real-world data. Our research suggests that current model-agnostic counterfactual algorithms for explainable AI are not grounded on a causal theoretical formalism and, consequently, cannot promote causability to a human decision-maker. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the explanations derived from popular algorithms in the literature provide spurious correlations rather than cause/effects relationships, leading to sub-optimal, erroneous, or even biased explanations. Thus, this paper also advances the literature with new directions and challenges on promoting causability in model-agnostic approaches for explainable AI.

AB  - Abstract The present study identifies, organizes, and structures the available scientific knowledge on the recent use and the prospects of Voice Assistants (VA) in private households. The systematic review of the 207 articles from the Computer, Social, and Business and Management research domains combines bibliometric with qualitative content analysis. The study contributes to earlier research by consolidating the as yet dispersed insights from scholarly research, and by conceptualizing linkages between research domains around common themes. We find that, despite advances in the technological development of VA, research largely lacks cross-fertilization between findings from the Social and Business and Management Sciences. This is needed for developing and monetizing meaningful VA use cases and solutions that match the needs of private households. Few articles show that future research is well-advised to make interdisciplinary efforts to create a common understanding from complementary findings—e.g., what necessary social, legal, functional, and technological extensions could integrate social, behavioral, and business aspects with technological development. We identify future VA-based business opportunities and propose integrated future research avenues for aligning the different disciplines’ scholarly efforts.

AB  - This study uses bibliometric review to assess research trends, most active contributors (subject area, source titles, countries, institutions, and authors), keywords analysis, and citation analysis of publications on stock market performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. The analyses examining the 720 Scopus publications from 2020-2022 were performed using Microsoft Excel, VOSviewer, WordSift, and Harzing’s Perish or Publish. The data indicated that research trends on stock market performance rose rapidly from 2020 to 2022. China has the most articles on stock market performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to developed countries, the findings indicated that emerging countries are performing better in publications. From the expanding number of author keywords in the literature, investor sentiment, spillover effect, and uncertainty are prospective literature gaps to focus on. Future researchers and business practitioners can use the study's findings to study how unusual events affect stock market performance.

AB  - The article presents a bibliometric analysis of 2019–2021 conference proceedings indexed in Scopus and dealing with the subject of Artificial Intelligence and Energy. The relevance of the subject is considered in the context of the energy transition and the application of artificial intelligence to the rational use of energy resources. A comparative analysis of the publication activity of researchers from Russia, China, India, the United States, and Indonesia on the subject in question is given. Methodology-wise, the emphasis for the purpose of identifying the subject is not on the co-occurrence of keywords but rather on the clustering of documents, which rests on the hypothesis that the titles of research contributions most concisely and fully reveal the content of the research paper and allow the subject matter expert to make a relevant choice of such contributions to facilitate their research. The study made use of two software tools: Carrot2 and Clustering App (CSV Explorer). It is shown that Russian contributions are characterized by the tendency of having engineering issues prevail while insufficient attention is paid to environmental, economic, and social issues of using AI in the energy sector. Studies originating from China and the United States are of the greatest interest in terms of the information presented, both with respect to the relevance of their topics and the cutting-edge nature of their content. Studies from India and Indonesia are more general in nature; of interest are the efforts of these countries to engage in global scientific activities.

AB  - Translation assessment, referring to evaluating various aspects related to translation, is crucial to the improvement of translation competence and quality. This study, taking valid papers on translation assessment published in WoS core collection from 2000 to 2022 as research samples, visualizes and reviews the research theme, research evolutions and emerging hot topics of translation assessment through bibliometric analysis. The number of annual publications shows that despite the general growth, the number of articles on translation assessment fluctuates from year to year. By Cite Space-based analysis of keywords co-occurrence, keyword clustering, time zone and burst detection, it finds that translation assessment mainly covers five themes, namely translation competence, translation quality, machine translation, translation teaching and training, and others. The overall evolution has been a gradual shift from concepts, metrics and evaluations of topics related to translation assessment into a topic of in-depth and interdisciplinary study. The hotspots in recent years include translation competence acquisition, neural machine translation and translation quality estimation. The findings reveal research evolutions and hot spots, propose implications for further translation assessment research and provide references for scholars who are interested in this topic.

AB  - Many industrialised countries have benefited from the advent of twenty-first century technologies, especially automation, that have fundamentally changed manufacturing and industrial production processes. The next step in the evolution of automation is the development of artificial intelligence (AI), i.e. intelligence which is demonstrated by machines and systems, which cannot only perform tasks but also work synergistically with humans and nature. Intelligent systems that can see, analyse situations and respond sensitively to real-time cues, from human gestures and facial expressions to pedestrians crossing a busy street, will reshape transportation, precision agriculture, biodiversity conservation, environmental modelling, public health, construction and manufacturing, as well as initiatives designed to promote prosperity on Earth. This paper explores the connections between AI systems and sustainable development (SD) research. By means of a literature review, world survey, and case studies, ways in which AI can support research on SD and, inter alia, contribute to a more sustainable and equitable world, are identified.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of pain comorbid and anxiety/depression in clinical observations has been high, and the number of related publications has increased in recent years. Nevertheless, few studies have used bibliometric methods to analyze the scientific research on comorbid pain and depression/anxiety. The aim of this study was to systematically examine the trends in global scientific research on comorbid pain and depression/anxiety from 2012 to 2022. Methods: Papers published between 2012 and 2022 were identified in the Web of Science database. Publications that examined comorbid pain and depression/anxiety were included. The language was limited to English. CiteSpace, Excel and VOSviewer were used to analyze the volume of publications, countries, institutions, authors, cocited authors, and keywords. Results: A total of 30,290 papers met the inclusion criteria of the study. Using CiteSpace, VOSviewer and Excel, the results showed that the United States (10,614 publications), Harvard University (1195 publications), and Jensen, Mark P. (77 publications) were the most productive country, institution, and author, respectively. The hotspots and frontiers were “relationship between depression and pain”, “gender differences in pain and depression/anxiety domains”, “study of specific pain types with depression/anxiety”, “treatment of pain combined with anxiety/depression”, and “effects of COVID-19 on patients with pain combined with depression/anxiety”. Conclusion: These findings indicate a growing interest in the field of comorbid pain and depression/anxiety. The research has been broad and deep, but there is still much room for growth. Furthermore, there is a need for more mature global collaborative networks as well as more high-quality research results in the future.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate how data analysis methods in dental studies have changed in recent years. Methods: A total of 400 articles published in 2010 and 2017 in five dental journals, Journal of Dental Research, Caries Research, Community Dentistry and Oral Epidemiology, Journal of Dentistry, and Acta Odontologica Scandinavica, were analyzed. The study characteristics and the reporting of data analysis techniques were systematically identified. Results: The statistical intensity of the dental journals did not change from 2010 to 2017. Dental researchers did not adopt the data mining, machine learning, or Bayesian approaches advocated in the computer-oriented methodological literature. The determination of statistical significance was the most generally used method for conducting research in both 2010 and 2017. Observational study designs were more common in 2017. Insufficient and incomplete descriptions of statistical methods were still a serious problem. Conclusion: The stabilization of statistical intensity in the literature suggests that papers applying highly computationally complex data analysis methods have not meaningfully contributed to dental research or clinical care. Greater rigor is required in reporting the methods in dental research articles, given the current pervasiveness of failure to describe the basic techniques used.

AB  - Urban green roofs have emerged as an innovative nature-based solution for enhancing urban sustainability and resilience. Based on the Web of Science Core Collection database, the scholarly papers on green roofs published in the past two decades were analyzed quantitatively and visualized using bibliometric techniques. The study scope covered research countries, institutions, main journals, crucial authors, highly cited documents, hot topics, and research frontiers. The 3210 publications mined from the bibliographic database on green roofs have increased progressively in the study period, with a significantly faster pace in recent years. The research subjects changed gradually over time, extending into more disciplines and becoming decidedly multidisciplinary. The notable bibliometric features registered a pronounced spatial concentration of research outputs in a small number of countries, regions, research institutions, journals, and researchers, mainly associated with developed metropolises. The number of publications and citation impacts identified the world’s top ten researchers and journals. Well-defined clusters depicted by knowledge graphs indicated a diverse range in the number and strength of inter-node connections for countries, institutions, researchers, and research topics defined by keywords. The research scope focuses on quantifying benefits and costs and optimizing designs to maximize biodiversity, hydrologic, thermal, and energy benefits as urban sustainability and climate-adaptation solutions. Emerging research should enhance biodiversity through optimal plant selection, integrate green roofs with renewable energy systems for sustainability, apply computational tools to enhance designs, evaluate low-cost and locally relevant design options for developing cities, and quantify co-benefits like stormwater reduction and energy savings. Multidisciplinary efforts leveraging simulations, ecosystem services valuation, and participatory community partnerships can advance context-appropriate green roof innovation and evidence-based policymaking to expand adoption in cities worldwide. Quantifying and communicating co-benefits are critical measures to drive wider implementation.

AB  - The contribution of distributed ledger technology (DLT) (e.g. blockchain) and smart contracts to the digitalisation and digital transformation of the construction sector is nascent but rapidly gaining traction. ‘Systematic reviews’ of DLT and smart contract applications that are specific to the construction sector are missing. This paper performs an extensive systematic review of 153 DLT and smart contract papers specific to the design, construction and operation of built assets. The protocols and processes of a systematic review were adopted to ensure full transparency, accountability, reproducibility, and updateability of the results. Through thematic analysis, we identify eight distinct themes of applications for DLT and smart contracts in construction: information management, payments, procurement, supply chain management, regulations and compliance, construction management and delivery, dispute resolution, and technological systems. Each theme identified was analysed to understand current capabilities, applications, and future developments. A cross-themes discussion revealed that DLT and smart contracts are ‘supplementary’ technologies that are used in combination with other technologies (e.g. BIM, IoT, cloud computing) as part of ‘technological systems’ that need to co-evolve in order to enable the themes' applications identified. Research into DLT and smart contracts in construction is rapidly moving from theoretical insights and frameworks into developing proofs-of-concept studies (27 studies) and testing them in case studies (20 studies). The next stage of research involving wider academic communities and industry-wide engagement is expected to begin uncovering the anticipated benefits of DLT and smart contracts through investments into technological systems and testing in real-world pilot studies. The discussion of the themes identified from technology, policy, process, and society perspectives exposed the need for an extended socio-technical approach to the solution in order to deliver the necessary change and impact from the adoption of DLT and smart contracts at speed and scale. The results of this systematic review provide a noteworthy reference point for academics, practitioners and policy makers interested in the future development of DLT and smart contract applications in construction.

Conventional in vivo and in vitro ADR identification methods are challenging, making computational alternatives vital for minimizing patient risk. This study evaluates the scientific outputs of computational approaches to predict ADRs associated with polypharmacy through bibliometric analysis. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed, which yielded 258 selected publications. Quantitative variable analysis was performed, and VosViewer was used to visualise networks and co-occurrences. The United States and China lead in publications, with ‘drug-drug interaction’ being the most frequent keyword. The Journal of Biomedical Informatics was ranked top, followed by BMC Bioinformatics and Briefings in Bioinformatics. The results indicate a growing global interest in computational methods for predicting adverse drug reactions associated with polypharmacy, primarily focusing on drug-drug interactions.

AB  - Abstract Digital transformation (DT) has become a buzzword, triggering different disciplines in research and influencing practice, which leads to independent research streams. Scholars investigate the antecedents, contingencies, and consequences of these disruptive technologies by examining the use of single technologies or of digitization, in general. Approaches are often very specialized and restricted to their domains. Thus, the immense breadth of technologies and their possible applications conditions a fragmentation of research, impeding a holistic view. With this systematic literature review, we aim to fill this gap in providing an overview of the different disciplines of DT research from a holistic business perspective. We identified the major research streams and clustered them with co-citation network analysis in nine main areas. Our research shows the main fields of interest in digital transformation research, overlaps of the research areas and fields that are still underrepresented. Within the business research areas, we identified three dominant areas in literature: finance, marketing, and innovation management. However, research streams also arise in terms of single branches like manufacturing or tourism. This study highlights these diverse research streams with the aim of deepening the understanding of digital transformation in research. Yet, research on DT still lacks in the areas of accounting, human resource management, and sustainability. The findings were distilled into a framework of the nine main areas for assisting the implications on potential research gaps on DT from a business perspective.

AB  - Horizon scanning for innovative technologies that might be applied to medical products and requires new assessment approaches to prepare regulators, allowing earlier access to the product for patients and an improved benefit/risk ratio. The purpose of this study is to confirm that citation network analysis and text mining for bibliographic information analysis can be used for horizon scanning of the rapidly developing field of AI-based medical technologies and extract the latest research trend information from the field. We classified 119,553 publications obtained from SCI constructed with the keywords "conventional," "machine-learning," or "deep-learning" and grouped them into 36 clusters, which demonstrated the academic landscape of AI applications. We also confirmed that one or two close clusters included the key articles on AI-based medical image analysis, suggesting that clusters specific to the technology were appropriately formed. Significant research progress could be detected as a quick increase in constituent papers and the number of citations of hub papers in the cluster. Then we tracked recent research trends by re-analyzing "young" clusters based on the average publication year of the constituent papers of each cluster. The latest topics in AI-based medical technologies include electrocardiograms and electroencephalograms (ECG/EEG), human activity recognition, natural language processing of clinical records, and drug discovery. We could detect rapid increase in research activity of AI-based ECG/EEG a few years prior to the issuance of the draft guidance by US-FDA. Our study showed that a citation network analysis and text mining of scientific papers can be a useful objective tool for horizon scanning of rapidly developing AI-based medical technologies.

AB  - This article provides a thorough bibliometric analysis of significant research trends in sustainability from 1988 until now, focusing on sustainable, healthy and digital buildings and cities. It exemplifies how research emphasis has shifted from explicit ecological investigations to nature-based solutions and city greening programs, with a rising interest in the many responsibilities of urban stakeholders in attaining sustainability. Despite weak integration at the literature and author cooperation levels, the “healthy buildings and cities” topic indicates promise for multidisciplinary integration. The “digital buildings and cities” topic, on the other hand, presents a more particular concern with strong cross-cluster collaboration and significant integration possibilities. Global relevance has been demonstrated through research on “sustainable buildings and cities,” mainly in journal papers. This topic’s study clusters show remarkable synergy across management, transportation, ecology, remote sensing and environmental engineering domains. In comparison to “healthy buildings and cities” and “digital buildings and cities” topics, the study of “sustainable buildings and cities” demonstrates a deeper level of interdisciplinary integration, highlighting the significant potential for further exploration within sustainability science research. This study emphasizes the ongoing worldwide relevance of sustainability science research and identifies significant opportunities for multidisciplinary integration across the investigated subjects.

AB  - E-learning studies are becoming very important today as they provide alternatives and support to all types of teaching and learning programs. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on educational systems has further increased the significance of e-learning. Accordingly, gaining a full understanding of the general topics and trends in e-learning studies is critical for a deeper comprehension of the field. There are many studies that provide such a picture of the e-learning field, but the limitation is that they do not examine the field as a whole. This study aimed to investigate the emerging trends in the e-learning field by implementing a topic modeling analysis based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) on 41,925 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2000 and 2019. The analysis revealed 16 topics reflecting emerging trends and developments in the e-learning field. Among these, the topics “MOOC,” “learning assessment,” and “e-learning systems” were found to be key topics in the field, with a consistently high volume. In addition, the topics of “learning algorithms,” “learning factors,” and “adaptive learning” were observed to have the highest overall acceleration, with the first two identified as having a higher acceleration in recent years. Going by these results, it is concluded that the next decade of e-learning studies will focus on learning factors and algorithms, which will possibly create a baseline for more individualized and adaptive mobile platforms. In other words, after a certain maturity level is reached by better understanding the learning process through these identified learning factors and algorithms, the next generation of e-learning systems will be built on individualized and adaptive learning environments. These insights could be useful for e-learning communities to improve their research efforts and their applications in the field accordingly.

AB  - Open innovation has recently emerged as an important concept in both academic research and industrial practice, and it is now also becoming increasingly important in the public policy field due to the innovation challenges in different domains, such as climate change, sustainability, and growth to name a few, but only in some value chains (i.e., automotive, manufacturing, aerospace). According to a report by McKinsey and Co., the construction industry lags behind others in adopting innovations; in fact, less than 1% of the construction industry’s revenue goes back into technology research and development. This work focuses on the current debate on the underdeveloped application of the open innovation (OI) approach to the construction sector. Namely, the foundational question is whether the OI model can be the answer to boosting innovation for the decarbonization of buildings. The research goal is to go a step further by analyzing its internal effectiveness, focusing on introducing and defining the Open Innovation Test Bed (OITB) concept. The study provides a systematic and bibliometric literature review of OI starting from a critical analysis of the concept definition and the evolution of the paradigm from the initial application to the first declination for the construction sector. All the steps analyzed allowed us to make an overall and comprehensive review of the OI concept, which is usually applied to other sectors, considering the ecosystem as the most effective declination of the OI paradigm for OITB development for building envelope solutions, thus providing answers to the two objectives identified in the introduction. Finally, the limitations of prior OI studies and the challenges for the OITB new construction paradigm are discussed, and we make recommendations for future opportunities and approach development to tackle and boost energy-efficient envelope solutions for the construction industries.

AB  - The transition from a linear economy (LE) to a circular economy (CE) is not just about mitigating the negative impacts of LE, but also about considering changes in infrastructure, while leveraging the power of technology to reduce resource production and consumption and waste generation, and improve long-term resilience. The existing research suggests that digital technologies (DTs) have great potential to drive the CE. However, despite the exponential growth and increasing interest in studies on DTs and the CE from year 2016 onwards, few systematic studies on the application of DTs to enable the CE have been found. In addition, the current status and development direction of the DT-driven CE is unclear, and the potential of DTs to support CE implementation is under-researched. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to explore the potential of DTs to drive the CE. This paper set out to analyze the current status and development of the DT-driven CE and examine future development trends in the field. Using a systematic literature review approach, this paper is the first attempt to use a mixed method, i.e., to combine macro-quantitative bibliometric methods with a micro-qualitative content analysis method to explore the DT-driven CE. The results, which include the research background, co-occurrence clusters, research hotspots, and development trends of keyword co-occurrence network visualization and keyword burst detection, are presented from a macro perspective using two bibliometric analysis softwares. In addition, the use of 13 specific DTs in the CE is analyzed according to seven disciplinary areas (Environmental Sciences and Ecology, Engineering, Science and Technology and Other Topics, Business Economics, Computer Science, Operations Research and Management Science, and Construction and Building Technology) of greatest interest from a micro-qualitative point of view. Further, future trends and challenges facing DT-driven CE development are explored and feasible directions for solutions are proposed.

AB  - The fusion of emerging technologies with industrial design has catalyzed a fundamental shift in the aesthetics, user experiences, and service frameworks of products in the Industry 4.0 era. Simultaneously, this convergence has heightened the demands placed on the technological integration competencies of designers. Consequently, there exists a necessity to articulate a precise developmental trajectory for proficiency in industrial design that incorporates these novel technologies. This study initiates with a bibliometric analysis to quantify the scholarly literature relevant to this research domain. Subsequently, leveraging the insights from this analysis, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 experts spanning the United States, Europe, South Korea, and China. Our conclusions show the following: (1) Co-word analysis and cluster analysis techniques are applied to identify 80 technologies and four technological clusters that demonstrate strong associations with industrial design in the Industry 4.0 era. (2) Employing coding techniques and thematic analysis, four distinct skill domains emerge for technology-integrated industrial design: Industrial Design Skills, Industrial Design Knowledge, Ethical Considerations in Industrial Design, and Industrial Design Industry Insight. Furthermore, a limitation that affects these competencies is identified. (3) A recommended methodology for assessing these competencies is proposed. This study represented an expansion upon existing industrial design competencies. The empirical data generated herein serves as a valuable resource for practitioners and educators within the field of industrial design. Furthermore, it provides a theoretical groundwork for future models addressing technology-infused industrial design capabilities.

AB  - The increasing social and environmental challenges, particularly poverty, have brought social entrepreneurship, a highly researched domain, to the attention of academicians. It has emerged as a critical issue in the context of economic development and societal well-being. The current study presents a comprehensive bibliometric analysis in the field of social entrepreneurship and poverty alleviation to explain the current state, geographical performance, and future research agenda. Utilizing VOS viewer (version 1.6.20) and R Studio software (version 4.3.2), 461 final articles were examined and extracted from the Web of Science database, covering the period from 1998 to 2022. The findings reveal a significant increase in research activity in this field since 2009, indicating a growing demand for it as a solution to social challenges. Notably, the years 2021–2022 witnessed a remarkable 55% surge in research output. The Sustainability Journal ranks first as the most productive source, followed by the Journal of Cleaner Production. The most prolific authors are Nina Kolleck from Germany, David Littlewood, and Diane Holt from the UK. Additionally, this study assesses the geographic distribution of research contributions, highlighting regions with relatively lower research performance, such as South Asian and African countries. Leading in this domain are the UK, Spain, the USA, and European institutions. Co-citation patterns reveal four thematic clusters: (1) dynamics of social entrepreneurship; (2) sustainable entrepreneurial ecosystem; (3) social entrepreneurship for social innovation; and (4) integrated sustainable entrepreneurship, shedding light on critical aspects and the intellectual structure of this domain. Finally, keyword co-occurrence analysis identifies emerging research areas, e.g., entrepreneurial development, the role of higher education, enterprise collaboration, inclusive growth, and socio-economic empowerment. This research provides valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners committed to achieving sustainable social change.

AB  - Abstract The detection of differences or similarities in large numbers of scientific publications is an open problem in scientometric research. In this paper we therefore develop and apply a machine learning approach based on structural topic modelling in combination with cosine similarity and a linear regression framework in order to identify differences in dissertation titles written at East and West German universities before and after German reunification. German reunification and its surrounding time period is used because it provides a structure with both minor and major differences in research topics that could be detected by our approach. Our dataset is based on dissertation titles in economics and business administration and chemistry from 1980 to 2010. We use university affiliation and year of the dissertation to train a structural topic model and then test the model on a set of unseen dissertation titles. Subsequently, we compare the resulting topic distribution of each title to every other title with cosine similarity. The cosine similarities and the regional and temporal origin of the dissertation titles they come from are then used in a linear regression approach. Our results on research topics in economics and business administration suggest substantial differences between East and West Germany before the reunification and a rapid conformation thereafter. In chemistry we observe minor differences between East and West before the reunification and a slightly increased similarity thereafter.

AB  - PVC is widely used in packaging, electrical insulation, and medical devices due to its versatility owing to its resistance, incombustible and barrier properties as well as affordable cost. In the present study, bibliometric and co-occurrence analyses are proposed to identify trends, gaps, future directions, and challenges regarding process system engineering (PSE) applied to the production process of PVC using VOSviewer as a tool for analyzing the data obtained from SCOPUS. A mapping of different topics alluding to simulation of PVC production was provided to gain a better insight into the development of the topic and its progression. The findings indicate that the literature on this topic falls into five different clusters: modeling and simulation of PVC production, process control and optimization, and optimization strategies of the process. From a co-occurrence study we identified that mathematics and statistics applied to polymer chemistry, separation phenomena, and polymer production are the main areas of interest for further research. The trends suggest that Monte Carlo and numerical simulation can contribute to a deeper understanding of PVC's properties and behavior. In addition, the focus on plastics and microplastics reflects concerns about the environmental impact. A bibliometric study evidenced that PSE provides the tools for improvement in PVC production processes by employing advanced process engineering techniques. Modelling and new algorithms for simulation methods of continuous polymerization processes are important to enhance accuracy and efficiency across various applications. The study also proposes a research agenda for future researchers working in the field of the use of PSE applied to the PVC production process.

AB  - There have been many attempts to transform cities into smart cities worldwide. However, it is difficult to understand and describe smart cities from different perspectives, given the widespread application of the concept of smart city in diverse disciplines, such as urban planning, electronic engineering, and computer sciences. This work conducted a comprehensive smart city literature review based on text mining of 3,315 papers on smart cities published in journals indexed in the Science Citation Index Expanded and Social Sciences Citation Index databases. These include "all papers" classified as research articles published from 1999 to April 2020. Our findings show the state of the art of research on smart cities, including (i) smart city literature statistics from 1999 to 2019, (ii) 23 research topics related to smart cities, and (iii) geographical variations in smart-city research. Based on these findings, we offer theoretical and practical implications of (1) missing fields of studies, (2) future research directions, and (3) the applicability of text-mining techniques to literature reviews. We believe that this work, which aims to establish a common ground for understanding smart cities from multiple disciplinary perspectives, will encourage further research and development regarding smart cities.

AB  - In response to the growing popularity of social web apps, much research has gone into analyzing and developing an AI-based responsive suggestion system. Machine learning and neural networks come in many forms that help online students choose the best texts for their studies. However, when training recommendation models to deal with massive amounts of data, traditional machine learning approaches require additional training models. As a result, they are deemed inappropriate for the personalized recommender generation of learning systems. In this paper, we examine LSTM-based strategies in order to make useful recommendations for future research.

AB  - Coastal regions, increasingly threatened by floods due to climate-change-driven extreme weather, lack a comprehensive study that integrates coastal and riverine flood dynamics. In response to this research gap, we conducted a comprehensive bibliometric analysis and thorough visualization and mapping of studies of compound flooding risk in coastal cities over the period 2014–2022, using VOSviewer and CiteSpace to analyze 407 publications in the Web of Science Core Collection database. The analytical results reveal two persistent research topics: the way to explore the return periods or joint probabilities of flood drivers using statistical modeling, and the quantification of flood risk with different return periods through numerical simulation. This article examines critical causes of compound coastal flooding, outlines the principal methodologies, details each method’s features, and compares their strengths, limitations, and uncertainties. This paper advocates for an integrated approach encompassing climate change, ocean–land systems, topography, human activity, land use, and hazard chains to enhance our understanding of flood risk mechanisms. This includes adopting an Earth system modeling framework with holistic coupling of Earth system components, merging process-based and data-driven models, enhancing model grid resolution, refining dynamical frameworks, comparing complex physical models with more straightforward methods, and exploring advanced data assimilation, machine learning, and quasi-real-time forecasting for researchers and emergency responders.

AB  - Eating disorders (EDs) are a growing concern affecting millions worldwide. Early detection and treatment are crucial, but stigma can prevent people from seeking help. Primary care providers can play a critical role in early detection by coordinating care with other professionals. Understanding the research landscape on EDs, primary care, and stigma is essential for identifying knowledge gaps to direct future research and improve management. In this study, we aimed to analyze the scientific trends and patterns in research about EDs, primary care, and stigma. A bibliometric analysis was conducted using the Web of Science database to collect articles published between May 1986 and May 2023. Bibliometric indicators were utilized to examine authorship, collaboration patterns, and influential papers. Topic analysis was performed to identify stigma-related terms within the dataset. A total of 541 research articles were analyzed, and it was found that the average number of publications per year has increased linearly from nearly zero in 1986 to 41 in 2022. One of the study's main findings is that despite this linear increase over the years, the subject of stigma did not take a prominent place in the literature. Only a few stigma concepts could be identified with the topic analysis. The authors in the field are also interested in; screening, neurotic symptoms, training, adolescent, obesity-related conditions, and family. One-third of all publications were from 15 journals. However, only two of them were primary healthcare journals. Leading authors' collaborations were another critical finding from the network analysis. This may help to expand primary care related EDs research to end the mental health stigma. This study provides insights into the research trends and patterns regarding eating disorders, primary care, and stigma. Our findings highlight the need to address primary care's impact and stigma on EDs. The identified research gaps can guide future studies to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of eating disorders in primary care settings.

However, the translation of these innovations into clinical practice is still lagging behind. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the current state of research and to predict the future directions of applied PGx in the field of precision oncology as represented by the targeted therapy class of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Advanced bibliometric and scientometric analyses of the literature were performed. The Scopus database was used for the search, and articles published between 2001 and 2023 were extracted. Information about productivity, citations, cluster analysis, keyword co-occurrence, trend topics, and thematic evolution were generated. A total of 448 research articles were included in this analysis. A burst of scholarly activity in the field was noted by the year 2005, peaking in 2017, followed by a remarkable decline to date. Research in the field was hallmarked by consistent and impactful international collaboration, with the US leading in terms of most prolific country, institutions, and total link strength. Thematic evolution in the field points in the direction of more specialized studies on applied pharmacokinetics of available and novel TKIs, particularly for the treatment of lung and breast cancers. Our results delineate a significant advancement in the field of PGx in precision oncology. Notwithstanding the practical challenges to these applications at the point of care, further research, standardization, infrastructure development, and informed policymaking are urgently needed to ensure widespread adoption of PGx.

AB  - The article aims to identify the most influential authors and publications in the research area of hydrogen supply chains. The analysis of the European Union’s strategic documents and hydrogen strategies announced by individual countries indicate that using hydrogen in the economy is becoming significantly more important. Therefore, scientists exploring the above topics in various research settings and scopes should also expect growing interest. The hydrogen economy, including hydrogen supply chains (HSC) as a tool for its implementation, is still a relatively young and dynamic research area. This applies especially to the so-called green hydrogen supply chains where the hydrogen feedstock is the renewable energy source. This work is intended to facilitate the identification of the most essential items of already published scientific works. The work carried out a bibliometric analysis for the research area “hydrogen supply chains”. As a result of the research, the following were identified: (1) the most frequently cited publications and their authors, (2) the journals and authors that had the most significant impact on research in a given area, (3) the publications to be which are most often referred to by authors writing works in the field of HSC, and (4) changes in the importance of places of publication and authors over time. Due to the complexity of the research issues, it is crucial to determine the most significant scientific achievements to date. This should constitute the basic cognitive base for properly implementing newly undertaken research: the hydrogen supply chain.

AB  - Abstract The successful irruption of AI-based technology in our daily lives has led to a growing educational, social, and political interest in training citizens in AI. Education systems now need to train students at the K-12 level to live in a society where they must interact with AI. Thus, AI literacy is a pedagogical and cognitive challenge at the K-12 level. This study aimed to understand how AI is being integrated into K-12 education worldwide. We conducted a search process following the systematic literature review method using Scopus. 179 documents were reviewed, and two broad groups of AI literacy approaches were identified, namely learning experience and theoretical perspective. The first group covered experiences in learning technical, conceptual and applied skills in a particular domain of interest. The second group revealed that significant efforts are being made to design models that frame AI literacy proposals. There were hardly any experiences that assessed whether students understood AI concepts after the learning experience. Little attention has been paid to the undesirable consequences of an indiscriminate and insufficiently thought-out application of AI. A competency framework is required to guide the didactic proposals designed by educational institutions and define a curriculum reflecting the sequence and academic continuity, which should be modular, personalized and adjusted to the conditions of the schools. Finally, AI literacy can be leveraged to enhance the learning of disciplinary core subjects by integrating AI into the teaching process of those subjects, provided the curriculum is co-designed with teachers.

AB  - The complexity of data has burgeoned to such an extent that scientists of every realm are encountering the incessant challenge of data management. Modern-day analytical approaches with the help of free source tools and programming languages have facilitated access to the context of the various domains as well as specific works reported. Here, with this article, an attempt has been made to provide a systematic analysis of all the available reports at PubMed on Proteome using text mining. The work is comprised of scientometrics as well as information extraction to provide the publication trends as well as frequent keywords, bioconcepts and most importantly gene–gene co-occurrence network. Out of 33,028 PMIDs collected initially, the segregation of 24,350 articles under 28 Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) was analyzed and plotted. Keyword link network and density visualizations were provided for the top 1000 frequent Mesh keywords. PubTator was used, and 322,026 bioconcepts were able to extracted under 10 classes (such as Gene, Disease, CellLine, etc.). Co-occurrence networks were constructed for PMID-bioconcept as well as bioconcept–bioconcept associations. Further, for creation of subnetwork with respect to gene–gene co-occurrence, a total of 11,100 unique genes participated with mTOR and AKT showing the highest (64) number of connections. The gene p53 was the most popular one in the network in accordance with both the degree and weighted degree centrality, which were 425 and 1414, respectively. The present piece of study is an amalgam of bibliometrics and scientific data mining methods looking deeper into the whole scale analysis of available literature on proteome.

AB  - Communication consists of both meta-information as well as content. Currently, the automated analysis of such data often focuses either on the network aspects via social network analysis or on the content, utilizing methods from text-mining. However, the first category of approaches does not leverage the rich content information, while the latter ignores the conversation environment and the temporal evolution, as evident in the meta-information. In contradiction to communication research, which stresses the importance of a holistic approach, both aspects are rarely applied simultaneously, and consequently, their combination has not yet received enough attention in automated analysis systems. In this work, we aim to address this challenge by discussing the difficulties and design decisions of such a path as well as contribute CommAID, a blueprint for a holistic strategy to communication analysis. It features an integrated visual analytics design to analyze communication networks through dynamics modeling, semantic pattern retrieval, and a user-adaptable and problem-specific machine learning-based retrieval system. An interactive multi-level matrix-based visualization facilitates a focused analysis of both network and content using inline visuals supporting cross-checks and reducing context switches. We evaluate our approach in both a case study and through formative evaluation with eight law enforcement experts using a real-world communication corpus. Results show that our solution surpasses existing techniques in terms of integration level and applicability. With this contribution, we aim to pave the path for a more holistic approach to communication analysis.

AB  - This literature review explores the existing work and practices in applying thematic analysis natural language processing techniques to financial data in cloud environments. This work aims to improve two of the five Vs of the big data system. We used the PRISMA approach (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) for the review. We analyzed the research papers published over the last 10 years about the topic in question using a keyword-based search and bibliometric analysis. The systematic literature review was conducted in multiple phases, and filters were applied to exclude papers based on the title and abstract initially, then based on the methodology/conclusion, and, finally, after reading the full text. The remaining papers were then considered and are discussed here. We found that automated data discovery methods can be augmented by applying an NLP-based thematic analysis on the financial data in cloud environments. This can help identify the correct classification/categorization and measure data quality for a sentiment analysis.

AB  - Water environment health assessment is one of the vital fields closely related to the quality of human life. The change of material contained in water will lead to the reflectance change of hyperspectral remote sensing data. According to this phenomenon, the water quality parameters are calculated to achieve the purpose of water quality monitoring. Series knowledge graphs in this field are drawn after analyzing 564 publications from WOS (Web of Science) and EI (The Engineering Index) databases since 1994 with the support of VOSviewer and CiteSpace. Including statistics of documents publication time, contribution analysis, the influence of publications and journals, and the influence of funding institutions. It is concluded that the research trend of hyperspectral water quality monitoring is the machine learning algorithm based on UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) hyperspectral instrument data by analyzing scientific research cooperation, keyword analysis, and research hotspots. The whole picture of the research is obtained in this field from four subfields: application scenarios, data sources, water quality parameters, and monitoring algorithms in this paper. It is summarized that the miniaturization, integration, and intelligence of hyperspectral sensors will be the research trend in the next 10 years or even longer. The conclusions have significant reference values for this field.

AB  - The increasingly massive amount and open access of literature provide a data foundation for technology insight based on big data analysis. This paper proposed a new technology insight framework -Technology Dependency Graph (TDG). Firstly, an adversarial multitask learning and distantly-supervised learning were applied to extract the technology entity and dependency relation with limited labeled sample. Then, a TDG was constructed with the entities as vertices and the dependency relations as edges. A TDG contains rich and valuable semantic information which represents the support, contribution or relying on relationship between technologies. At the same time, the social network properties of TDG allow researchers to analyze and mine hot topics, key technologies, and technology architecture by using network theories, methods and tools. In the case study, the TDG of DSSC (dye-sensitized solar cell) was constructed. Furthermore, the technology dependency architecture for DSSC was constructed according to a spanning tree out of the TDG, which provides a global perspective for the research of DSSC.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly transformed the medical field, especially in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of oncological diseases. It has had a profound impact on clinical decision-making and has enhanced the quality of life for various populations. This study aims to comprehensively assess the inherent relationship between AI and medicine and to uncover both its positive and negative implications. To achieve a comprehensive understanding, a thorough systematic review of articles was conducted, examining a total of 80 papers published between 2017 and 2023. These articles were carefully selected from well-known open-access databases, such as Scopus, IOPscience, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, and ProQuest. A key finding from this review is that the majority of research on this topic has been published in scientific journals ranked in the first-quartile (Q1), underscoring the importance and high quality of research in this field. The United States, China, India, the United Kingdom, and Canada are the foremost countries in publishing on this topic. Most of the research is published in first-quartile (Q1) journals, representing 51% of the studies. Only 1% of articles appear in third-quartile (Q3) journals. IEEE Xplore is renowned as the primary database for accessing high-impact studies in this field. Future research should prioritize investigating the long-term impact of AI on patient clinical outcomes. International collaborative research could promote innovation and fairness in the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in oncology.

AB  - The growth in the number of social media users has resulted in a corresponding rise in the spread of hate speech on these platforms, leading to a growing, but little studied, problem. The bibliometric study aimed to examine the research trend and identify the most productive authors, the most active institutions, the leading countries and the most employed virtual hate speech control mechanisms by analyzing 576 relevant publications from the Scopus database published between 2016-2022. The findings showed an increase in publication and India as a leading country/region in research on virtual hate speech control mechanisms. Deep learning and natural language processing systems were identified as the most commonly used control mechanisms. Based on the results, it is recommended that future researchers focus on multidisciplinary collaboration and valid mechanisms for different languages. This paper provides a general overview of the current state of research in this field and serves as a guide for authors and institutions in their research and collaboration strategies.

AB  - Abstract Big data innovation is a key instrument for economic and social development and for the creation of new business opportunities. This study analyzes the patenting activities of global jurisdictions in the field of big data; as well as the scholarly cited works. We collected 13,112 patent applications between 1992 and 2019, and 642 cited scholarly works by the patents. Our findings report on the development trends in big data technologies, as well as on the link between patenting activities and the cited scientific works. It also analyzes and visualizes the social networks embedded in patents and the cited scientific works; thus, it reveals the patenting activities of global jurisdictions on big data technologies, the strength of the interaction of various agents, such as inventors and applicants within social networks, and the link between patents and the scientific world. This study shows that most of the big data patent applications filed fall within the IPC category of information retrieval, database structures, and file system structures. The majority of the applicants and inventors of the patents filed are Chinese companies and individuals. Scientific fields with stronger connections within the network of co-fields are computer science and medicine. There is a weak link between inventions and scientific works.

AB  - In December 2019, a novel virus named COVID-19 emerged in the city of Wuhan, China. In early 2020, the COVID-19 virus spread in all continents of the world except Antarctica, causing widespread infections and deaths due to its contagious characteristics and no medically proven treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has been termed as the most consequential global crisis since the World Wars. The first line of defense against the COVID-19 spread are the non-pharmaceutical measures like social distancing and personal hygiene. The great pandemic affecting billions of lives economically and socially has motivated the scientific community to come up with solutions based on computer-aided digital technologies for diagnosis, prevention, and estimation of COVID-19. Some of these efforts focus on statistical and Artificial Intelligence-based analysis of the available data concerning COVID-19. All of these scientific efforts necessitate that the data brought to service for the analysis should be open source to promote the extension, validation, and collaboration of the work in the fight against the global pandemic. Our survey is motivated by the open source efforts that can be mainly categorized as

AB  - As technology becomes more sophisticated so do cyber-attacks. The resilience of electronic commerce organisations represents a critical point nowadays because it influences consumer and digital business behaviour. In this context, the cybersecurity and electronic commerce knowledge were reviewed as a unit. The main aim of this paper is to support researchers and managers in understanding the theoretical framework and to provide a knowledge-based model. To achieve this aim, the authors performed an analysis of 14,585 papers from the Web of Science Core Collection that generated two visualized networks, analyzed with the metrics mean silhouette, modularity, betweenness centrality, and citation bursts in the context of digital resilience. The mapping process results show that the human factor represents the central junction with the fear of cyber-attacks and the perception of online shopping as risky. The adoption of electronic commerce and mobile commerce are two challenging research lines in the global economic resilience. Their adoption enabled by big data, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and even blockchain technology can strengthen resilience even when cybersecurity education is needed.

AB  - With the advent of the Industry 4.0 era, information technology has been widely developed and applied in the construction engineering field. Text mining techniques can extract interesting and important data hidden in plain text, potentially allowing problems in the construction field to be addressed. Although text mining techniques have been used in the construction field for many years, there is a lack of recent reviews focused on their development and application from a literature analysis perspective; therefore, we conducted a review with the aim of filling this gap. We use a combination of bibliometric and manual literature analyses to systematically review the text mining-based literature related to the construction field from 1997 to 2022. Specifically, publication analysis, collaboration analysis, co-citation analysis, and keyword analysis were conducted on 185 articles collected from the SCOPUS database. Based on a read-through of the 185 papers, the current research topics in text mining were manually determined and sorted, including tasks and methods, application areas, and core methods and algorithms. The presented results provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state of TM techniques, thereby contributing to the further development of TM techniques in the construction industry.

AB  - Grassland remote sensing (GRS) is an important research topic that applies remote sensing technology to grassland ecosystems, reflects the number of grassland resources and grassland health promptly, and provides inversion information used in sustainable development management. A scientometrics analysis based on Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-E) was performed to understand the research trends and areas of focus in GRS research studies. A total of 2692 papers related to GRS research studies and 82,208 references published from 1980 to 2020 were selected as the research objects. A comprehensive overview of the field based on the annual documents, research areas, institutions, influential journals, core authors, and temporal trends in keywords were presented in this study. The results showed that the annual number of documents increased exponentially, and more than 100 papers were published each year since 2010. Remote sensing, environmental sciences, and ecology were the most popular Web of Science research areas. The journal Remote Sensing was one of the most popular for researchers to publish documents and shows high development and publishing potential in GRS research studies. The institution with the greatest research documents and most citations was the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Guo X.L., Hill M.J., and Zhang L. were the most productive authors across the 40-year study period in terms of the number of articles published. Seven clusters of research areas were identified that generated contributions to this topic by keyword co-occurrence analysis. We also detected 17 main future directions of GRS research studies by document co-citation analysis. Emerging or underutilized methodologies and technologies, such as unmanned aerial systems (UASs), cloud computing, and deep learning, will continue to further enhance GRS research in the process of achieving sustainable development goals.

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of sliding mode control (SMC) for a type of uncertain time-delay nonlinear descriptor systems represented by T-S fuzzy models. One crucial contributing factor is to put forward a novel integral fuzzy switching manifold involved with time delay. Compared with previous results, the key benefit of the new manifold is that the input matrices via different subsystems are permitted to be diverse, and thus much more applicability will be achieved. By resorting to Frobenius' theorem and double orthogonal complement, the existence condition of the fuzzy manifold is presented. The admissibility conditions of sliding motion with a strictly dissipative performance are further provided. Then, the desired fuzzy SMC controller is synthesized by analyzing the reachability of the manifold. Moreover, an adaptive fuzzy SMC controller is also proposed to adapt the input saturation and the matched uncertainty with unknown upper bounds. The feasibility and virtue of our theoretical findings are demonstrated by a fuzzy SMC controller implementation for a practical system about the pendulum.

AB  - Wind energy has emerged as a highly promising source of renewable energy in recent times. However, wind turbines regularly suffer from operational inconsistencies, leading to significant costs and challenges in operations and maintenance (O&M). Condition-based monitoring (CBM) and performance assessment/analysis of turbines are vital aspects for ensuring efficient O&M planning and cost minimisation. Data-driven decision making techniques have witnessed rapid evolution in the wind industry for such O&M tasks during the last decade, from applying signal processing methods in early 2010 to artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, especially deep learning in 2020. In this article, we utilise statistical computing to present a scientometric review of the conceptual and thematic evolution of AI in the wind energy sector, providing evidence-based insights into present strengths and limitations of data-driven decision making in the wind industry. We provide a perspective into the future and on current key challenges in data availability and quality, lack of transparency in black box-natured AI models, and prevailing issues in deploying models for real-time decision support, along with possible strategies to overcome these problems. We hope that a systematic analysis of the past, present and future of CBM and performance assessment can encourage more organisations to adopt data-driven decision making techniques in O&M towards making wind energy sources more reliable, contributing to the global efforts of tackling climate change.

AB  - Defect detection in software is the procedure to identify parts of software that may comprise defects. Software companies always seek to improve the performance of software projects in terms of quality and efficiency. They also seek to deliver the soft-ware projects without any defects to the communities and just in time. The early revelation of defects in software projects is also tried to avoid failure of those projects, save costs, team effort, and time. Therefore, these companies need to build an intelligent model capable of detecting software defects accurately and efficiently. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the materials and methods, PRISMA, search questions, and search strategy. Section 3 presents the results with an analysis, and discussion, visualizing analysis and analysis per topic. Section 4 presents the methodology. Finally, in Section 5, the conclusion is discussed. The search string was applied to all electronic repositories looking for papers published between 2015 and 2021, which resulted in 627 publications. The results focused on finding three important points by linking the results of manuscript analysis and linking them to the results of the bibliometric analysis. First, the results showed that the number of defects and the number of lines of code are among the most important factors used in revealing software defects. Second, neural networks and regression analysis are among the most important smart and statistical methods used for this purpose. Finally, the accuracy metric and the error rate are among the most important metrics used in comparisons between the efficiency of statistical and intelligent models.

AB  - Given the pressures of internation-al market competition, the dual constraints of domestic resources and the environment, and the uncertainties posed by climate change, bolstering agricultural infra-structure construction is a realistic demand and a crucial approach for implementing emerging grain security strat-egies, particularly in developing countries. Facility agriculture is characterized as a modern agricultural production mode that improves or creates favorable environmental conditions within a specific locality. With the rapid expansion of large-scale facility agriculture, there has been an increased demand for various types of energy, including electricity, gas, cold, and heat. Agricultural lighting equipment used in facility agriculture is a modern agricultural technique that applies engineering technology to regulate light supplementation in the production process. Facility lighting offers several advantages over traditional methods, such as higher photovoltaic conversion efficiency, adjustable spectrum, high photosynthetic efficiency, energy efficiency, environmental friendliness, long lifespan, monochromatic light, cold light source, and compact size. Promoting national food security, carbon neutrality, returning farmland to forests, and implementing low-carbon green agricultural policies all contribute to the favorable use of facility agriculture lighting. This study aims to provide a systematic summary of the relevant research conducted in the past decade using Citespace software. The advantage of facility agriculture for carbon sequestration capacity can effectively reduce net carbon emissions from facility agricultural production activities. In addition, the combination of agriculture and the Internet of Things can effectively improve agricultural production efficiency and economic returns. Combining artificial intelligence and other technologies with facility agriculture engineering, based on multi-source data fusion, intelligent early warning for facility agriculture energy internet can be used to prevent agricultural meteorological disasters. More importantly, it helps maintain global food security, eliminate hunger, and reduce economic inequality. The findings of this study will contribute to a deeper understanding of agricultural lighting equipment, serving as a new theoretical foundation for achieving agricultural emission reduction targets and promoting agricultural technical cooperation.

We identified that the most widely used AND solving approaches are author grouping associated with similarity functions and clustering methods and some works using author assignment allied to classification methods. The countries that publish most in AND are the USA, China, Germany, and Brazil with 21%, 19%, 13% and 8% of the total papers, respectively. The review results provide an overview of AND state-of-the-art research that can direct further investigation based on the quantitative and qualitative information from the AND research history.

AB  - Technology is being developed to handle vast amounts of complex data from diverse sources. The terms "Big Data" and "Decision Support Systems" (DSS) refer to computerised multidimensional data management systems that support stakeholders in making use of modern data-driven approaches to identify and solve problems and to enable enhanced decision making. Big Data has become ubiquitous in food safety. Information in the food supply chain is scattered and involves heterogenicity in format, scale, geographical origin. Also, interactions among environmental factors, food contamination, and foodborne diseases are complex, dynamic, and challenging to predict. Therefore, this state-of-the-art review article focuses on the underlying architecture of Big Data and web-based technologies for food safety, focusing on climate change influences. Challenges in adopting Big Data in food safety are presented, and future research directions regarding technologies/methods in the food supply chain are summarised and analysed. The analysis and discussion provided aim to assist agri-food researchers and stakeholders in taking initiatives and gathering insights on the application of Big Data and web-based DSS for food safety, which would alleviate challenges and facilitate the implementation of Big Data in food safety risk assessment while considering the possible implications of climate change.

AB  - Scientific conferences are essential for developing active research communities, promoting the cross-pollination of ideas and technologies, bridging between academia and industry, and disseminating new findings. Analyzing and monitoring scientific conferences is thus crucial for all users who need to take informed decisions in this space. However, scholarly search engines and bibliometric applications only provide a limited set of analytics for assessing research conferences, preventing us from performing a comprehensive analysis of these events. In this paper, we introduce the AIDA Dashboard, a novel web application, developed in collaboration with Springer Nature, for analyzing and comparing scientific conferences. This tool introduces three major new features: 1) it enables users to easily compare conferences within specific fields (e.g., Digital Libraries) and time-frames (e.g., the last five years); 2) it characterises conferences according to a 14K research topics from the Computer Science Ontology (CSO); and 3) it provides several functionalities for assessing the involvement of commercial organizations, including the ability to characterize industrial contributions according to 66 industrial sectors (e.g., automotive, financial, energy, electronics) from the Industrial Sectors Ontology (INDUSO). We evaluated the AIDA Dashboard by performing both a quantitative evaluation and a user study, obtaining excellent results in terms of quality of the analytics and usability.

AB  - Abstract Background COVID-19 is the most rapidly expanding coronavirus outbreak in the past 2 decades. To provide a swift response to a novel outbreak, prior knowledge from similar outbreaks is essential. Results Here, we study the volume of research conducted on previous coronavirus outbreaks, specifically SARS and MERS, relative to other infectious diseases by analyzing &amp;gt;35 million articles from the past 20 years. Our results demonstrate that previous coronavirus outbreaks have been understudied compared with other viruses. We also show that the research volume of emerging infectious diseases is very high after an outbreak and decreases drastically upon the containment of the disease. This can yield inadequate research and limited investment in gaining a full understanding of novel coronavirus management and prevention. Conclusions Independent of the outcome of the current COVID-19 outbreak, we believe that measures should be taken to encourage sustained research in the field.

AB  - The scientific and technological progresses of the chemical and materials science disciplines lead to a significant amount of numerical and textual data stored in the published papers and databases, which can now be efficiently handled via the text mining process and employed for new chemical and materials discovery and machine learning-assisted analysis. In this manuscript, we review recent progresses of the text mining-assisted materials researches, with a special attention on the energy materials. The text mining process, facilitated by the development of machine learning methods, efficiently establishes hidden relationships and predicts new energy material candidates, including those for solar cells, thermoelectrics, batteries and catalysts. The word vectorization method (word embedding), such as word2vec, is especially efficient for the materials science researches. In addition, the text mining process assists the understanding of the energy and materials technologies and industries. Suggestions to better utilize the text mining techniques for the chemical and materials researches are provided. This manuscript is expected to facilitate the progress of the chemical and material researches via the text-mining method.

AB  - Today, one can observe shifts in the research landscape, which is formed by digitization and open science principles. The open science movement continues to gain momentum, attention and debate. In parallel with the principle of unity, open science gives rise to a taxonomy of several related ideas, guidelines and concepts, such as open access, open replicable research and open data. Over the past fifteen years, research institutions have focused on open access to publications. However, recently the focus of attention has shifted to research data as a “new currency” in research activities and their distribution in open access, and the guiding principles of data management are becoming crucial for the wide implementation of open science practices and the effective use of data in research, industry, business and other sectors of the economy. In this context, it is relevant to carry out a thorough study of primary scientific works on open science issues and to study the role of the concept of “open research data” in the paradigm of a holistic ecosystem of open science and business ecosystem. In this work, it is proposed to use the methods of quantitative and qualitative bibliometric analysis, which allows to identify the main trends and form the basis for further research. The information base for this work was the international scientometric database Scopus, which enables to analyze bibliographic data using built-in tools and import them for external use in the VOSviewer software. The study revealed an increasing trend in the number of publications on the subject under study, with the highest annual growth rate in 2017 (76%) and 2019 (66%). Qualitative bibliographic analysis made it possible to analyze the most cited and, therefore, trending works on the selected topic. In terms of the number of citations per year, the results show that the studies with such directions in open science as open program code (open source); data/research reproducibility, research data management; open access to publications (open access) are most popular. In addition, a cluster analysis of the co-prevalence of keywords was conducted. It formed clusters dedicated to both institutional and infrastructural problems of the development of open science and research data. Separately, the results of the analysis create a scientific basis for further research into the key determinants of the effectiveness of the implementation of a proper research data management system at the micro, meso, and macro levels. It will improve the effectiveness of the implementation of scientific developments from one field of knowledge to another, while achieving increased interdisciplinary research. In parallel with this, interested persons of the real sector of the economy get the opportunity to analyze scientific results, determining the possibility of their adoption in their own activities.

AB  - Abstract Identifying the evolution path of a research field is essential to scientific and technological innovation. There have been many attempts to identify the technology evolution path based on the topic model or social networks analysis, but many of them had deficiencies in methodology. First, many studies have only considered a single type of information (text or citation information) in scientific literature, which may lead to incomplete technology path mapping. Second, the number of topics in each period cannot be determined automatically, making dynamic topic tracking difficult. Third, data mining methods fail to be effectively combined with visual analysis, which will affect the efficiency and flexibility of mapping. In this study, we developed a method for mapping the technology evolution path using a novel non-parametric topic model, the citation involved Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (CIHDP), to achieve better topic detection and tracking of scientific literature. To better present and analyze the path, D3.js is used to visualize the splitting and fusion of the evolutionary path. We used this novel model to mapping the artificial intelligence research domain, through a successful mapping of the evolution path, the proposed method’s validity and merits are shown. After incorporating the citation information, we found that the CIHDP can be mapping a complete path evolution process and had better performance than the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process and LDA. This method can be helpful for understanding and analyzing the development of technical topics. Moreover, it can be well used to map the science or technology of the innovation ecosystem. It may also arouse the interest of technology evolution path researchers or policymakers.

AB  - Purpose: Given the rise of big data and use of analytics, this study explores how the performance measurement systems research field has incorporated dynamic aspects and digitalization prevalent in rapidly changing and competitive environments.Design/methodology/approach: In the study we conduct a software supported and iterative systematic literature review of the performance management field together with a keyword network analysis.The meta-analysis provided a quantitative method that identified gaps and directions.Findings: The findings suggest there is a link between performance measurement systems and dynamics, but the link is weak, and the main research does not incorporate dynamic elements.There is an observable research community interest in managing information for informed decisions through digitalization.However, two broad research perspectives on performance management systems in highly dynamic and competitive environments were identified, one group exploring dynamic conditions, and the other digital technologies and optimization.Researchers positioning themselves in the dynamic subgroup are likely take an organizational or human capital perspective when exploring applications of performance management systems, while the other group mainly pursues research within artificial intelligence, automatization, and optimization.There is limited research with coverage of both groups, ABOUT THE AUTHORS Jonatan Sahlin is a researcher at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) where he investigates how rapidly changing business environments affect companies' operations strategically, and how performance management systems can support such operations.In parallel he is a business developer in strategy and commercial excellence at a multinational corporation working on digitalization and strategic level business development toward market leading retailers.

AB  - The worldwide web is an extraordinary resource for gaining access to information of all kinds.Each day a greater number of resources become available online.The advantages that internet offers researchers are tremendous; so much that some may be tempted to bypass the library entirely and conduct all their research on the web.In spite of this, the enquirers are being confronted with information overloaded with noise which the conventional search methods lack the capability to tackle.Existing search engines such as Google, Yahoo and Bing often return a long list of results which forces users to sift through it to find relevant documents; thereby making search for information difficult.This paper takes a critical study of document tracking and classification systems and presents a Neuro-fuzzy based model for classification of search results based on the strength of words in the query.The structured systems analysis and design methodology and the neuro-fuzzy clustering technique were employed to study and classify the documents into groups of similar topics for specific knowledge.The work built an adaptive intelligent information retrieval system which will cluster internet documents into similar topic using an unsupervised machine learning techniques to reduce the percentage of irrelevant documents that are retrieved and presented to users.

AB  - Federated Learning (FL), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) are the most trending and exciting technology in the intelligent healthcare field. Traditionally, the healthcare system works based on centralized agents sharing their raw data. Therefore, huge vulnerabilities and challenges are still existing in this system. However, integrating with AI, the system would be multiple agent collaborators who are capable of communicating with their desired host efficiently. Again, FL is another interesting feature, which works decentralized manner; it maintains the communication based on a model in the preferred system without transferring the raw data. The combination of FL, AI, and XAI techniques can be capable of minimizing several limitations and challenges in the healthcare system. This paper presents a complete analysis of FL using AI for smart healthcare applications. Initially, we discuss contemporary concepts of emerging technologies such as FL, AI, XAI, and the healthcare system. We integrate and classify the FL-AI with healthcare technologies in different domains. Further, we address the existing problems, including security, privacy, stability, and reliability in the healthcare field. In addition, we guide the readers to solving strategies of healthcare using FL and AI. Finally, we address extensive research areas as well as future potential prospects regarding FL-based AI research in the healthcare management system.

AB  - Membrane distillation (MD) is proposed as an environmentally friendly technology of emerging interest able to aid in the resolution of the worldwide water issue and brine processing by producing distilled water and treating high-saline solutions up to their saturation with a view toward reaching zero liquid discharge (ZLD) at relatively low temperature requirements and a low operating hydrostatic pressure. Topic modeling (TM), which is a Machine Learning (ML) method combined with Natural Language Processing (NLP), is a customizable approach that is ideal for researching massive datasets with unknown themes. In this study, we used BERTopic, a new cutting-edge Python library for topic modeling, to explore the global and local themes in the MD separation literature. By using the BERTopic model, the words describing the collected dataset were detected together with over- and underexplored research topics to guide MD researchers in planning their future works. The results indicated that two global themes are widely discussed and are relevant to MD scientists abroad. In brief, these topics are permeate flux, heat-energy recovery, surface modification, and polyvinylidene fluoride hydrophobic membranes. BERTopic discovered 62 local concepts. The most researched local topics were solar applications, membrane scaling, and electrospun membranes, while the least investigated were boron removal, dairy effluent applications, and nickel wastewater treatment. In addition, the topics were illustrated in a 2D plane to better understand the obtained results.

AB  - In the current digital era, the field of education is undergoing unprecedented changes. Artificial Intelligence (AI), as a revolutionary technology, has demonstrated its unique advantages in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. To explore the application of AI in education and teaching, as well as its evolving trends, we analyzed 1364 CSSCI papers from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database from 2014 to 2023. Employing bibliometrics and knowledge mapping methods, we established a detailed view of the development trends and research hotspots in AI-driven education and teaching research. The Citespace software was employed for visual analysis of critical data such as authors, institutions, and keywords, including the collaboration networks of authors and institutions, keyword frequency and centrality, and the evolution of research topics. Our analysis revealed that AI-driven education and teaching research from 2014 to 2023 can be divided into three developmental stages: nascent (2014–2016), rapid development (2017–2019), and stable development (2020–2023). What's more, we identified close cooperation among core institutions and authors, determined multiple hotspot topics in AI within education and teaching, and revealed the developmental trajectory of these topics.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic presented a challenge to the global research community as scientists rushed to find solutions to the devastating crisis. Drawing expectations from resilience theory, this paper explores how the trajectory of and research community around the coronavirus research was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Characterizing epistemic clusters and pathways of knowledge through extracting terms featured in articles in early COVID-19 research, combined with evolutionary pathways and statistical analysis, the results reveal that the pandemic disrupted existing lines of coronavirus research to a large degree. While some communities of coronavirus research are similar pre- and during COVID-19, topics themselves change significantly and there is less cohesion amongst early COVID-19 research compared to that before the pandemic. We find that some lines of research revert to basic research pursued almost a decade earlier, whilst others pursue brand new trajectories. The epidemiology topic is the most resilient among the many subjects related to COVID-19 research. Chinese researchers in particular appear to be driving more novel research approaches in the early months of the pandemic. The findings raise questions about whether shifts are advantageous for global scientific progress, and whether the research community will return to the original equilibrium or reorganize into a different knowledge configuration.

AB  - As a global medical problem, tinnitus can seriously harm human health and is difficult to alleviate, ranking among the top 3 complex diseases in the otolaryngology field. Traditional cognitive behavioral therapy and sound therapy require offline face-to-face treatment with medical staff and have limited effectiveness. Mobile health (mHealth), which, in recent decades, has been greatly applied in the field of rehabilitation health care, improving access to health care resources and the quality of services, has potential research value in the adjunctive treatment of tinnitus.This study aimed to understand the research trends, product characteristics, problems, and research transformation of tinnitus treatment software by analyzing the research progress of mHealth for tinnitus treatment based on the literature and related marketed apps.Bibliometric methods were used to describe the characteristics of the relevant literature in terms of the number and topics of publications, authors, and institutions. We further compared the features and limitations of the currently available tinnitus treatment software.Data published until February 28, 2022, were collected. Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) standardized screening process, 75 papers were included. The country with the highest number of publications was Germany, followed by the United Kingdom and the United States, whereas China had only a single relevant study. The most frequently found journals were the American Journal of Audiology and the Journal of the American Academy of Audiology (18/75, 24%). With regard to publication topics, cognitive behavioral therapy started to become a hot topic in 2017, and research on mHealth apps has increased. In this study, 28 tinnitus treatment apps were obtained (n=24, 86% from product data and n=4, 14% from literature data); these apps were developed mainly in the United States (10/28, 36%) or China (9/28, 32%). The main treatment methods were sound therapy (10/28, 36%) and cognitive behavioral therapy (2/28, 7%). Of the 75 publications, 7 (9%) described apps in the market stage. Of the 28 apps, 22 (79%) lacked literature studies or evidence from professional bodies.We found that, as a whole, the use of mHealth for treatment and intervention in tinnitus was showing a rapid development, in which good progress had been made in studies around sound therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy, although most of the studies (50/75, 67%) focused on treatment effects. However, the field is poorly accepted in top medical journals, and the majority are in the research design phase, with a lack of translation of the literature results and clinical validation of the marketed apps. Furthermore, in the future, novel artificial intelligence techniques should be used to address the issue of staged monitoring of tinnitus.

AB  - With the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown, social media became a vital communication tool. The sudden outburst of online activity influenced information spread and consumption patterns. It increases the relevance of studying the dynamics of social networks and developing data processing pipelines that allow a comprehensive analysis of social media data in the temporal dimension. This paper scopes the weekly dynamics of the information space represented by Russian social media (Twitter and LiveJournal) during a critical period (massive COVID-19 outbreak and first governmental measures). The approach is twofold: 1) build the time series of topic similarity indicators by identifying COVID-related topics in each week and measuring user contribution to the topic space, and 2) cluster user activity and display user-topic relationships on graphs in a dashboard application. The paper describes the development of the pipeline, explains the choices made and provides a case study of the adaptation to virus control measures. The results confirm that social processes and behavior in response to pandemic-triggered changes can be successfully traced in social media. Moreover, the adaptation trends revealed by psychological and sociological studies are reflected in our data and can be explored using the proposed method.

AB  - This article reviewed the state-of-the-art applications of the Internet of things (IoT) technology applied in homes for making them smart, automated, and digitalized in many respects. The literature presented various applications, systems, or methods and reported the results of using IoT, artificial intelligence (AI), and geographic information system (GIS) at homes. Because the technology has been advancing and users are experiencing IoT boom for smart built environment applications, especially smart homes and smart energy systems, it is necessary to identify the gaps, relation between current methods, and provide a coherent instruction of the whole process of designing smart homes. This article reviewed relevant papers within databases, such as Scopus, including journal papers published in between 2010 and 2019. These papers were then analyzed in terms of bibliography and content to identify more related systems, practices, and contributors. A designed systematic review method was used to identify and select the relevant papers, which were then reviewed for their content by means of coding. The presented systematic critical review focuses on systems developed and technologies used for smart homes. The main question is ”What has been learned from a decade trailing smart system developments in different fields?”. We found that there is a considerable gap in the integration of AI and IoT and the use of geospatial data in smart home development. It was also found that there is a large gap in the literature in terms of limited integrated systems for energy efficiency and aged care system development. This article would enable researchers and professionals to fully understand those gaps in IoT-based environments and suggest ways to fill the gaps while designing smart homes where users have a higher level of thermal comfort while saving energy and greenhouse gas emissions. This article also raised new challenging questions on how IoT and existing developed systems could be improved and be further developed to address other issues of energy saving, which can steer the research direction to full smart systems. This would significantly help to design fully automated assistive systems to improve quality of life and decrease energy consumption.

AB  - Over the past three decades, there have been many comprehensive studies related to public–private partnerships (PPP), but the analysis at the macro level still lacks comprehensiveness and interpretability. Through the application of bibliometric analysis, 2-mode network, and strategic coordinate analysis, we systematically analyzed the derivative characteristics of the literature data and the coupling characteristics of countries and keywords. Moreover, through the frequency and betweenness centrality, etc., this paper determines the evolution path of keywords and the evolution direction of theme words and realizes the prediction of theme words and keywords in the future. The results show that: (1) Through the three-stage biclustering analysis, we determined the hot theme words and hot keywords for each stage and focused the theme direction and main research content of the evolution, which led to great interpretability of the data analysis in the literature characteristics; (2) Through the distribution characteristics of time and space, the USA, China, the UK and other mainstream publishing countries and their main research hotspots were determined. Among them, developing countries have strong willingness in academic cooperation and great potential for academic development; (3) According to the derivative characteristics of the literature data, it is predicted that the future research hotspots are: the integration of business economy and sustainability, the integration of policy support and innovative technology application, and the urbanization promotion of developing countries. Based on the findings, this study makes concrete and targeted research methods and provides reference value and application value for the future research and analysis of PPP.

AB  - Abstract The annual number of publications at scientific venues, for example, conferences and journals, is growing quickly. Hence, even for researchers it becomes harder and harder to keep track of research topics and their progress. In this task, researchers can be supported by automated publication analysis. Yet, many such methods result in uninterpretable, purely numerical representations. As an attempt to support human analysts, we present topic space trajectories , a structure that allows for the comprehensible tracking of research topics. We demonstrate how these trajectories can be interpreted based on eight different analysis approaches. To obtain comprehensible results, we employ non-negative matrix factorization as well as suitable visualization techniques. We show the applicability of our approach on a publication corpus spanning 50 years of machine learning research from 32 publication venues. In addition to a thorough introduction of our method, our focus is on an extensive analysis of the results we achieved. Our novel analysis method may be employed for paper classification, for the prediction of future research topics, and for the recommendation of fitting conferences and journals for submitting unpublished work. An advantage in these applications over previous methods lies in the good interpretability of the results obtained through our methods.

AB  - The OMG standard Systems Modeling Language (SysML) has been on the market for about thirteen years. This standard is an extended subset of UML providing a graphical modeling language for designing complex systems by considering software as well as hardware parts. Over the period of thirteen years, many publications have covered various aspects of SysML in different research fields. The aim of this paper is to conduct a systematic mapping study about SysML to identify the different categories of papers, (i) to get an overview of existing research topics and groups, (ii) to identify whether there are any publication trends, and (iii) to uncover possible missing links. We followed the guidelines for conducting a systematic mapping study by Petersen et al. (Inf Softw Technol 64:1–18, 2015) to analyze SysML publications from 2005 to 2017. Our analysis revealed the following main findings: (i) there is a growing scientific interest in SysML in the last years particularly in the research field of Software Engineering, (ii) SysML is mostly used in the design or validation phase, rather than in the implementation phase, (iii) the most commonly used diagram types are the SysML-specific requirement diagram, parametric diagram, and block diagram, together with the activity diagram and state machine diagram known from UML, (iv) SysML is a specific UML profile mostly used in systems engineering; however, the language has to be customized to accommodate domain-specific aspects, (v) related to collaborations for SysML research over the world, there are more individual research groups than large international networks. This study provides a solid basis for classifying existing approaches for SysML. Researchers can use our results (i) for identifying open research issues, (ii) for a better understanding of the state of the art, and (iii) as a reference for finding specific approaches about SysML.

AB  - Abstract Firms with the assets complementary to Artificial Intelligence (AI) have actively conducted AI research and selectively published their results since AI has resurged around 2006. Focusing on the recent AI development, we investigate how and to what extent firms’ deep engagement in the publication of emerging science-related technology can influence the evolution of published knowledge. Using bibliometric analyses applied to the papers in major AI conferences and journals, we find that papers with at least one author affiliated to a firm, and particularly papers with only firm-affiliated author(s), have had higher influence on the formation of published knowledge trajectory than other papers. In addition, papers from firm and non-firm (university and public research institution) collaborations show higher novelty and conventionality than other papers. These findings deepen our understanding of the role of firms in the evolution of emerging science-related technology.

AB  - To provide direction and advice for future research on Industry 4.0 maintenance, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of 344 eligible journal papers published between 2013 and 2022. Our systematic literature review identifies key trends in advanced maintenance techniques and the consolidation of traditional maintenance concepts, which are driven by the increasing adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies and the need to optimize manufacturing systems' performance and reliability. In light of our findings, we highlight the importance of addressing sustainability factors, human aspects, and the implementation of environmental KPIs in future research. Building upon these insights, we introduce the Maintenance 5.0 framework, which emphasizes the integration of human-centered and AI-driven strategies for achieving efficient and sustainable maintenance in Zero-Defect Manufacturing (ZDM) systems. We propose a novel framework that links traditional and advanced maintenance policies for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to facilitate the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies in the maintenance field. This work underscores the need for future research to bridge the gap between these policies, enabling a seamless transition for SMEs towards Industry 4.0 maintenance practices, while fostering sustainable and socially responsible operations.

AB  - Growing interest is awarded to the digitalization of the building permitting use case and many works are developed about the topic. However, the subject is very complex and many aspects are usually tackled separately, making it very hard for traditional literature reviews to grasp the actual progress in the overall topic. This paper unveils the detailed state of the art in Digital Building Permitting (DBP) by critically analysing the literature by means of a set of coding tags (research progress, implementation, affected DBP workflow steps, ambitions addressed) assigned by a multidisciplinary team. The executed research shows that the mainly addressed aspects of the digitalization of building permit process are the technologies to check the compliance of design proposals against regulations, followed by the digitalization of regulations. Improvable aspects identified in the entire building permit system are instead e.g. the involvement of officers, scalability of solutions and interoperability of data, intended both as data validation and as integration of geospatial data with building models.

AB  - Charities investing on rare disease research greatly contribute to generate ground-breaking knowledge with the clear goal of finding a cure for their condition of interest. Although the amount of their investments may be relatively small compared to major funders, the advocacy groups' clear mission promotes innovative research and aggregates highly motivated and mission-oriented scientists. Here, we illustrate the case of Fondazione italiana di ricerca per la Sclerosi Laterale Amiotrofica (AriSLA), the main Italian funding agency entirely dedicated to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis research. An international benchmark analysis of publications derived from AriSLA-funded projects indicated that their mean relative citation ratio values (iCite dashboard, National Institutes of Health, U.S.) were very high, suggesting a strong influence on the referring international scientific community. An interesting trend of research toward translation based on the "triangle of biomedicine" and paper citations (iCite) was also observed. Qualitative analysis on researchers' accomplishments was convergent with the bibliometric data, indicating a high level of performance of several working groups, lines of research that speak of progression toward clinical translation, and one study that has progressed from the investigation of cellular mechanisms to a Phase 2 international clinical trial. The key elements of the success of the AriSLA investment lie in: (i) the clear definition of the objectives (research with potential impact on patients, no matter how far), (ii) a rigorous peer-review process entrusted to an international panel of experts, (iii) diversification of the portfolio with ad hoc selection criteria, which also contributed to bringing new experts and younger scientists to the field, and (iv) a close interaction of AriSLA stakeholders with scientists, who developed a strong sense of belonging. Periodic review of the portfolio of investments is a vital practice for funding agencies. Sharing information between funding agencies about their own policies and research assessment methods and outcomes help guide the international debate on funding strategies and research directions to be undertaken, particularly in the field of rare diseases, where synergy is a relevant enabling factor.

AB  - The advent of a new generation of wireless communications has punctuated the dawn of every decade in recent times. Upgrades to mobile electronic systems represent faster and more robust capabilities of data transfer but bring with it a wide set of complementary changes as they are underpinned by harmonised specific spectrum bands, fresh international technical standards, new network operation requirements, innovative cellular devices as well as new services and a broader array of potential commercial use applications. This paper presents a systematic outline of the development of 5G-related research until 2020 as revealed by over 10,000 science and technology publications. The exercise addresses the emergence, growth, and impact of this body of work and offers insights regarding disciplinary distribution, international performance, and historical dynamics. Findings reveal the progressive growth of the 5G research over the years after original contributions in 2010 and point to a "take-off" around 2014. A set of stylised facts regarding this technology since its infancy are of interest to engineers, regulators and innovation strategists and policy-makers.

AB  - In the response surface methodology (RSM), the designed experiment helps create interfactor orthogonality and interpretable response models for the purpose of process and design optimization. However, along with the development of data-recording technology, observational data have emerged as an alternative to experimental data, and they contain potential information on design/process parameters (as factors) and product characteristics that are useful for RSM analysis. Recent studies in various fields have proposed modifications to the standard RSM procedures to adopt observational data and attain considerable results despite some limitations. This paper aims to explore various methods to incorporate observational data in the RSM through a systematic literature review. More than 400 papers were retrieved from the Scopus database, and 83 were selected and carefully reviewed. To adopt observational data, modifications to the procedures of RSM analysis include the design of the experiment (DoE), response modeling, and design/process optimization. The proposed approaches were then mapped to capture the sequence of the modified RSM analysis. The findings highlight the novelty of observational-data-based RSM (RSM-OD) for generating reproducible results involving the discussion of the treatments for observational data as an alternative to the DoE, the refinement of the RSM model to fit the data, and the adaptation of the optimization technique. Future potential research, such as the improvement of factor orthogonality and RSM model modifications, is also discussed.

AB  - The design of recommendation algorithms aware of the user’s context has been the subject of great interest in the scientific community, especially in the music domain where contextual factors have a significant impact on the recommendations. In this type of system, the user’s contextual information can come from different sources such as the specific time of day, the user’s physical activity, and geolocation, among many others. This context information is generally obtained by electronic devices used by the user to listen to music such as smartphones and other secondary devices such as wearables and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The objective of this paper is to present a systematic literature review to analyze recent work to date in the field of context-aware recommender systems and specifically in the domain of music recommendation. This paper aims to analyze and classify the type of contextual information, the electronic devices used to collect it, the main outstanding challenges and the possible opportunities for future research directions.

AB  - Recommender systems have significantly developed in recent years in parallel with the witnessed advancements in both internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Accordingly, as a consequence of IoT and AI, multiple forms of data are incorporated in these systems, e.g. social, implicit, local and personal information, which can help in improving recommender systems’ performance and widen their applicability to traverse different disciplines. On the other side, energy efficiency in the building sector is becoming a hot research topic, in which recommender systems play a major role by promoting energy saving behavior and reducing carbon emissions. However, the deployment of the recommendation frameworks in buildings still needs more investigations to identify the current challenges and issues, where their solutions are the keys to enable the pervasiveness of research findings, and therefore, ensure a large-scale adoption of this technology. Accordingly, this paper presents, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the first timely and comprehensive reference for energy-efficiency recommendation systems through (i) surveying existing recommender systems for energy saving in buildings; (ii) discussing their evolution; (iii) providing an original taxonomy of these systems based on specified criteria, including the nature of the recommender engine, its objective, computing platforms, evaluation metrics and incentive measures; and (iv) conducting an in-depth, critical analysis to identify their limitations and unsolved issues. The derived challenges and areas of future implementation could effectively guide the energy research community to improve the energy-efficiency in buildings and reduce the cost of developed recommender systems-based solutions.

AB  - Failures are unavoidable in communication networks, so their detection and identification are vital for the reliable operation of the networks. The existing fault diagnosis techniques are based on many paradigms derived from different areas (e.g., mathematical theories, machine learning, statistical analysis) and with different purposes, such as, obtaining a representation model of the network for fault localization, selecting optimal probe sets for monitoring network devices, reducing fault detection time, and detection of faulty components in the network. Nevertheless, there are still challenges to be faced because those techniques are invasive on account of they increase network traffic and the control overhead. Also, they intensify the internal processes of the network through expanding management processes or monitoring agents on almost all networking devices. This paper introduces a non-invasive fault detection approach based on the observation of symptoms of internal network failures in gateway routers (called peripheral elements). We developed a link failure induction experiment in an emulated network that evidenced the existence of the fault propagation phenomenon to a peripheral level, which demonstrates the feasibility of our approach. Our results foster the use of learning techniques which do not require a complete dependency model of the network and could continuously diagnose the failure symptoms while being resilient to the dynamic changes of the network.

AB  - Τhe large amounts of information produced daily by organizations and enterprises have led to the development of specialized software that can process high volumes of data. Given that the technologies and methodologies used to develop software are constantly changing, offering significant market opportunities, organizations turn to patenting their inventions to secure their ownership as well as their commercial exploitation. In this study, we investigate the landscape of data-oriented software development via the collection and analysis of information extracted from patents. To this regard, we made use of advanced statistical and machine learning approaches, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Brokerage Analysis for the identification of technological trends and thematic axes related to software development patent activity dedicated to data processing and data management processes. Our findings reveal that high-profile countries and organizations are engaging in patent granting, while the main thematic circles found in the retrieved patent data revolve around data updates, integration, version control and software deployment. The results indicate that patent grants in this technological domain are expected to continue their increasing trend in the following years, given that technologies evolve and the need for efficient data processing becomes even more present.

AB  - In today’s world, artificial intelligence (AI) and human intelligence coexist, and no field is free from the impact of AI. At present, education cannot be discussed without mentioning AI, which has an omnidirectional impact on all its areas, including the purpose, content, method, and evaluation system. This study aimed to explore the future direction of education by examining the current impact and predicting future impacts of AI. It also examined research trends and collaboration status by country through network analysis, topic modeling and global research trends in AI in education (AIED), by applying the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm. Over the past 20 years, the number of papers on AIED has steadily increased, with a dramatic rise since 2015. The research can be broadly classified into eight topics, including “changes in the content of teaching and learning.” Using a linear regression model, three hot topics, two cold topics and trend changes for each research topic were identified. The study found that AIED research should be more thematically diversified and in-depth; this directly applies AI algorithms and technologies to education, which should be further promoted. This study provides a reference for exploring the direction of future AIED research.

AB  - Systematic Review (SR) presents the highest form of evidence in research for decision and policy-making. Nonetheless, the structured steps involved in carrying out SRs make it demanding for reviewers. Many studies have projected the abstract screening stage in the SR process to be the most burdensome for reviewers, thus automating this stage with artificial intelligence (AI). However, majority of these studies focus on using traditional machine learning classifiers for the abstract classification. Thus, there remain a gap to explore the potential of deep learning techniques for this task. This study seeks to bridge the gap by exploring how LSTM and Bi-LSTM models together with GloVe for vectorisation can accelerate this stage. As a further aim to increase precision while sustaining a recall >= 95% due to precision-recall trade-off, attention mechanics is added to these classifiers. The final experimental results obtained showed that Bi-LSTM with attention has the capacity to expedite citation screening.

AB  - Against the backdrop of the expanding debate on smart cities, the objective of this paper is to examine to what extent and to what end the connection between smart services and smart cities has been explored in the literature, and what to make of it. It is argued that smart services, including demand- and innovation-driven service development, constitute an essential part of the broad concept of smart city. Viewed in this way, smart services serve as one of the key levers through which smart cities grow, develop, and build their resilience. By placing the analysis in the broader context of the smart city as smart service system, this paper sheds light on the still underexplored fields of research and suggests how they could be examined. For the purpose of the analysis, the Science Mapping (SciMat) method is employed as it allows to quantify and to visualize research output featured in Scopus and Web of Science (WoS), thus aiding the analysis. The added value of this paper is two-fold, i.e., (i) the SciMat analysis identifies the key dimensions of the nascent smart services in smart cities debate, and consequently, (ii) allows for suggesting topics that should be further investigated to detect the drivers for cities’ growth, resilience, and sustainability.

AB  - Introduction This study explores the effects of Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots, with a particular focus on OpenAI’s ChatGPT, on Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). With the rapid advancement of AI, understanding its implications in the educational sector becomes paramount. Methods Utilizing databases like PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar, we systematically searched for literature on AI chatbots’ impact on HEIs. Our criteria prioritized peer-reviewed articles, prominent media outlets, and English publications, excluding tangential AI chatbot mentions. After selection, data extraction focused on authors, study design, and primary findings. The analysis combined descriptive and thematic approaches, emphasizing patterns and applications of AI chatbots in HEIs. Results The literature review revealed diverse perspectives on ChatGPT’s potential in education. Notable benefits include research support, automated grading, and enhanced human-computer interaction. However, concerns such as online testing security, plagiarism, and broader societal and economic impacts like job displacement, the digital literacy gap, and AI-induced anxiety were identified. The study also underscored the transformative architecture of ChatGPT and its versatile applications in the educational sector. Furthermore, potential advantages like streamlined enrollment, improved student services, teaching enhancements, research aid, and increased student retention were highlighted. Conversely, risks such as privacy breaches, misuse, bias, misinformation, decreased human interaction, and accessibility issues were identified. Discussion While AI’s global expansion is undeniable, there is a pressing need for balanced regulation in its application within HEIs. Faculty members are encouraged to utilize AI tools like ChatGPT proactively and ethically to mitigate risks, especially academic fraud. Despite the study’s limitations, including an incomplete representation of AI’s overall effect on education and the absence of concrete integration guidelines, it is evident that AI technologies like ChatGPT present both significant benefits and risks. The study advocates for a thoughtful and responsible integration of such technologies within HEIs.

AB  - Forest ecological products are closely related to ecological balance, and an in-depth understanding of the development dynamics of these products is crucial to the realization of sustainable development that integrates ecological, economic, and social benefits. Based on the Web of Science (WOS) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases, this study conducted a comprehensive econometric analysis of the number of articles, journals, research institutions, author collaborations, research hotspots, and research trends of forest ecological products globally during the period of 2003–2023 with the help of CiteSpace software (Philadelphia, PA, USA). The study’s results revealed the following insights: (1) The research on forest ecological products in recent years showed a general upward trend, but the research interest in foreign countries was higher than that in China. (2) The literature within the WOS database primarily focused on the field of ecology, whereas the literature in the CNKI database predominantly emphasized the field of forestry. (3) In both databases, the Chinese Academy of Sciences was the organization with the highest number of articles. Globally, Chinese institutions had the largest proportion of articles issued. The high percentage of articles issued by specialized agricultural and forestry schools in China showed clear domain relevance. (4) In both databases, author collaborations were relatively decentralized, and no significant core group of authors had been formed. (5) The research hotspots in foreign countries focused on the ecological regulation of forest ecological products, while the research hotspots in China focused on the realization of the economic value of forest ecological products. (6) “Machine learning”, “river basin”, and “health” are the future research frontiers in foreign countries, while “ecological function” and “forest ecosystem service” are the future research frontiers in China. The results of both databases indicate that the sustainability of forest ecological products is a research trend for the coming period. Finally, the outlook for future research on forest eco-products is presented in four aspects: promoting the establishment of a unified international standard certification system for forest eco-products, developing diversified products, strengthening the function of policy support and guidance, and establishing national partnerships.

AB  - The article substantiates the existence of convergence processes in the field of digitization of countries, taking into account the number of Internet users; people with advanced skills; and indicators of infrastructure (network coverage, population covered by at least a 3G mobile network, population covered by at least a 4G mobile network), access (access to ICT at home, active mobile broadband subscriptions, fixed broadband subscriptions), enablers (fixed broadband over 10 Mbps, mobile data and voice basket, high consumption) and barriers (improved broadband access from 256 kbps to 2 Mbps and from 2 Mbps to 10 Mbps mobile data and voice basket, low consumption) of digital development. The methodological basis for determining the sigma convergence of digitization processes is the coefficient of variation. The values of the coefficient of variation confirmed the high level of convergence between the studied countries in terms of the degree of use of the Internet for conducting digital transactions. The developed econometric model, which describes the influence of statistically significant integral indicators of the national cybersecurity level, ease of doing business, and the anti-money laundering index on the country's digital development level, made it possible to determine the average trend of dependence on the level of digital development. One hundred four countries were considered for the analysis. The conducted study of the impact of digitalization on economic transformations based on developed quantile regressions made it possible to analyze exactly how the level of digital development for countries with a high level of digitalization and for countries with a low level of digitalization development depends on the value of the national cybersecurity indicator and the ease of doing business, and which countries have the least resistance to the risk factors of their involvement in fraudulent schemes for the purpose of legalizing criminal income.

AB  - Citation recommendation describes the task of recommending citations for a given text. Due to the overload of published scientific works in recent years on the one hand, and the need to cite the most appropriate publications when writing scientific texts on the other hand, citation recommendation has emerged as an important research topic. In recent years, several approaches and evaluation data sets have been presented. However, to the best of our knowledge, no literature survey has been conducted explicitly on citation recommendation. In this article, we give a thorough introduction into automatic citation recommendation research. We then present an overview of the approaches and data sets for citation recommendation and identify differences and commonalities using various dimensions. Last but not least, we shed light on the evaluation methods, and outline general challenges in the evaluation and how to meet them. We restrict ourselves to citation recommendation for scientific publications, as this document type has been studied the most in this area. However, many of the observations and discussions included in this survey are also applicable to other types of text, such as news articles and encyclopedic articles.

AB  - The recent tailings storage facility (TSF) dam failures recorded around the world have concerned society in general, forcing the mining industry to improve its operating standards, invest greater economic resources, and implement the best available technologies (BATs) to control TSFs for safety purposes and avoid spills, accidents, and collapses. In this context, and as the era of digitalization and Industry 4.0 continues, monitoring technologies based on sensors have become increasingly common in the mining industry. This article studies the state of the art of implementing sensor technologies to monitor structural health and safety management issues in TSFs, highlighting advances and experiences through a review of the scientific literature on the topic. The methodology applied in this article adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and utilizes scientific maps for data visualization. To do so, three steps were implemented: (i) a quantitative bibliometric analysis, (ii) a qualitative systematic review of the literature, and (iii) a mixed review to integrate the findings from (i) and (ii). As a result, this article presents the main advances, gaps, and future trends regarding the main characteristics of the sensor technologies applied to monitor TSF structural health and safety management in the era of digitalization. According to the results, the existing research predominantly investigates certain TSF sensor technologies, such as wireless real-time monitoring, remote sensors (RS), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), unmanned survey vessels (USVs), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing (CC), and Internet of Things (IoT) approaches, among others. These technologies stand out for their potential to improve the safety management monitoring of mine tailings, which is particularly significant in the context of climate change-related hazards, and to reduce the risk of TSF failures. They are recognized as emerging smart mining solutions with reliable, simple, scalable, secure, and competitive characteristics.

AB  - Research has indicated strong relationships between learners’ affect and their learning. Emotions relate closely to students’ well-being, learning quality, productivity, and interaction. Digital game-based learning (DGBL) has been widely recognized to be effective in enhancing learning experiences and increasing student motivation. The field of emotions in DGBL has become an active research field with accumulated literature available, which calls for a comprehensive understanding of the up-to-date literature concerning emotions in virtual DGBL among students at all educational levels. Based on 393 research articles collected from the Web of Science, this study, for the first time, explores the current advances and topics in this field. Specifically, thematic evolution analysis is conducted to explore the evolution of topics that are categorized into four different groups (i.e., games, emotions, applications, and analytical technologies) in the corpus. Social network analysis explores the co-occurrences between topics to identify their relationships. Interesting results are obtained. For example, with the integration of diverse applications (e.g., mobiles) and analytical technologies (e.g., learning analytics and affective computing), increasing types of affective states, socio-emotional factors, and digital games are investigated. Additionally, implications for future research include 1) children’s anxiety/attitude and engagement in collaborative gameplay, 2) individual personalities and characteristics for personalized support, 3) emotion dynamics, 4) multimodal data use, 5) game customization, 6) balance between learners’ skill levels and game challenge as well as rewards and learning anxiety.

AB  - Abstract ChatGPT and its variants that use generative artificial intelligence (AI) models have rapidly become a focal point in academic and media discussions about their potential benefits and drawbacks across various sectors of the economy, democracy, society, and environment. It remains unclear whether these technologies result in job displacement or creation, or if they merely shift human labour by generating new, potentially trivial or practically irrelevant, information and decisions. According to the CEO of ChatGPT, the potential impact of this new family of AI technology could be as big as “the printing press”, with significant implications for employment, stakeholder relationships, business models, and academic research, and its full consequences are largely undiscovered and uncertain. The introduction of more advanced and potent generative AI tools in the AI market, following the launch of ChatGPT, has ramped up the “AI arms race”, creating continuing uncertainty for workers, expanding their business applications, while heightening risks related to well‐being, bias, misinformation, context insensitivity, privacy issues, ethical dilemmas, and security. Given these developments, this perspectives editorial offers a collection of perspectives and research pathways to extend HRM scholarship in the realm of generative AI. In doing so, the discussion synthesizes the literature on AI and generative AI, connecting it to various aspects of HRM processes, practices, relationships, and outcomes, thereby contributing to shaping the future of HRM research.

AB  - Today, one can observe shifts in the research landscape, which is formed by digitization and open science principles. The open science movement continues to gain momentum, attention and debate. In parallel with the principle of unity, open science gives rise to a taxonomy of several related ideas, guidelines and concepts, such as open access, open replicable research and open data. Over the past fifteen years, research institutions have focused on open access to publications. However, recently the focus of attention has shifted to research data as a “new currency” in research activities and their distribution in open access, and the guiding principles of data management are becoming crucial for the wide implementation of open science practices and the effective use of data in research, industry, business and other sectors of the economy. In this context, it is relevant to carry out a thorough study of primary scientific works on open science issues and to study the role of the concept of “open research data” in the paradigm of a holistic ecosystem of open science and business ecosystem. In this work, it is proposed to use the methods of quantitative and qualitative bibliometric analysis, which allows to identify the main trends and form the basis for further research. The information base for this work was the international scientometric database Scopus, which enables to analyze bibliographic data using built-in tools and import them for external use in the VOSviewer software. The study revealed an increasing trend in the number of publications on the subject under study, with the highest annual growth rate in 2017 (76%) and 2019 (66%). Qualitative bibliographic analysis made it possible to analyze the most cited and, therefore, trending works on the selected topic. In terms of the number of citations per year, the results show that the studies with such directions in open science as open program code (open source); data/research reproducibility, research data management; open access to publications (open access) are most popular. In addition, a cluster analysis of the co-prevalence of keywords was conducted. It formed clusters dedicated to both institutional and infrastructural problems of the development of open science and research data. Separately, the results of the analysis create a scientific basis for further research into the key determinants of the effectiveness of the implementation of a proper research data management system at the micro, meso, and macro levels. It will improve the effectiveness of the implementation of scientific developments from one field of knowledge to another, while achieving increased interdisciplinary research. In parallel with this, interested persons of the real sector of the economy get the opportunity to analyze scientific results, determining the possibility of their adoption in their own activities.

AB  - Anomaly detection is one of the most active research areas in various critical domains, such as healthcare, fintech, and public security. However, little attention has been paid to scholarly data, that is, anomaly detection in a citation network. Citation is considered as one of the most crucial metrics to evaluate the impact of scientific research, which may be gamed in multiple ways. Therefore, anomaly detection in citation networks is of significant importance to identify manipulation and inflation of citations. To address this open issue, we propose a novel deep graph learning model, namely graph learning for anomaly detection (GLAD), to identify anomalies in citation networks. GLAD incorporates text semantic mining to network representation learning by adding both node attributes and link attributes via graph neural networks (GNNs). It exploits not only the relevance of citation contents, but also hidden relationships between papers. Within the GLAD framework, we propose an algorithm called Citation PUrpose (CPU) to discover the purpose of citation based on citation context. The performance of GLAD is validated through a simulated anomalous citation dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of GLAD on the anomalous citation detection task.

AB  - Objective of the study: this editorial aims to present an overview of Brazilian quantitative research in entrepreneurship, as well as describing possibilities for advancing this methodological approach. Methodology and approach: the article consists of an editorial publication, built from bibliographic research of entrepreneurship literature and theoretical reflections. Main Results: Most national entrepreneurship research follows a qualitative approach. Despite its relevance, quantitative research also has multiple potentialities, especially associated with the use of data originating from secondary sources. Main theoretical and methodological contributions: We present public databases that can be used by entrepreneurship researchers to advance theory. Some strategies for using these bases are exemplified through a brief tutorial in R language. We further debate about strategies to strengthen quantitative research in the area. Finally, we bring a research agenda. Relevance/Originality: contents that are still little explored in the national literature are presented, such as the use of secondary data and machine learning. Social and managerial contributions: some of the databases presented in the study come from government sources and can be used to support the construction of public policies for entrepreneurship. In addition, the precepts on quantitative research presented in this editorial can support managers who work with data analysis to perform more robust studies, regardless of the area, whether practical or academic.

AB  - Construction 4.0 is witnessing exponential growth in digital twin (DT) technology developments and applications, revolutionizing the adoption of building information modelling (BIM) and other emerging technologies used throughout the built environment lifecycle. BIM provides technologies, procedures, and data schemas representing building components and systems. At the same time, the DT enhances this with real-time data for integrating cyber-physical systems, enabling live asset monitoring and better decision making. Despite being in the early stages of development, DT applications have rapidly progressed in the AEC sector, resulting in a diverse literature landscape due to the various technologies and parameters involved in fully developing the DT technology. The intricate complexities inherent in digital twin advancements have confused professionals and researchers. This confusion arises from the nuanced distinctions between the two technologies, i.e., BIM and DT, causing a convergence that hinders realizing their potential. To address this confusion and lead to a swift development of DT technology, this study provides a holistic review of the existing research focusing on the critical components responsible for developing the applications of DT technology in the construction industry. It highlights five crucial elements: technologies, maturity levels, data layers, enablers, and functionalities. Additionally, it identifies research gaps and proposes future avenues for streamlined DT developments and applications in the AEC sector. Future researchers and practitioners can target data integrity, integration and transmission, bi-directional interoperability, non-technical factors, and data security to achieve mature digital twin applications for AEC practices. This study highlights the growing significance of DTs in construction and provides a foundation for further advancements in this field to harness its potential to transform built environment practices. It also pinpoints the latest developments in AI, namely the large language model (LLM) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)’s implications for DT education, policies, and the construction industry’s practices.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are central components of today's medical environment. The fairness of AI, i.e. the ability of AI to be free from bias, has repeatedly come into question. This study investigates the diversity of members of academia whose scholarship poses questions about the fairness of AI. The articles that combine the topics of fairness, artificial intelligence, and medicine were selected from Pubmed, Google Scholar, and Embase using keywords. Eligibility and data extraction from the articles were done manually and cross-checked by another author for accuracy. Articles were selected for further analysis, cleaned, and organized in Microsoft Excel; spatial diagrams were generated using Public Tableau. Additional graphs were generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Linear and logistic regressions were conducted using Python to measure the relationship between funding status, number of citations, and the gender demographics of the authorship team. We identified 375 eligible publications, including research and review articles concerning AI and fairness in healthcare. Analysis of the bibliographic data revealed that there is an overrepresentation of authors that are white, male, and are from high-income countries, especially in the roles of first and last author. Additionally, analysis showed that papers whose authors are based in higher-income countries were more likely to be cited more often and published in higher impact journals. These findings highlight the lack of diversity among the authors in the AI fairness community whose work gains the largest readership, potentially compromising the very impartiality that the AI fairness community is working towards.

AB  - This study provides a systematic review of the literature on innovation research (IR) over the past two decades. We used data-driven approaches integrating network and natural language processing techniques on 41 innovation core and ancillary journals to characterize the IR landscape. Contrary to previous efforts, we explored knowledge in the whole IR field from general and specific patterns of growth and interaction using cluster-and term-based data and macro-and micro-level perspectives, respectively. Our results helped us uncover the changing features of the IR landscape in recent years: (i) a strong move into social-and sustainability-driven innovation; (ii) the merging of products and services into business model innovation; (iii) the more influential role of stakeholders such as the government and the general public; (iv) the use of global analytical perspectives while considering local contexts; (v) the importance of greater visions “pulling” innovation; (vi) the greater role of “soft” issues such as behaviors; and (vi) a shift into sectoral, geographical, and methodological diversification. Building on these aspects, we developed an emerging model for future innovation research and a series of IR propositions. Our findings help generate opportunities to build future innovation capabilities in research, practice, and education.

AB  - Smart cities are rapidly evolving concept-transforming urban developments in the 21st century. Smart cities use advanced technologies and data analytics to improve the quality of life for their citizens, increase the efficiency of infrastructure and services, and promote sustainable economic growth. Smart cities integrate multiple domains, including transportation, energy, health, education, and governance, to create an interconnected and intelligent urban environment. Our research study methodology was a structured literature review using Web of Science and Google Scholar and ten smart city research questions. The research questions included smart city definitions, advantages, disadvantages, implementation challenges, funding, types of applications, quantitative techniques for analysis, and prioritization metrics. In addition, our study analyzes the implementation of smart city solutions in international contexts and proposes strategies to overcome implementation challenges. The integration of technology and data-driven solutions in smart cities has the potential to revolutionize urban living by providing citizens with personalized and accessible services. However, the implementation also presents challenges, including data privacy concerns, unequal access to technology, and the need for collaboration across private, public, and government sectors. This study provides insights into the current state and future prospects of smart cities and presents an analysis of the challenges and opportunities they present. In addition, we propose a concise definition for smart cities: “Smart cities use digital technologies, communication technologies, and data analytics to create an efficient and effective service environment that improves urban quality of life and promotes sustainability”. Smart cities represent a promising avenue for urban development. As cities continue to grow and face increasingly complex challenges, the integration of advanced technologies and data-driven solutions can help to create more sustainable communities.

AB  - This paper aims at analyzing the changes in the fields of speech and natural language processing over the recent past 5 years (2016–2020). It is in continuation of a series of two papers that we published in 2019 on the analysis of the NLP4NLP corpus, which contained articles published in 34 major conferences and journals in the field of speech and natural language processing, over a period of 50 years (1965–2015), and analyzed with the methods developed in the field of NLP, hence its name. The extended NLP4NLP+5 corpus now covers 55 years, comprising close to 90,000 documents [+30% compared with NLP4NLP: as many articles have been published in the single year 2020 than over the first 25 years (1965–1989)], 67,000 authors (+40%), 590,000 references (+80%), and approximately 380 million words (+40%). These analyses are conducted globally or comparatively among sources and also with the general scientific literature, with a focus on the past 5 years. It concludes in identifying profound changes in research topics as well as in the emergence of a new generation of authors and the appearance of new publications around artificial intelligence, neural networks, machine learning, and word embedding.

AB  - Graph theory within power electronics, developed over a 50-year span, is continually evolving, necessitating ongoing research endeavors. Facing with the never-been-seen explosion of graph-structured data, the state-of-the-art deep learning technique-Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), becomes the leading trend in machine learning within just recent five years and demonstrated surprisingly broad and prominent benefits covering from new drug discovery to better IC design. However, its promising applications in Power Electronics are still rarely discussed and its full potential remains unexplored. Addressing this gap, this review paper is the first to outline GNNs' general workflow in power electronics, laying the groundwork and examining current GNN methodologies within the field. To bridge the gap in the sparse GNN literature within this domain, we also provide extended discussions on leveraging insights from GNN-aided circuit design to enrich power electronics research. Our work includes in-depth GNN-based case studies that demonstrate promising applications from converters to system-level power electronics, showcasing GNNs' unique benefits and untapped possibilities (e.g., accurate component design, voltage predictions on IEEE-13 bus and 118 bus systems). Additionally, we provide a comprehensive survey of GNNs' latest and successful applications, emphasizing their impact on energy-centric sectors, such as transportation electrification, smart grids. Considering the interdisciplinary nature of power electronics in modern energy systems, our review highlights the potential of GNNs emerge as a promising tool to decode the intricate behavior and dynamics of power electronics systems, and we hope such synergies between advanced AI methodologies like GNNs with the ever-evolving graph theory can lead to more powerful tools, novel methodologies, and advancements in the power electronics community.

AB  - This study analyzed the historical development of resilience with respect to multidisciplinary aspects using association rule mining (ARM). ARM is a rule-based machine-learning approach tailored to identify validated relations among multiple variables in a large dataset. This study collected author keywords from all resilience-related literature in the Web of Science database and examined the changes in validated resilience-related topics using ARM. We found that resilience-related research tends to diversify and expand over time. Although topics and their academic fields related to engineering and complex adaptive systems were prominent in the early 2000s, psychosocial resilience and social-ecological resilience have received significant attention in recent years. The increasing interest in resilience-related topics linked to psychological and ecological factors, as well as social system components, can be attributed to the impact of a series of complex and global events that occurred in the late 2000s. Recently, resilience has been conceived as a way of thinking, perspective, or paradigm to address emergent complexity and uncertainty with vague concepts. Resilience is increasingly being regarded as a boundary spanner that promotes communication and collaboration among stakeholders who share different interests and scientific knowledge.

AB  - The study and literature on the Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications in agriculture for smart farming are increasing worldwide. However, the knowledge mapping trends related to IoT applications in plant disease, pest management, and control are still unclear and rarely reported. The primary aim of the present study is to identify the current trends and explore hot topics of IoT in plant disease and insect pest research for future research direction. Peer review articles published from Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection (2010-2021) were identified using keywords, and extracted database was analysed scientifically via Microsoft Excel 2019, VOSviewer and R programming software. A total of 231 documents with 5321 cited references authored by 878 scholars showed that the knowledge on the studied area has been growing positively and rapidly for the past ten years. India and China are the most productive countries, comprising more than half (52%) of the total access database on the subject area in WoS. IoT application has been integrated with other knowledge domains, such as machine learning, deep learning, image processing, and artificial intelligence, to produce excellent crop and pest disease monitoring research. This study contributes to the current knowledge of the research topic and suggests possible hot topics for future direction.

AB  - Motivated by the growing significance of the sharing economy, we discuss the roles the public sector may play within the sharing economy and the corresponding implications for public values. The sharing economy represents a transformative agent for the public sector within the current landscape of digital transformation. While the public sector has so far acted mainly as a regulatory body in the sharing economy, we here discuss implications for other roles the public sector may take on, including the roles of customer, service provider, and platform provider. Framed within the context of the public value ideals (professional, efficiency, service, and engagement), we examine the opportunities and challenges of each role for the four public values. Finally, we identify areas for future research, focusing on the implications of public values for the public sector in the sharing economy.

AB  - Learning analytics aims to analyze data from students and learning environments to support learning at different levels. Although learning analytics is a recent field, it reached a high level of maturity, especially in its applications for higher education. However, little of the research in learning analytics targets other educational levels, such as high school. This paper reports the results of a systematic literature review (SLR) focused on the adoption of learning analytics in high schools. More specifically, the SLR followed four steps: the search, selection of relevant studies, critical assessment, and the extraction of the relevant field, which included the main goals, approaches, techniques, and challenges of adopting learning analytics in high school. The results show that, in this context, learning analytics applications are focused on small-scale initiatives rather than institutional adoption. Based on the findings of this study, in combination with the literature, this paper proposes future directions of research and development in order to scale up learning analytics applications in high schools.

AB  - Abstract Connectivity and data exchange are key features of Industry 4.0. In this paradigm, (Industrial) Internet of Things ((I)IoT) devices are a vital component facilitating the collection and transmission of environmental data from the physical system to the central station for processing and analysis (digital twin [DT]). However, although (I)IoT devices play a critical role in this process, they are not inherently equipped to run strong encryption mechanisms to secure the data they transmit over wired or wireless channels. This research aims to explore the potential of DTs in securing Industry 4.0 applications and the security mechanism employed to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of data communicated between (I)IoT and DT through a systematic literature review (SLR). This SLR, based on the analysis of 67 papers published between 2018 and 2023, underscores the evolving significance of DT technology, particularly within the ambit of Industry 4.0. The findings illuminate the pervasive influence of DT technology across multiple industrial sectors. The result SLR revealed that DT is growing and being widely adopted as a security tool particularly in Industry 4.0 using enabling technology like machine learning, data analytics, blockchain, and 5G networks to provide security solutions such as intrusion detection, vulnerability assessment, cyber range, and threat intelligence.

AB  - The present article explores 98 years of creativity research [1922–2020] covering more than 38,000 academic articles on the topic. By applying computational methods rooted in network analysis and text mining, we uncover a history of creativity research spread through 12 major topics of inquiry, including, among others, the psychology of creativity, organisational creativity, creative industries, and idea generation. We also unpack recent trends within the growing body of literature, with a particular focus on business and management. These trends, 36 in total, cover a variety of topics, from the discussions of cultural psychology and distributed creativity to the role that virtual worlds play in the generation of creative outputs. Digitalisation, interdisciplinarity, and multiculturalism emerge as transversal topics across the recent developments. Finally, we discuss how computational methods can help develop comprehensive snapshots of large research fields such as that of creativity and draw subsequent policy implications.

AB  - One of the most critical investment issues faced by different investors is choosing an optimal investment portfolio and balancing risk and return in a way that, maximizes investment returns and minimize the investment risk. So far, many methods have been introduced to form a portfolio, the most famous of the Markowitz approach. The Markowitz mean-variance approach is widely known in the world of finance and, it marks the foundation of every portfolio theory. The mean-variance theory has many practical drawbacks due to the difficulty in estimating the expected return and covariance for different asset classes. In this study, we use the Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) machine learning technique and compare the results with the three methods of Minimum Variance (MVP), Uniform Distribution (UNIF), and Risk Parity (RP). To conduct this research, the adjusted price of 50 listed companies of the Tehran Stock Exchange for 2018-07-01 to 2020-09-29 has been used. 70% of the data are considered as in-sample and the remaining 30% as out-of-sample. We evaluate the results using four criteria: Sharp, Maximum Drawdown, Calmer, Sortino. The results show that the MVP and, UNIF approach within the in-sample and, the UNIF and HRP approach out-of-sample have the best performance in sharp measure.

AB  - Population Studies advances research on fertility, mortality, family, migration, methods, policy and beyond, yet we lack a rigorous review. We examine all papers (N=1,901) and authors (N=3,267) between 1947-2020, employing natural language processing, social network analysis, and mixed-methods which combine unsupervised machine learning with qualitative coders. After a brief history, we map the evolution in authorship and articles to shorter, multi-authored articles, with 34% female authorship and skewed gender ratios across topics. Most examine fertility, mortality and family, studying groups and change, but topics change over time. Children are rarely studied and if so, in relation to infant mortality or parental sex-preferences. Research on women focuses on family planning, contraception, fertility decline, and unions, whereas men’s domains are migration, historical demography (war, famine) and employment. Research on Africa and Asia focuses on family planning, with fertility decline concentrated in North America and Europe. Our results identify future directions for research.

AB  - Мета дослідження полягає в розробці концепції модернізації національної облікової політики з урахуванням глобальних тенденцій та сучасних технологічних досягнень цифрової економіки, що відбувається в контексті парадигми Accounting 4.0 (Industry 4.0). У дослідженні використані такі методи: аналітичний (аналіз та збирання даних предметної області), документальний аналіз (дослідженні нормативних вимог до організації предметної області), експертний (вивчення висновків провідних фахівців щодо досліджуваних аспектів), наукометричний (дослідження рівня наукового супроводу предметної області), компаративний аналіз (корелятивне порівняння експертних та наукових висновків), метод синтезу (формування концепції модернізації національної облікової політики). Оптимальна номенклатура засобів цифрової трансформації національної облікової політики визначена за результатами компаративного аналізу експертної та наукометричної оцінки є синергетичною з урахуванням відмінностей кожного зі загаданих методів оцінки. Результати дослідження вказують на те, що модернізація національної облікової політики може бути досягнута за допомогою впровадження таких цифрових засобів: Cloud Computing, Blockchain Technology, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) та Internet of Things (IoT). Використання цих технологій дозволить забезпечити гнучкість, безпеку, ефективну обробку великого обсягу даних, автоматизацію процесів, підвищену точність і прозорість в обліковій звітності та поліпшення ухвалення рішень. Незважаючи на те, що наразі українська бухгалтерська справа перебуває на стадії імплементації міжнародної системи обміну фінансової інформації (адаптованої до локальних умов) ‒ UA МСФЗ XBRL, відсутні дослідження щодо інструментального супроводу національної системи обліку та аудиту. Упровадження концепції модернізації національної облікової політики згідно з парадигмою Accounting 4.0 (Industry 4.0) має потенціал покращити ефективність та якість обліку й аудиту, сприяти розвиткові цифрової економіки та підвищенню конкурентоспроможності країни на міжнародній арені. Це досягається за допомогою впровадження сучасних цифрових технологій, які забезпечують автоматизацію процесів, покращену аналітику даних та надійність і прозорість у сфері обліку й аудиту. Такі зміни сприятимуть підвищенню продуктивності, зниженню ризиків та зміцненню довіри до фінансової звітності.

We undertook a scoping review on the systematic literature review steps to automate them via computational techniques.&#x0D; Results/Discussion. The process of creating a literature review is both creative and technical. The technical part of this process is liable to automation. Based on the literature, we chose to divide this technical part into four steps: searching, screening, extraction, and synthesis. For each one of these steps, we presented practical artificial intelligence techniques to carry them out. In addition, we presented the obstacles encountered in the application of each technique.&#x0D; Conclusion. We proposed a framework for automatically creating systematic literature reviews by combining and placing existing techniques in stages where they possess the greatest potential to be useful. Despite still lacking practical assessment in different areas of knowledge, this proposal indicates ways with the potential to reduce the time-consuming and repetitive work embedded in the systematic literature review process.&#x0D; Originality/Value. The paper presents the current possibilities for automating systematic literature reviews and how they can work together to reduce researchers’ operational workload.

AB  - As the world moves towards industrialization, optimization problems become more challenging to solve in a reasonable time. More than 500 new metaheuristic algorithms (MAs) have been developed to date, with over 350 of them appearing in the last decade. The literature has grown significantly in recent years and should be thoroughly reviewed. In this study, approximately 540 MAs are tracked, and statistical information is also provided. Due to the proliferation of MAs in recent years, the issue of substantial similarities between algorithms with different names has become widespread. This raises an essential question: can an optimization technique be called 'novel' if its search properties are modified or almost equal to existing methods? Many recent MAs are said to be based on 'novel ideas', so they are discussed. Furthermore, this study categorizes MAs based on the number of control parameters, which is a new taxonomy in the field. MAs have been extensively employed in various fields as powerful optimization tools, and some of their real-world applications are demonstrated. A few limitations and open challenges have been identified, which may lead to a new direction for MAs in the future. Although researchers have reported many excellent results in several research papers, review articles, and monographs during the last decade, many unexplored places are still waiting to be discovered. This study will assist newcomers in understanding some of the major domains of metaheuristics and their real-world applications. We anticipate this resource will also be useful to our research community.

AB  - Novel intelligent systems to assist the energy transition and improve sustainability and people’s life can be deployed at different scales, ranging from a house to an entire region. University campuses are an interesting intermediate size (big enough to matter and small enough to be tractable) for research, development, test and training on the integration of smartness at all levels, which led to the emergence of the concept of “smart campus” over the last few years. This review article proposes an extensive analysis of the scientific literature on smart campuses from the last decade (2010-2020). The 182 selected publications are distributed into seven categories of smartness: smart building, smart environment, smart mobility, smart living, smart people, smart governance and smart data. The main open questions and challenges regarding smart campuses are presented at the end of the review and deal with sustainability and energy transition, acceptability and ethics, learning models, open data policies and interoperability. The present work was carried out within the framework of the Energy Network of the Regional Leaders Summit (RLS-Energy) as part of its multilateral research efforts on smart regions.

AB  - Time series are widely used to record information in applications developed with Internet of Things (IoT) devices, where sensors are used to collect large amounts of data. These devices, even with the exponential technological evolution of the last years, present limitations for the handling of this data given the enormous volume of data collected. Low storage or processing capacity and environments with restricted connection resources make it difficult to manipulate and transmit information. In this context, compression of information collected in the format of time series can be an alternative to reduce the amount of data handled by devices. However, given the peculiarities of IoT devices and applications, the compression process cannot be more costly than handling raw data. To identify the existing solutions to compress time series for IoT applications. In this paper, we present a descriptive systematic literature review on this topic. Based on a well-defined protocol, 40 papers were selected for review to analyze the strategies used, as well as performance and limitations. In this review, we aim to identify different approaches to solving the problem of data compression in the context addressed, as well as identifying directions for future research. The use of performance metrics in the reviewed papers was also reported in detail, to better understand how the authors compare their solutions to others. Additionally, the relationship between time series compression and machine learning (ML) techniques was highlighted. Being aware of the state-of-the-art in time series compression solutions for IoT can help us project future trends and challenges regarding this process and also to identify which algorithms, methods, and techniques can best be used in combination with ML models, the purpose inherent to the IoT context.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a discipline capable of providing significant added value in Medicine, in particular in radiomic, imaging analysis, big dataset analysis, and also for generating virtual cohort of patients. However, in coping with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), considered an easily managed malignancy after the introduction of TKIs which strongly improved the life expectancy of patients, AI is still in its infancy. Noteworthy, the findings of initial trials are intriguing and encouraging, both in terms of performance and adaptability to different contexts in which AI can be applied. Indeed, the improvement of diagnosis and prognosis by leveraging biochemical, biomolecular, imaging, and clinical data can be crucial for the implementation of the personalized medicine paradigm or the streamlining of procedures and services. In this review, we present the state of the art of AI applications in the field of CML, describing the techniques and objectives, and with a general focus that goes beyond Machine Learning (ML), but instead embraces the wider AI field. The present scooping review spans on publications reported in Pubmed from 2003 to 2023, and resulting by searching “chronic myeloid leukemia” and “artificial intelligence”. The time frame reflects the real literature production and was not restricted. We also take the opportunity for discussing the main pitfalls and key points to which AI must respond, especially considering the critical role of the ‘human’ factor, which remains key in this domain.

AB  - With the explosive growth of online social media, the ancient problem of information disorders interfering with news diffusion has surfaced with a renewed intensity threatening our democracies, public health, and news outlets’ credibility. Therefore, thousands of scientific papers have been published in a relatively short period, making researchers of different disciplines struggle with an information overload problem. The aim of this survey is threefold: (1) we present the results of a network-based analysis of the existing multidisciplinary literature to support the search for relevant trends and central publications; (2) we describe the main results and necessary background to attack the problem under a computational perspective; (3) we review selected contributions using network science as a unifying framework and computational linguistics as the tool to make sense of the shared content. Despite scholars working on computational linguistics and networks traditionally belong to different scientific communities, we expect that those interested in the area of fake news should be aware of crucial aspects of both disciplines.

AB  - Assessing the credibility of research claims is a central, continuous, and laborious part of the scientific process. Credibility assessment strategies range from expert judgment to aggregating existing evidence to systematic replication efforts. Such assessments can require substantial time and effort. Research progress could be accelerated if there were rapid, scalable, accurate credibility indicators to guide attention and resource allocation for further assessment. The SCORE program is creating and validating algorithms to provide confidence scores for research claims at scale. To investigate the viability of scalable tools, teams are creating: a database of claims from papers in the social and behavioral sciences; expert and machine generated estimates of credibility; and, evidence of reproducibility, robustness, and replicability to validate the estimates. Beyond the primary research objective, the data and artifacts generated from this program will be openly shared and provide an unprecedented opportunity to examine research credibility and evidence.

AB  - It is undoubtedly of great impression how some of the areas of evolving Computational Sciences, such as Machine Learning and the great and vast nanotechnology domain, can contribute to all-world research.Some examples are nanotoxicology in medicine and food regulation, using predictive models to study the biological activity of nanomaterials, characterization of nanoparticles, and against COVID-19, with the development of vaccines and nanosensors.The relationship between nanotechnology and machine learning was investigated through bibliometric analysis using articles registered in the Scopus database.The keywords "Machine Learning" and "Nanotechnology" were searched in the Scopus database to develop this work.Two hundred sixty-seven scientific articles were gathered using the number of publications per year, area of knowledge, and countries as search criterions.Then, the titles and abstracts of these papers were stored in Research Information Systems (RIS) format and went through automatic analysis by the software "Visualization Of Similarities Method" (VOS viewer) version 1.6.18., which gave us a notion of link strength produced by their intercorrelation network with maps of Clusters, which was followed by a numerical criterion.Due to the limitation of VOSViewer to integrate and process the data in tables, tree maps, or graphics, Python can import and filter the data.So, it is possible to create new forms of visualizing data and the relationship between them using Python software.The trendline that describes the volume of publications as a function of the year assumes a third-order polynomial behavior, with R²=0.9716.Furthermore, the present work inferred the ten countries with the highest volume of publications that intersect the two areas between researched years.The United States, China, and the United Kingdom lead the volume of publications, with a significant difference between the amount of US publications and the subsequent ones.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has frightened people worldwide, and coronavirus has become the most commonly used phrase in recent years. Therefore, there is a need for a systematic literature review (SLR) related to Big Data applications in the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The objective is to highlight recent technological advancements. Many studies emphasize the area of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Our study categorizes the many applications used to manage and control the pandemic. There is a very limited SLR prospective of COVID-19 with Big Data. Our SLR study picked five databases: Science direct, IEEE Xplore, Springer, ACM, and MDPI. Before the screening, following the recommendation, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) were reported for 893 studies from 2019, 2020 and until September 2021. After screening, 60 studies met the inclusion criteria through COVID-19 data statistics, and Big Data analysis was used as the search string. Our research’s findings successfully dealt with COVID-19 healthcare with risk diagnosis, estimation or prevention, decision making, and drug Big Data applications problems. We believe that this review study will motivate the research community to perform expandable and transparent research against the pandemic crisis of COVID-19.

AB  - There are different bovine infectious diseases that show economic losses and social problems in various sectors of the economy. Most of the studies are focused on some diseases (for example, tuberculosis, salmonellosis, and brucellosis), but there are few studies on other diseases which are not officially controlled but also have an impact on the economy. This work is a systematic literature review on models (as a theoretical scheme, generally in mathematical form) used in the epidemiological analysis of bovine infectious diseases in the dairy farming sector. In this systematic literature review, criteria were defined for cattle, models, and infectious diseases to select articles on Scopus, IEEE, Xplorer, and ACM databases. The relations between the found models (model type, function and the proposed objective in each work) and the bovine infectious diseases, and the different techniques used and the works over infectious disease in humans, are presented. The outcomes obtained in this systematic literature review provide the state-of-the-art inputs for research on models for the epidemiological analysis of infectious bovine diseases. As a consequence of these outcomes, this work also presents an approach of EiBeLec, which is an adaptive and predictive system for the bovine ecosystem, combining a prediction model that uses machine-learning techniques and an adaptive model that adapts the information presented to end users.

AB  - The ICT revolution has given birth to a world of digital traces. A wide number of knowledge-driven domains like science are daily fueled by unlimited flows of textual contents. In order to navigate across these growing constellations of words, interdisciplinary innovations are emerging at the crossroad between social and computational sciences. In particular, complex systems approaches make it now possible to reconstruct multi-level and multi-scale dynamics of knowledge by means of inheritance networks of elements of knowledge called phylomemies. In this article, we will introduce an endogenous way to visualize the multi-level and multi-scale properties of phylomemies. The resulting system will enrich a state-of-the-art tree like representation with the possibility to browse through the evolution of a corpus of documents at different level of observation, to interact with various scales of description, to reconstruct a hierarchical clustering of elements of knowledge and to navigate across complex semantic lineages. We will then formalize a generic macro-to-micro methodology of exploration and implement our system as a free software called the Memiescape. Our system will be illustrated by three use cases that will respectively reconstruct the scientific landscape of the top cited publications of the French CNRS, the evolution of the state of the art of knowledge dynamics visualization and the ongoing discovery process of Covid-19 vaccines.

AB  - In the current days of information overload, it is nearly impossible to obtain a form of relevant knowledge from massive information repositories without using information retrieval and filtering tools. The academic field daily receives lots of research articles, thus making it virtually impossible for researchers to trace and retrieve important articles for their research work. Unfortunately, the tools used to search, retrieve and recommend relevant research papers suggest similar articles based on the user profile characteristic, resulting in the overspecialization problem whereby recommendations are boring, similar, and uninteresting. We attempt to address this problem by recommending research papers from domains considered unrelated and unconnected. This is achieved through identifying bridging concepts that can bridge these two unrelated domains through their outlying concepts – BiSOLinkers. We modeled a bisociation framework using graph theory and text mining technologies. Machine learning algorithms were utilized to identify outliers within the dataset, and the accuracy achieved by most algorithms was between 96.30% and 99.49%, suggesting that the classifiers accurately classified and identified the outliers. We additionally utilized the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm to identify the topics bridging the two unrelated domains at their point of intersection. BisoNets were finally generated, conceptually demonstrating how the two unrelated domains were linked, necessitating cross-domain recommendations. Hence, it is established that recommender systems' overspecialization can be addressed by combining bisociation, topic modeling, and text mining approaches.

AB  - The rapid growth of Industry 4.0 and predictive methods fostered a great potential for state-of-the-art techniques in the industrial sector, especially in smart factories. The equipment failure or system breakdowns during run time of a factory creates a severe problems towards impoverishment of the production system and destitution of the business. Predictive Maintenance (PdM) is a cost-saving and data driven technique to predict the maintenance time of in-service equipment or systems to reduce breakdown time and increase productivity. Although PdM is pragmatically adopted in large-scale industries, there is a lack of studies that map the PdM adoption in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In this systematic mapping study (SMS), we focus on predictive maintenance from an SME perspective to explore the field for researchers, scientists, and developers to comprehend the potential of PdM systems, their challenges, distinctive characteristics, and best practices in SMEs. Our study is based on four research questions comprised of demographic data, key challenges, distinctive characteristics, and best practices of predictive maintenance in SMEs. We found that the current literature on PdM is deficient in the SME domain, especially the financial side is vague. There is a huge potential for PdM in SMEs to design cost models and focus on data availability impediments. Management and monitoring of PdM and skilled personnel are also inadequate. Thus, we present a study that extracts the knowledge from the existing literature about PdM in SMEs, finds the research gap, and can assist in identifying the barriers and challenges of PdM adoption in SMEs.

AB  - The increasingly available large-scale bibliographic data that generate a heterogeneous network provide opportunities to detect, track, and predict the evolution of science.Recently, many efforts have been devoted to quantifying the impact of scientific papers within different citation time windows.However, the complex patterns of the citation network make it difficult to predict future citations on the basis of a short time window.Accordingly, we present a data-centric methodology to predict long-term scientific impact by combining numerous bibliographic features and convolutional neural network.More specifically, we first expand the input features from the annual citation records to the features of the whole heterogeneous bibliographic information network that completely represents the topology structure of academic activities.Then, a convolutional neural network model is designed to capture the complex nonlinear relationships between the early network features and the final cumulative citation count.Finally, we conduct an experiment on papers of Markov Chain from 1980 to 1985.The result shows that the prediction performance can be improved by 5% to baseline models under the same problem definition and with the same dataset.Meanwhile, the long-term scientific impacts are strongly correlated with its recognition by authoritative authors or venues in the early stage.

AB  - With the advent of the World Wide Web, there are numerous online platforms that generate huge amounts of textual material, including social networks, online blogs, magazines, etc. This textual content contains useful information that can be used to advance humanity. Text summarization has been a significant area of research in natural language processing (NLP). With the expansion of the internet, the amount of data in the world has exploded. Large volumes of data make locating the required and best information time-consuming. It is impractical to manually summarize petabytes of data; hence, computerized text summarization is rising in popularity. This study presents a comprehensive overview of the current status of text summarizing approaches, techniques, standard datasets, assessment criteria, and future research directions. The summarizing approaches are assessed based on several characteristics, including approach-based, document-number-based, Summarization domain-based, document-language-based, output summary nature, etc. This study concludes with a discussion of many obstacles and research opportunities linked to text summarizing research that may be relevant for future researchers in this field.

AB  - The surge in legal text production has amplified the workload for legal professionals, making many tasks repetitive and time-consuming. Furthermore, the complexity and specialized language of legal documents pose challenges not just for those in the legal domain but also for the general public. This emphasizes the potential role and impact of Legal Natural Language Processing (Legal NLP). Although advancements have been made in this domain, particularly after 2015 with the advent of Deep Learning and Large Language Models (LLMs), a systematic exploration of this progress until 2022 is nonexistent. In this research, we perform a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) to bridge this gap.We aim to provide a descriptive statistical analysis of the Legal NLP research between 2015 and 2022. Categorize and sub-categorize primary publications based on their research problems. Identify limitations and areas of improvement in current research. Using a robust search methodology across four reputable indexers, we filtered 536 papers down to 75 pivotal articles. Our findings reveal the diverse methods employed for tasks such as Multiclass Classification, Summarization, and Question Answering in the Legal NLP field.We also highlight resources, challenges, and gaps in current methodologies and emphasize the need for curated datasets, ontologies, and a focus on inherent difficulties like data accessibility. As the legal sector gradually embraces Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding the capabilities and limitations of Legal NLP becomes vital for ensuring efficient and ethical application. The research offers insights for both Legal NLP researchers and the broader legal community, advocating for continued advancements in automation while also addressing ethical concerns.

AB  - Abstract In the field of art, machine learning models have been used to predict artistic styles in paintings. The foregoing is somewhat advantageous for analysts, as these tools can provide more valuable results and help reduce bias in the results and conclusions provided. Therefore, the objective of this research was to examine research trends in the use of machine learning to predict artistic styles from a bibliometric review based on the PRISMA methodology. From the search equations, 268 documents were found, out of which, following the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 128 documents were analyzed. Through quantitative analysis, a growing research interest in the subject is evident, progressing from user perception approaches to the utilization of tools like deep learning for art studies. Among the main results, it is possible to identify that one of the most used techniques in the field has been neural networks for pattern recognition. Also, a large part of the research focuses on the use of design software for image creation and manipulation. Finally, it is found that the number of studies focused on contemporary modern art is still limited, this is due to the fact that a large part of the investigations has focused on historical artistic styles.

AB  - Researchers often need to gather a comprehensive set of papers relevant to a focused topic, but this is often difficult and time-consuming using existing search methods. For example, keyword searching suffers from difficulties with synonyms and multiple meanings. While some automated research-paper recommender systems exist, these typically depend on either a researcher&#x2019;s entire library or just a single paper, resulting in either a quite broad or a quite narrow search. With these issues in mind, we built a new research-paper recommender system that utilizes both citation information and textual similarity of abstracts to provide a highly focused set of relevant results. The input to this system is a set of one or more related papers, and our system searches for papers that are closely related to the entire set. This framework helps researchers gather a set of papers that are closely related to a particular topic of interest, and allows control over which cross-section of the literature is located. We show the effectiveness of this recommender system by using it to recreate the references of review papers. We also show its utility as a general similarity metric between scientific articles by performing unsupervised clustering on sets of scientific articles. We release an implementation, ExCiteSearch (bitbucket.org/mmmontemore/excitesearch), to allow researchers to apply this framework to locate relevant scientific articles.

AB  - Scientific convergence is a phenomenon where the distance between hitherto distinct scientific fields narrows and the fields gradually overlap over time.It is creating important potential for research, development, and innovation.Although scientific convergence is crucial for the development of radically new technology, the identification of emerging scientific convergence is particularly difficult since the underlying knowledge flows are rather fuzzy and unstable in the early convergence stage.Nevertheless, novel scientific publications emerging at the intersection of different knowledge fields may reflect convergence processes.Thus, in this article, we exploit the growing number of research and digital libraries providing bibliographic metadata to propose an automated analysis of science dynamics.We utilize and adapt machine-learning methods (DeepWalk) to automatically learn a similarity measure between scientific fields from graphs constructed on bibliographic metadata.With a time-based perspective, we apply our approach to analyze the trajectories of evolving similarities between scientific fields.We validate the learned similarity measure by evaluating it within the well-explored case of cholesterol-lowering ingredients in which scientific convergence between the distinct scientific fields of nutrition and pharmaceuticals has partially taken place.Our results confirm that the similarity trajectories learned by our approach resemble the expected behavior, indicating that our approach may allow researchers and practitioners to detect and predict scientific convergence early.

AB  - Abstract Multiple studies have investigated bibliometric features and uncategorized scholarly documents for the influential scholarly document prediction task. In this paper, we describe our work that attempts to go beyond bibliometric metadata to predict influential scholarly documents. Furthermore, this work also examines the influential scholarly document prediction task over categorized scholarly documents. We also introduce a new approach to enhance the document representation method with a domain-independent knowledge graph to find the influential scholarly document using categorized scholarly content. As the input collection, we use the WHO corpus with scholarly documents on the theme of COVID-19. This study examines different document representation methods for machine learning, including TF-IDF, BOW, and embedding-based language models (BERT). The TF-IDF document representation method works better than others. From various machine learning methods tested, logistic regression outperformed the other for scholarly document category classification, and the random forest algorithm obtained the best results for influential scholarly document prediction, with the help of a domain-independent knowledge graph, specifically DBpedia, to enhance the document representation method for predicting influential scholarly documents with categorical scholarly content. In this case, our study combines state-of-the-art machine learning methods with the BOW document representation method. We also enhance the BOW document representation with the direct type (RDF type) and unqualified relation from DBpedia. From this experiment, we did not find any impact of the enhanced document representation for the scholarly document category classification. We found an effect in the influential scholarly document prediction with categorical data.

AB  - In recent years, emerging technologies such as immersive virtual reality (IVR) and Metaverse are pointing to new directions for the future of education. To summarise the current research status and development trend of immersive virtual reality in the field of education, this paper used the CiteSpace tool to search the SSCI literature included in the Web of Science under the theme of “Immersive virtual reality” or “Educational technology”. The results show a total of 1293 SSCI publications between 1996 and 2022, with the number of studies in this area increasing year on year. Current research hot spots focus on the application of IVR technology, evaluation and effectiveness research, and curriculum design and teaching. Analysis of node network diagrams and knowledge graphs suggest that future trends in the field will be to deepen immersive experiences, increase interactivity, and continue to explore more pedagogical value and application scenarios. In addition, there are increasingly close partnerships between research institutions and large-scale collaborative research is taking place internationally. In future research, researchers can explore scenarios for the application of Metaverse and the design of assessment systems that can facilitate the development of immersive education.

AB  - Landscape perspectives in riverine ecology have been undertaken increasingly in the last 30 years, leading aquatic ecologists to develop a diverse set of approaches for conceptualizing, mapping and understanding 'riverscapes'. Spatiotemporally explicit perspectives of rivers and their biota nested within the socio-ecological landscape now provide guiding principles and approaches in inland fisheries and watershed management. During the last two decades, scientific literature on riverscapes has increased rapidly, indicating that the term and associated approaches are serving an important purpose in freshwater science and management. We trace the origins and theoretical foundations of riverscape perspectives and approaches and examine trends in the published literature to assess the state of the science and demonstrate how they are being applied to address recent challenges in the management of riverine ecosystems. We focus on approaches for studying and visualizing rivers and streams with remote sensing, modelling and sampling designs that enable pattern detection as seen from above (e.g. river channel, floodplain, and riparian areas) but also into the water itself (e.g. aquatic organisms and the aqueous environment). Key concepts from landscape ecology that are central to riverscape approaches are heterogeneity, scale (resolution, extent and scope) and connectivity (structural and functional), which underpin spatial and temporal aspects of study design, data collection and analysis. Mapping of physical and biological characteristics of rivers and floodplains with high-resolution, spatially intensive techniques improves understanding of the causes and ecological consequences of spatial patterns at multiple scales. This information is crucial for managing river ecosystems, especially for the successful implementation of conservation, restoration and monitoring programs. Recent advances in remote sensing, field-sampling approaches and geospatial technology are making it increasingly feasible to collect high-resolution data over larger scales in space and time. We highlight challenges and opportunities and discuss future avenues of research with emerging tools that can potentially help to overcome obstacles to collecting, analysing and displaying these data. This synthesis is intended to help researchers and resource managers understand and apply these concepts and approaches to address real-world problems in freshwater management.

AB  - Success and failure in software engineering are still among the least understood phenomena in the discipline. In a recent special journal issue on the topic, Mäntylä et al. started discussing these topics from different angles; the authors focused their contributions on offering a general overview of both topics without deeper detail. Recognizing the importance and impact of the topic, in this article we have executed a followup, more in-depth systematic literature review with additional analyses beyond what was previously provided. These new analyses offer: a grounded-theory of success and failure factors, harvesting over 500+ factors from the literature; 14 manually validated clusters of factors that provide relevant areas for success- and failure-specific measurement and risk-analysis; a quality model composed of previously unmeasured organizational structure quantities which are germane to software product, process, and community quality. We show that the topics of success and failure deserve further study as well as further automated tool support, e.g., monitoring tools and metrics able to track the factors and patterns emerging from this article. This article provides managers with risks as well as a more fine-grained analysis of the parameters that can be appraised to anticipate the risks.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic presented a challenge to the global research community as they rushed to find solutions to the devastating crisis. Drawing expectations from resilience theory, this paper explores how the trajectory of coronavirus research was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Using terms featured in articles in early COVID-19 research, and pathways of knowledge characterized through term extraction, evolutionary pathways and statistical analysis, the results reveal that the pandemic disrupted existing lines of coronavirus research to a large degree. While broad communities of coronavirus research are similar pre- and during COVID-19, topics themselves change significantly and there is less cohesion amongst early COVID-19 research compared to that within research before the pandemic. We find that some lines of research revert to research pursued almost a decade earlier, whilst others pursue brand new trajectories, and that Chinese researchers in particular appear to be driving the more novel research. These findings suggest that the global research community maintained a similar broad research focus from before the pandemic, but shifted the detail of the research in the COVID-19 period, exploring diverse pathways, and that specific actors are more flexible than others in doing so. The findings raise further questions about whether the shifts are advantageous for global scientific progress, and whether the research community will return to the original equilibrium or reorganize into a different knowledge configuration.

AB  - This research provides a systematic analysis of 115 previous literatures on the use of academic social networking sites (ASNs) in scholarly communication. Previous research on the subject has mainly taken a disciplinary and user perspective. This research conceptualizes the use of ASNs in scholarly communication in the space between social interactions and the technologies themselves. Keyword analysis and scoping review approaches have been used to analyze the comprehensive literature in the field. The study found a geographic variation in what motivates academics to use ASNs. Scholar discovery and sharing are the primary driving factors identified in the literature. Four main themes within the research literature are proposed: motivation and uses, impact assessment, features and services, and scholarly big data. The study found that there has been an increase in scholarly big data research in recent years. The paper also discusses the key findings and concepts stated in each theme. This gives academics a better understanding of what ASNs can do and their weaknesses, and identifies gaps in the literature that are worth addressing in future investigations. We suggest that future studies may also extend the existing theoretical framework and epistemological approaches to better predict and clarify the socio-technical dimensions of ASNs use in scholarly communication. In addition, this study has implications for academic and research institutions, libraries and information literacy programs, and future studies on the topic.

AB  - Context-aware recommender systems dedicated to online social networks experienced noticeable growth in the last few years. This has led to more research being done in this area stimulated by the omnipresence of smartphones and the latest web technologies. These systems are able to detect specific user needs and adapt recommendations to actual user context. In this research, we present a comprehensive review of context-aware recommender systems developed for social networks. For this purpose, we used a systematic literature review methodology which clearly defined the scope, the objective, the timeframe, the methods, and the tools to undertake this research. Our focus is to investigate approaches and techniques used in the development of context-aware recommender systems for social networks and identify the research gaps, challenges, and opportunities in this field. In order to have a clear vision of the research potential in the field, we considered research articles published between 2015 and 2020 and used a research portal giving access to major scientific research databases. Primary research articles selected are reviewed and the recommendation process is analyzed to identify the approach, the techniques, and the context elements employed in the development of the recommendation systems. The paper presents the detail of the review study, provides a synthesis of the results, proposes an evaluation based on measurable evaluation tools developed in this study, and advocates future research and development pathways in this interesting field.

AB  - Deep learning (DL) is becoming a fast-growing field in the medical domain and it helps in the timely detection of any infectious disease (IDs) and is essential to the management of diseases and the prediction of future occurrences. Many scientists and scholars have implemented DL techniques for the detection and prediction of pandemics, IDs and other healthcare-related purposes, these outcomes are with various limitations and research gaps. For the purpose of achieving an accurate, efficient and less complicated DL-based system for the detection and prediction of pandemics, therefore, this study carried out a systematic literature review (SLR) on the detection and prediction of pandemics using DL techniques. The survey is anchored by four objectives and a state-of-the-art review of forty-five papers out of seven hundred and ninety papers retrieved from different scholarly databases was carried out in this study to analyze and evaluate the trend of DL techniques application areas in the detection and prediction of pandemics. This study used various tables and graphs to analyze the extracted related articles from various online scholarly repositories and the analysis showed that DL techniques have a good tool in pandemic detection and prediction. Scopus and Web of Science repositories are given attention in this current because they contain suitable scientific findings in the subject area. Finally, the state-of-the-art review presents forty-four (44) studies of various DL technique performances. The challenges identified from the literature include the low performance of the model due to computational complexities, improper labeling and the absence of a high-quality dataset among others. This survey suggests possible solutions such as the development of improved DL-based techniques or the reduction of the output layer of DL-based architecture for the detection and prediction of pandemic-prone diseases as future considerations.

AB  - Cryptographic forms of money are distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) computerized exchange mediums, where the exchanges or records are secured through a protected hash set of secure hash algorithm-256 (SHA-256) and message digest 5 (MD5) calculations. Since their initiation, the prices seem highly volatile and came to their amazing cutoff points during the COVID-19 pandemic. This factor makes them a popular choice for investors with an aim to get higher returns over a short span of time. The colossal high points and low points in digital forms of money costs have drawn in analysts from the scholarly community as well as ventures to foresee their costs. A few machines and deep learning algorithms like gated recurrent unit (GRU), long short-term memory (LSTM), autoregressive integrated moving average with explanatory variable (ARIMAX), and a lot more have been utilized to exactly predict and investigate the elements influencing cryptocurrency prices. The current literature is totally centered around the forecast of digital money costs disregarding its reliance on other cryptographic forms of money.

Motivated from these, we present a cryptocurrency price prediction framework in this paper. It acknowledges different cryptographic forms of money (which are subject to one another) as information and yields higher accuracy. To illustrate this concept, we have considered a price prediction of <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Dash</i> coin through the past days’ prices of <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Dash</i> , <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Litecoin</i> , and <italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Bitcoin</i> as they have hierarchical dependency among them at the protocol level. We can portray the outcomes that the proposed scheme predicts the prices with low misfortune and high precision. The model can be applied to different digital money cost expectations.

AB  - This article examines the knowledge structure of the journal Technology Forecasting and Social Change (TFSC) from its inception in 1969 until 2020. In this paper we argue that the structure of knowledge in the field of technological forecasting is more complex than a topic model – a bag of words – can in fact effectively reveal. Therefore we propose and demonstrate a hierarchical model that selectively combines topics at varying levels of generality. The resultant analysis, which is based on non-negative matrix factorization, reveals four distinct branches of technology forecasting work, composed of seven distinct topics. Each topic and branch are examined individually through a detailed examination of terms and keywords. Representative works and authors in each of the branches are also identified. The method enables the examination of the complex structure of knowledge in a scientific journal in a succinct representation. The resultant analysis can assist future researchers, enabling them to better position their work, and to better identify the key references across the various subject silos.

AB  - Considering reverse logistics’ benefit for sustainability, it has gained significant attention as a strategic decision. Additionally, a geometric expansion occurs in reverse logistics and sustainability performance. Despite this, little has been written about this evolution retrospectively. Therefore, this study aims to conceptualise and perform a systematic scientometric review of reverse logistics and sustainability performance to identify research hotspots and emerging trends and offer suggestions for future research agendas by reviewing, retrieving, and analysing 848 papers from the Scopus databases. Based on the analysis, there was a rapid rise in the number of publications within this domain, while, at the same time, increasing interdisciplinary subject research has appeared. Furthermore, scholars and institutions from China, India, and the USA were the most prolific in this research domain. Mainly, the current study underscored some pivotal research hotspots, such as assessing the reverse logistics effect on different sustainability performance dimensions and developing a reverse logistics and sustainability performance network. Moreover, emerging trends include game theory, artificial intelligence, Industry 4.0, the manufacturing industry of developing countries, and the circular economy. Finally, a moderator was also sought to be proposed to optimise the relationship between reverse logistics and sustainability performance due to the inconsistent link between them. Having a comprehensive overview of reverse logistics and sustainability performance over the last 24 years may help practitioners and researchers better understand global trends and directions in this field.

AB  - Platform-based product development has been applied extensively in discrete manufacturing industry to accommodate changing market demands. Nevertheless, while process industry manufacturers face similar market demands, the topic is only sparsely covered in literature. Through a systematic review of the literature, this study uncovers the definitions used, drivers behind, approaches and methods applied, and industry examples of platform-based product development in the process industry. Based on these analyses, a research agenda is then proposed to further the knowledge of this topic. The study identified existing definitions of key platform-related terms used in several studies and furthermore discovered new definitions for some terms. The most prominent drivers behind pursuing platform-based product development was found to be cost reduction and productivity of product development, with development lead time reduction playing a less significant role. Literature related to platform-based product development focuses primarily on product design and development issues, with less attention given to market, manufacturing, and supply chain issues. Only few industrial cases were identified within the process industry while multiple anecdotal descriptions were discovered. For future research, further insight into key platform concepts, applicability of existing methods, broader value chain focus and detailed industrial cases are considered relevant.

AB  - In the last six decades, many advances have been made in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Bearing in mind that AI technologies are influencing societies and political systems differently, it can be useful to understand what are the common issues between similar states in the European Union and how these political systems can collaborate with each other, seeking synergies, finding opportunities and saving costs. Therefore, we carried out an exploratory research among similar states of the European Union, in terms of scientific research in areas of AI technologies, namely: Portugal, Greece, Austria, Belgium and Sweden. A key finding of this research is that intelligent decision support systems (IDSS) are essential for the political decision-making process, since politics normally deals with complex and multifaceted decisions, which involve trade-offs between different stakeholders. As public health is becoming increasingly relevant in the field of the European Union, the IDSSs can provide relevant contributions, as it may allow sharing critical information and assist in the political decision-making process, especially in response to crisis situations.

AB  - Abstract We contribute to the debate on societal impact of SSH by developing a methodology that allows a fine-grained observation of social groups that make use, directly or indirectly, of the results of research. We develop a lexicon of users with 76,857 entries, which saturates the semantic field of social groups of users and allows normalization. We use the lexicon in order to filter text structures in the 6637 impact case studies collected under the Research Excellence Framework in the UK. We then follow the steps recommended by Börner et al. (Annu Rev Inf Sci Technol 37:179–255, 2003) to build up visual maps of science, using co-occurrence of words describing users of research. We explore the properties of this novel kind of maps, in which science is seen from the perspective of research users.

AB  - We study the evolution of topics in economics and their geographical specialization by analyzing 13,233 papers from seven top journals between 1985 and 2012 and their forward citations. The share of U.S. publications declines from 75% to 64% with a corresponding increase of the European share from 12% to 24%. We use topic modeling and document the evolution of the discipline over 27 years. We estimate, with a quasi‐structural model, the citation lag distribution for 18 different topics and three large geographical areas. The modal citation lag is about 6.7 years in the entire sample and 4.8 years for citations from the top 100 journals. We quantify (1) the home bias effect in citations, (2) how it fades away over time, (3) the long lasting impact of U.S. publications vis‐à‐vis other geographical areas, and (4) the higher speed of diffusion and faster obsolescence in the United States.

AB  - Abstract In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been used in most if not all domains and has greatly benefited our lives. While AI can accurately extract critical features and valuable information from large amounts of data to help people complete tasks faster, there are growing concerns about the non-transparency of AI in the decision-making process. The emergence of explainable AI (XAI) has allowed humans to better understand and control AI systems, which is motivated to provide transparent explanations for the decisions made by AI. This article aims to present a comprehensive overview of recent research on XAI approaches from three well-defined taxonomies. We offer an in-depth analysis and summary of the status and prospects of XAI applications in several key areas where reliable explanations are urgently needed to avoid mistakes in decision-making. We conclude by discussing XAI’s limitations and future research directions.

AB  - &lt;p&gt;Actualmente, estamos en una situación de tránsito en la manera de impartir docencia, provocado por el COVID-19. En muy poco tiempo, los estudiantes se han vistos forzados a introducir en su proceso de enseñanza-aprendizaje el uso de recursos digitales que les permita seguir aprendiendo. Frente a esta situación, se requiere una adecuada competencia digital, entendida no como una habilidad única, sino como un conjunto de habilidades que facilitan el uso de tecnología educativa, el trabajo en equipo, el pensamiento crítico, la creatividad y la comunicación. El objetivo de este trabajo es proponer un modelo estructural causal de las dimensiones que configuran la competencia digital en estudiantes universitarios. El estudio se hizo con una muestra no probabilística constituida por 17301 estudiantes procedentes de la Universidad Andrés Bello de Chile. La validez de este instrumento se ha llevado a cabo a partir de la aplicación del método de mínimos cuadrados parciales (PLS) de los modelos de ecuaciones estructurales. El principal resultado fue que el modelo explicaba un 32.90% de la varianza verdadera de la competencia digital del estudiantado. Además, se ha permitido verificar la fiabilidad, validez convergente y discriminante de las relaciones causales establecidas, determinando un modelo con una bondad de ajuste aceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

AB  - Researchers are often faced with exploring new research domains. Broad questions about the research domain, such as who are the influential authors or what are important topics, are difficult to answer due to the overwhelming number of relevant publications. Therefore, we present litstudy: a Python package that enables answering such questions using simple scripts or Jupyter notebooks. The package enables selecting scientific publications and studying their metadata using visualizations, bibliographic network analysis, and natural language processing. The software was previously used in a publication on the landscape of Exascale computing, and we envision great potential for reuse.

AB  - For over five decades, researchers have used network analysis to understand educational contexts, spanning diverse disciplines and thematic areas. The wealth of traditions and insights accumulated through these interdisciplinary efforts is a challenge to synthesize with a traditional systematic review. To overcome this difficulty in reviewing 1791 articles researching the intersection of networks and education, this study combined a scientometric approach with a more qualitative analysis of metadata, such as keywords and authors. Our analysis shows rapidly growing research that employs network analysis in educational contexts. This research output is produced by researchers in a small number of developed countries. The field has grown more recently, through the surge in the popularity of data-driven methods, the adoption of social media, and themes as teacher professional development and the now-declining MOOC research. Our analysis suggests that research combining networks and educational phenomena continues to lack an academic home, as well as remains dominated by descriptive network methods that depict phenomena such as interpersonal friendship or patterns of discourse-based collaboration. We discuss the gaps in existing research, the methodological shortcomings, the possible future directions and most importantly how network research could help advance our knowledge of learning, learners, and contribute to our knowledge and to learning theories.

AB  - Due to its widespread occurrence in practically all environmental sectors, including the terrestrial, marine, and atmospheric, microplastics (MP) have transitioned from an emerging pollutant to a chronic contaminant. Studies on the prevalence and hazardous effects on marine creatures have been conducted all over the world, but only in coastal environments. Microplastic pollution has emerged as a global concern in marine environments and a danger to animals, predators, and humans because it has been discovered in the marine environment all over the world. This review examines the quantity of MP samples around the world and their colonization by marine microorganisms, as well as the detection, features, origins, and ecological implications of paint fragments and resins in our oceans and ports. These polymers are derived from paints and the fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) matrix used in shipbuilding. Microplastics should be regarded as coming from synthetic polymers found in ship coatings. For assessing microplastic pollution, choosing an appropriate sample technique is essential. Additionally, this review offers an overview of MP investigation methods, concentrating on sampling techniques, laboratory procedures, and the identification of MPs found in seawater, as well as assessing how well they apply to the seaport environment. Because of the widespread discovery of MP pollution, particularly in Africa, Asia, India, South Africa, North America, and Europe, it is clear that monitoring is crucial for determining the efficacy of mitigation efforts to limit the quantity of waste plastic entering the environment, especially through sensors and real-time information transfer systems (e.g., smart digital seawater monitoring).

AB  - This paper reviews the advances, challenges, and approaches of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in the banking sector. The use of these technologies is accelerating in various industries, including banking. However, the literature on banking is scattered, making a global understanding difficult. This study reviewed the main approaches in terms of applications and algorithmic models, as well as the benefits and challenges associated with their implementation in banking, in addition to a bibliometric analysis of variables related to the distribution of publications and the most productive countries, as well as an analysis of the co-occurrence and dynamics of keywords. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) framework, forty articles were selected for review. The results indicate that these technologies are used in the banking sector for customer segmentation, credit risk analysis, recommendation, and fraud detection. It should be noted that credit analysis and fraud detection are the most implemented areas, using algorithms such as random forests (RF), decision trees (DT), support vector machines (SVM), and logistic regression (LR), among others. In addition, their use brings significant benefits for decision-making and optimizing banking operations. However, the handling of substantial amounts of data with these technologies poses ethical challenges.

AB  - In this paper we describe a holistic AI forecasting framework which draws on a broad body of literature from disciplines such as forecasting, technological forecasting, futures studies and scenario planning. A review of this literature leads us to propose a new class of scenario planning techniques that we call scenario mapping techniques. These techniques include scenario network mapping, cognitive maps and fuzzy cognitive maps, as well as a new method we propose that we refer to as judgmental distillation mapping. This proposed technique is based on scenario mapping and judgmental forecasting techniques, and is intended to integrate a wide variety of forecasts into a technological map with probabilistic timelines. Judgmental distillation mapping is the centerpiece of the holistic forecasting framework in which it is used to inform a strategic planning process as well as for informing future iterations of the forecasting process. Together, the framework and new technique form a holistic rethinking of how we forecast AI. We also include a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the framework, its implications for practice and its implications on research priorities for AI forecasting researchers.

AB  - The objective of this research is to present the state of the art of the safety assurance of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems and guidelines on future correlated work. For this purpose, a Systematic Literature Review comprising 5090 peer-reviewed references relating safety to AI has been carried out, with focus on a 329-reference subset in which the safety assurance of AI-based systems is directly conveyed. From 2016 onwards, the safety assurance of AI-based systems has experienced significant effervescence and leaned towards five main approaches: performing black-box testing, using safety envelopes, designing fail-safe AI, combining white-box analyses with explainable AI, and establishing a safety assurance process throughout systems' lifecycles. Each of these approaches has been discussed in this paper, along with their features, pros and cons. Finally, guidelines for future research topics have also been presented. They result from an analysis based on both the cross-fertilization among the reviewed references and the authors' experience with safety and AI. Among 15 research themes, these guidelines reinforce the need for deepening guidelines for the safety assurance of AI-based systems by, e.g., analyzing datasets from a safety perspective, designing explainable AI, setting and justifying AI hyperparameters, and assuring the safety of hardware-implemented AI-based systems.

AB  - In order to gain an in-depth understanding of research about childhood and adolescent depression, this article analyzes the scale, development, and geographic distribution of the literature in the field based on 8491 articles extracted from the Web of Science Core database. Using citation analysis, this article identifies influential journals, scholars, and documents in this field. The study found that in the past 15 years, the number of documents has increased significantly and geographical diversity has also increased. Most of the highly influential literature relates to depression inventories. Using keyword co-occurrence analysis, this article also identified three key research topics focusing on (a) child and adolescent depression symptoms and prevalence, (b) parental depression and child behavioral or emotional problems, and (c) childhood abuse and depression. This study uses ‘science mapping’ as a means to provide a better understanding of research trends about childhood and adolescent depression that have emerged over the past half century, and may serve as reference for future research.

AB  - Online communities are a rapidly growing knowledge repository that provides scholarly research, technical discussion, and social interactivity. This abundance of online information increases the difficulty of keeping up with new developments difficult for researchers and practitioners. Thus, we introduced a novel method that analyses both knowledge and social sentiment within the online community to discover the topical coverage of emerging technology and trace technological trends. The method utilizes the Weibull distribution and Shannon entropy to measure and link social sentiment with technological topics. Based on question-and-answer and social sentiment data from Zhihu, which is an online question and answer (Q&A) community with high-profile entrepreneurs and public intellectuals, we built an undirected weighting network and measured the centrality of nodes for technology identification. An empirical study on artificial intelligence technology trends supported by expert knowledge-based evaluation and cognition provides sufficient evidence of the method's ability to identify technology. We found that the social sentiment of hot technological topics presents a long-tailed distribution statistical pattern. High similarity between the topic popularity and emerging technology development trends appears in the online community. Finally, we discuss the findings in various professional fields that are widely applied to discover and track hot technological topics.

AB  - With the advent of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), services can be registered, invoked, and combined by their identical Quality of Services (QoS) attributes to create a new value-added application that fulfils user requirements.Efficient QoS-aware service composition has been a challenging task in cloud computing.This challenge becomes more formidable in emerging resource-constrained computing paradigms, such as the Internet of Things and Fog.Service composition has regarded as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem that falls in the category of NP-hard.Historically, the proliferation of services added to problem complexity and navigated solutions from exact (none-heuristics) approaches to near-optimal heuristics and metaheuristics.Although metaheuristics have fulfilled some expectations, the quest for finding a high-quality, near-optimal solution has led researchers to devise hybrid methods.As a result, research on service composition shifts towards the hybridization of metaheuristics.Hybrid metaheuristics have been promising efforts to transcend the boundaries of metaheuristics by leveraging the strength of complementary methods to overcome base algorithm shortcomings.Despite the significance and frontier position of hybrid metaheuristics, to the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic research and survey in this field with a particular focus on strategies to hybridize traditional metaheuristics.This study's core contribution is to infer a framework for hybridization strategies by conducting a mapping study that analyses 71 papers between 2008 and 2020.Moreover, it provides a panoramic view of hybrid methods and their experiment setting in respect to the problem domain as the main outcome of this mapping study.Finally, research trends, directions and challenges are discussed to benefit future endeavours.

AB  - Abstract Digitalization and technologization affect numerous domains, promising advantages but also entailing risks. Hence, when decision-makers in highly-regulated domains like Finance implement these technological advances—especially Artificial Intelligence—regulators prescribe high levels of transparency, assuring the traceability of decisions for third parties. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is of tremendous importance in this context. We provide an overview of current research on XAI in Finance with a systematic literature review screening 2,022 articles from leading Finance, Information Systems, and Computer Science outlets. We identify a set of 60 relevant articles, classify them according to the used XAI methods and goals that they aim to achieve, and provide an overview of XAI methods used in different Finance areas. Areas like risk management, portfolio optimization, and applications around the stock market are well-researched, while anti-money laundering is understudied. Researchers implement both transparent models and post-hoc explainability, while they recently favored the latter.

AB  - Abstract Waterlogging in subway stations has a devastating impact on normal operation of important urban facilities and can cause harm to passengers and property. It is difficult to assess the vulnerability of metro stations to waterlogging because many complex factors are involved. This study proposes a hybrid model to assess the vulnerability of subway stations to waterlogging by integrating the entropy weight method (EWM) with a technique for order preference based on similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) (the EWM-TOPSIS method). The model is based on analysis of factors influencing the vulnerability of subway stations to waterlogging. The proposed method was applied to a field case (Jinshahu station in Hangzhou, found to be vulnerable to waterlogging at level IV). The results from EWM-TOPSIS, EWM, and TOPSIS were compared. The results using the EWM-TOPSIS method were more accurate and reliable than those using EWM and TOPSIS. However, the reliability of EWM-TOPSIS was determined based on historical data, which cannot capture rapidly changing factors. Based on the assessment results, recommendations were made to promote the overall health and development of urban areas to satisfy the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG11).

AB  - Knowledge management (KM) comprises several processes, and one of the most important is the knowledge sharing activities. The ability of an organization to manage its organizational knowledge, specifically in the context of knowledge sharing, may enhance the organization’s overall performance. Various approaches and technologies have been introduced to assist the process in achieving that target. Ontology as one of the knowledge representation methods has been becoming popular to assist knowledge sharing in the organization. Previous reviews have mainly focused on general KM issues, with little emphasis on the use of ontology in knowledge sharing. Thus, this article reviews several ontology-based KM tools that can support knowledge-sharing activities to provide some insight into future research in this area. Thirteen ontology-based KM tools were reviewed using ten elements’ comparison criteria: the motivation, domain, source of knowledge, type of knowledge, knowledge extraction, knowledge input process, knowledge retrieval process, knowledge sharing technology, source of ontology component, and ontology methodology. The review found that several elements can be further studied to improve KM implementation in the organization, especially on the knowledge sharing dimension. This includes simplifying the knowledge extraction and retrieval process to explore various knowledge domains from implicit knowledge sources. The review’s outcome also includes proposed components and functions of an ideal ontology-based KM tool.

AB  - Blockchain technology has been changing the nature of several businesses, from supply chain management to electronic record management systems and copyright management to healthcare applications. It provides a resilient and secure platform for modifications due to its distributed and shared nature and cryptographic functions. Each new technology, however, comes with its challenges alongside its opportunities. Previously, we performed a systematic literature review (SLR) to explore how blockchain technology potentially benefits health domain applications. The previous SLR included 27 formal literature papers from 2016 to 2020. Noticing that blockchain technology is rapidly growing, we extended the previous SLR with a multivocal literature review (MLR) approach to present the state of the art in this study. We focused on understanding to what degree blockchain could answer the challenges inherited in the health domain and whether blockchain technology may bring new challenges to health applications. The MLR consists of 78 sources of formal literature and 23 sources of gray literature from 2016 to 2021. As a result of this study, we specified 17 health domain challenges that can be categorized into four groups: (i) meeting regulatory requirements and public health surveillance, (ii) ensuring security and privacy, (iii) ensuring interoperability, and (iv) preventing waste of resources. The analysis shows that blockchain makes significant contributions to the solutions of these challenges. However, 10 new pitfalls come with adopting the technology in the health domain: the inability to delete sensitive data once it is added to a chain, limited ability to keep large-scale data in a blockchain, and performance issues. The data we extracted during the MLR is available in a publicly accessible online repository.

AB  - Paper aims This study reviews the available literature regarding big data analytics applications in supply chain management and provides insight on topics that received a good deal of attention and topics that still require investigation. This review considers the expansion of big data analytics in supply chain management from 2010 to 2019. Originality Beyond displaying the increasing frequency of using big data analytics in supply chain management, the authors also aim to develop a useful categorization of applying business analytics in supply chain management and define opportunities for future research in the field. Research method This paper briefly discusses big data applications in supply chain management. Four common steps in review papers are performed: collecting articles (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), descriptive analysis, defining categories, and evaluating the material. Main findings According to both information technology development trends and the availability of data, more companies are using big data analytics in their supply chains. About 60% of the research on big data applications in supply chain management were published after 2017. These publications have increasingly focused on big data applications in predictive analysis, rather than in the other three types of data analysis: descriptive analysis, diagnostic analysis, and prescriptive analysis. Implications for theory and practice This review shows that the collected data by many companies can be analyzed using big data analytics methods to develop the business growth plan, market direction forecast, manufacturing process simulation, delivery optimization, inventory management, and marketing and sales processes, among many other activities in a supply chain. The number of articles using case studies in the literature is greater than the number of theoretical publications. This shows that big data analytics has now been properly developed for practical applications, rather than just being a theoretical concept.

AB  - The number of cyberattacks on organizations is growing. To increase cyber resilience, organizations need to obtain foresight to anticipate cybersecurity vulnerabilities, developments, and potential threats. This paper describes a tool that combines state of the art text mining and information retrieval techniques to explore the opportunities of using these techniques in the cybersecurity domain. Our tool, the Horizon Scanner, can scrape and store data from websites, blogs and PDF articles, and search a database based on a user query, show textual entities in a graph, and provide and visualize potential trends. The aim of the Horizon Scanner is to help experts explore relevant data sources for potential threats and trends and to speed up the process of foresight. In a requirements session and user evaluation of the tool with cyber experts from the Dutch Defense Cyber Command, we explored whether the Horizon Scanner tool has the potential to fulfill its aim in the cybersecurity domain. Although the overall evaluation of the tool was not as good as expected, some aspects of the tool were found to have added value, providing us with valuable insights into how to design decision support for forecasting analysts.

AB  - Time series forecasting of passenger demand is crucial for optimal planning of limited resources. For smart cities, passenger transport in urban areas is an increasingly important problem, because the construction of infrastructure is not the solution and the use of public transport should be encouraged. One of the most sophisticated techniques for time series forecasting is Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. These deep learning models are very powerful for time series forecasting but are not interpretable by humans (black-box models). Our goal was to develop a predictive and linguistically interpretable model, useful for decision making using large volumes of data from different sources. Our case study was one of the most demanded bus lines of Madrid. We obtained an interpretable model from the LSTM neural network using a surrogate model and the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic model, which improves the linguistic interpretability of the generated Explainable Artificial Intelligent (XAI) model without losing precision.

AB  - The amount of job advertisement data is rapidly growing, and this rich dataset is expected to have implications for the employment market, sector trajectories, and the education sector. Most significantly, human resources (HR) data has never previously been examined with the lens of tech mining for science and technology analyses. This article is the first to examine job advertisement data considering research and development (R&D) progress and requirements, and hereafter, we refer to this as HR mining. The aim of this article is to use HR mining with the purpose of R&D and human capital intelligence using the job advertisement data of Turkey for the 2015-2017 period. The method of this study follows classification as part of the preprocessing step to determine R&D, engineering, and high-tech industry-related job advertisements. Afterward, we use clustering methods to identify areas where key human capital is required, and investments are made by R&D-oriented companies. The results show that it is possible to identify sector-oriented skill requirements and that the significance of the R&D skills varies. For the case of Turkey, we can clearly show the national human capital and R&D by identifying nine key clusters that indicate R&D progress and directions.

AB  - Abstract Scholarly data is growing continuously containing information about the articles from a plethora of venues including conferences, journals, etc. Many initiatives have been taken to make scholarly data available in the form of Knowledge Graphs (KGs). These efforts to standardize these data and make them accessible have also led to many challenges such as exploration of scholarly articles, ambiguous authors, etc. This study more specifically targets the problem of Author Name Disambiguation (AND) on Scholarly KGs and presents a novel framework, Literally Author Name Disambiguation (LAND), which utilizes Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) using multimodal literal information generated from these KGs. This framework is based on three components: (1) multimodal KGEs, (2) a blocking procedure, and finally, (3) hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two newly created KGs: (i) KG containing information from Scientometrics Journal from 1978 onwards (OC-782K), and (ii) a KG extracted from a well-known benchmark for AND provided by AMiner (AMiner-534K). The results show that our proposed architecture outperforms our baselines of 8–14% in terms of F 1 score and shows competitive performances on a challenging benchmark such as AMiner. The code and the datasets are publicly available through Github ( https://github.com/sntcristian/and-kge ) and Zenodo ( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6309855 ) respectively.

AB  - RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) card technology is used for intelligent parking systems. Officers no longer need to record and check manually and repeatedly every vehicle that comes in and out with this system. The system has a weakness, namely if the RFId card is dropped or lost, the person who finds it can use the card. For the purpose of increasing security for users, one of the latest technologies is the use of facial recognition methods. The eigenface algorithm system is an algorithm used for face recognition. The algorithm is used as a training process for the previously inputted employee faces. The results of the training data are stored in a database which is then used as a key to recognize the face of the owner of the motorized vehicle who took the motorcycle. In the trial results of the data application, motorized vehicle owners enter when the facial recognition level is above 70%.

AB  - In the burgeoning field of bitcoin research, a cohesive understanding of how knowledge and insights have evolved over time is lacking. This study aims to address this gap through an exploration of 4123 academic articles pertaining to bitcoin. Utilizing co-word analysis and main path analysis (MPA), it uncovers key themes and seminal works that have substantially influenced the field’s progression. The identified clusters, including safe haven, internet of things (IoT), proof of work (PoW), market efficiency, sentiment analysis, digital currency, and privacy, shed light on the multifaceted discourse surrounding bitcoin. The MPA, incorporating both forward and backward local paths, traces an evolving narrative, starting from an in-depth exploration of bitcoin’s structure, anonymity, and contrasts against traditional financial assets. It tracks the shift in focus to broader market dynamics, volatility, speculative nature, and reactions to economic policy fluctuations. The analysis underscores the transformation of bitcoin research, from its beginnings as a decentralized, privacy-oriented currency to its role in global economics and green financing, revealing a complex narrative of an innovative financial instrument to a multifaceted entity. Implications drawn from this analysis include the need for further research on the potential integration of bitcoin within emerging technologies like AI and cybersecurity, the implications of bitcoin’s interplay with traditional financial systems, and the environmental impacts of bitcoin and blockchain utilization. Overall, the current study not only enhances our understanding of the bitcoin field but also charts its dynamic evolution and stimulates further academic inquiry.

AB  - Abstract Creation and exchange of knowledge depends on collaboration. Recent work has suggested that the emergence of collaboration frequently relies on geographic proximity. However, being co-located tends to be associated with other dimensions of proximity, such as social ties or a shared organizational environment. To account for such factors, multiple dimensions of proximity have been proposed, including cognitive, institutional, organizational, social and geographical proximity. Since they strongly interrelate, disentangling these dimensions and their respective impact on collaboration is challenging. To address this issue, we propose various methods for measuring different dimensions of proximity. We then present an approach to compare and rank them with respect to the extent to which they indicate co-publications and co-inventions. We adapt the HypTrails approach, which was originally developed to explain human navigation, to co-author and co-inventor graphs. We evaluate this approach on a subset of the German research community, specifically academic authors and inventors active in research on artificial intelligence (AI). We find that social proximity and cognitive proximity are more important for the emergence of collaboration than geographic proximity.

AB  - In 1751, Jean le Rond d'Alembert had a dream: "to make a genealogical or encyclopedic tree which will gather the various branches of knowledge together under a single point of view and will serve to indicate their origin and their relationships to one another". In this paper, we address the question identifying the branches of science by taking advantage of the massive digitization of scientific production. In the framework of complex systems studies, we first formalize the notion of level and scale of knowledge dynamics. Then, we demonstrate how we can reconstruct a reasonably precise and concise multi-scale and multi-level approximation of the dynamical structures of Science: phylomemies. We introduce the notion of phylomemetic networks—projections of phylomemies in low dimensional spaces that can be grasped by the human mind—and propose a new algorithm to reconstruct both phylomemies and the associated phylomemetic networks. This algorithm offers, passing, a new temporal clustering on evolving semantic networks. Last, we show how phylomemy reconstruction can take into account users' preferences within the framework of embodied cognition, thus defining a third way between the quest for objective "ground truth" and the ad-hoc adaptation to a particular user's preferences. The robustness of this approach is illustrated by several case studies.

The cohort of scholars studying metaphor in various fields is continuously growing, but very few work has been done in bibliographical analysis of metaphor research. This paper examines the advancements in metaphor research from 2000 to 2017. Using data retrieved from Microsoft Academic Graph and Web of Science, this paper makes a macro analysis of metaphor research, and expounds the underlying patterns of its development. Taking into consideration sub-fields of metaphor research, the internal analysis of metaphor research is carried out from a micro perspective to reveal the evolution of research topics and the inherent relationships among them. This paper provides novel insights into the current state of the art of metaphor research as well as future trends in this field, which may spark new research interests in metaphor from both linguistic and interdisciplinary perspectives.

AB  - The widespread application of artificial intelligence technology in various fields has made the sustainable development of artificial intelligence courses an important direction in the field of artificial intelligence education and teaching. Therefore, it is particularly important to conduct an in-depth analysis of the current research status of “artificial intelligence courses” from a global perspective. Firstly, this article clarifies the three stages of slow development, rapid development, and mature development of artificial intelligence curriculum research through the number and distribution years of the literature. It also conducts a co-authorship analysis on the distribution of countries, institutions, and authors of artificial intelligence curriculum research and identifies countries, institutions, and core authors that have made greater contributions to artificial intelligence curriculum research. Secondly, due to the involvement of artificial intelligence in many different fields of knowledge, an analysis is conducted on the journals that published papers on artificial intelligence courses. Finally, based on the analysis of keyword density and time span, the current research hotspots of artificial intelligence courses are summarized: artificial intelligence technology empowerment courses, two education directions at different stages of artificial intelligence courses, and teaching forms in the field of artificial intelligence courses. The current research trend of artificial intelligence courses is analyzed from three aspects: teaching format, teaching content, and teaching objects. This article provides a theoretical reference value and practical basis for future research and development in the field of artificial intelligence courses, while also providing experience for the efficient and sustainable development of artificial intelligence courses to a certain extent.

AB  - Agriculture research began with the idea that local systems are interconnected. Thus, it was crucial to consider farmers, crops, and livestock. Smart farming arose with the Internet of Things (IoT) as people progressively digitized farming with new information technology. Academic and scientific groups innovate and commercialize IoT-based agricultural products and solutions. Many public and private organizations also explore farming advancements. Therefore, we must stimulate communication and cooperation among the many farming industry actors to build smart agricultural standards and improve system and technology interoperability. The study analyzed 3,229 published articles from smart farming systems in the Scopus database between 2008 and 2022. The collected corpus is preprocessed through various steps, creating a bag of words. Text mining, latent semantic analysis, and network analysis are applied to the collected corpus to provide current research areas based on the key terms. The key terms are taken based on the term frequency-inverse document frequency score. The research was experimented with using KNIME and VOSviewer. Finally, 10 current research areas are provided using K-means clustering for a future researcher for deep insight. This study offered years of analysis, top journals, top authors, and leading countries contributing to smart farming. Research into the myriad issues facing smart farming could begin with these trends. This research helps future researchers understand smart farming and areas that need more attention. It also draws attention to research directions that could use further study.

AB  - Context: The establishment of the Mining Software Repositories (MSR) data showcase conference track has encouraged researchers to provide data sets as a basis for further empirical studies. Objective: Examine the usage of data papers published in the MSR proceedings in terms of use frequency, users, and use purpose. Method: Data track papers were collected from the MSR data showcase track and through the manual inspection of older MSR proceedings. The use of data papers was established through manual citation searching followed by reading the citing studies and dividing them into strong and weak citations. Contrary to weak, strong citations truly use the data set of a data paper. Data papers were then manually clustered based on their content, whereas their strong citations were classified by hand according to the knowledge areas of the Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge. A survey study on 108 authors and users of data papers provided further insights regarding motivation and effort in data paper production, encouraging and discouraging factors in data set use, and future desired direction regarding data papers. Results: We found that 65% of the data papers have been used in other studies, with a long-tail distribution in the number of strong citations. Weak citations to data papers usually refer to them as an example. MSR data papers are cited in total less than other MSR papers. A considerable number of the strong citations stem from the teams that authored the data papers. Publications providing Version Control System (VCS) primary and derived data are the most frequent data papers and the most often strongly cited ones. Enhanced developer data papers are the least common ones, and the second least frequently strongly cited. Data paper authors tend to gather data in the context of other research. [...]

AB  - The rise of software as a research object is mirrored by increasing interests in quantitative studies of scientific software. However, inconsistent citation practices have led most existing studies of this type to base their analysis of software impact on software name mentions, as identified in full-text publications. Despite its limitations, citation data exists in much greater quantities and covers a broader array of scientific fields than full-text data, and thus can support investigations with much wider scope. This paper aims to analyze the extent to which citation data can be used to reconstruct the impact of software. Specifically, we identify the variety of citable objects related to the lme4 R package and examine how the package's impact is dispersed across these objects. Our results shed light on a little-discussed challenge of using citation data to measure software impact: even within the category of formal citation, the same software object might be cited in different forms. We consider the implications of this challenge and propose a method to reconstruct the impact of lme4 through its citations nonetheless.

AB  - Abstract Over the last century, we observe a steady and exponential growth of scientific publications globally. The overwhelming amount of available literature makes a holistic analysis of the research within a field and between fields based on manual inspection impossible. Automatic techniques to support the process of literature review are required to find the epistemic and social patterns that are embedded in scientific publications. In computer sciences, new tools have been developed to deal with large volumes of data. In particular, deep learning techniques open the possibility of automated end-to-end models to project observations to a new, low-dimensional space where the most relevant information of each observation is highlighted. Using deep learning to build new representations of scientific publications is a growing but still emerging field of research. The aim of this paper is to discuss the potential and limits of deep learning for gathering insights about scientific research articles. We focus on document-level embeddings based on the semantic and relational aspects of articles, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We explore the different outcomes generated by those techniques. Our results show that using NLP we can encode a semantic space of articles, while GNN we enable us to build a relational space where the social practices of a research community are also encoded.

AB  - Abstract Background Facing planetary boundaries, we need a sustainable energy system providing its life support function for society in the long-term within environmental limits. Since science plays an important role in decision-making, this study examines the thematic landscape of research on sustainable energy, which may contribute to a sustainability transformation. Understanding the structure of the research field allows for critical reflections and the identification of blind spots for advancing this field. Methods The study applies a text mining approach on 26533 Scopus-indexed abstracts published from 1990 to 2016 based on a latent Dirichlet allocation topic model. Models with up 1100 topics were created. Based on coherence scores and manual inspection, the model with 300 topics was selected. These statistical methods served for highlighting timely topic trends, differing thematic fields, and emerging communities in the topic network. The study critically reflects the quantitative results from a sustainability perspective. Results The study identifies a focus on establishing and optimizing the energy infrastructure towards 100% renewable energies through key modern technology areas: materials science, (biological) process engineering, and (digital) monitoring and control systems. Energy storage, photonic materials, nanomaterials, or biofuels belong to the topics with the strongest trends. The study identifies decreasing trends for general aspects regarding sustainable development and related economic, environmental, and political issues. Conclusions The discourse is latently adopting a technology-oriented paradigm focusing on renewable energy generation and is moving away from the multi-faceted concept of sustainability. The field has the potential to contribute to climate change mitigation by optimizing renewable energy systems. However, given the complexity of these systems, horizontal integration of the various valuable vertical research strands is required. Furthermore, the holistic ecological perspective considering the global scale that has originally motivated research on sustainable energy might be re-strengthened, e.g., by an integrated energy and materials perspective. Beyond considering the physical dimensions of energy systems, existing links from the currently technology-oriented discourse to the social sciences might be strengthened. For establishing sustainable energy systems, future research will not only have to target the technical energy infrastructure but put a stronger focus on issues perceivable from a holistic second-order perspective.

AB  - Background The development of an author-level complementary metric could play a role in the process of academic promotion through objective evaluation of scholars’ influence and impact. Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate the correlation between the Healthcare Social Graph (HSG) score, a novel social media influence and impact metric, and the h-index, a traditional author-level metric. Methods This was a cross-sectional study of health care stakeholders with a social media presence randomly sampled from the Symplur database in May 2020. We performed stratified random sampling to obtain a representative sample with all strata of HSG scores. We manually queried the h-index in two reference-based databases (Scopus and Google Scholar). Continuous features (HSG score and h-index) from the included profiles were summarized as the median and IQR. We calculated the Spearman correlation coefficients (ρ) to evaluate the correlation between the HSG scores and h-indexes obtained from Google Scholar and Scopus. Results A total of 286 (31.2%) of the 917 stakeholders had a Google Scholar h-index available. The median HSG score for these profiles was 61.1 (IQR 48.2), and the median h-index was 14.5 (IQR 26.0). For the 286 subjects with the HSG score and Google Scholar h-index available, the Spearman correlation coefficient ρ was 0.1979 (P&lt;.001), indicating a weak positive correlation between these two metrics. A total of 715 (78%) of 917 stakeholders had a Scopus h-index available. The median HSG score for these profiles was 57.6 (IQR 46.4), and the median h-index was 7 (IQR 16). For the 715 subjects with the HSG score and Scopus h-index available, ρ was 0.2173 (P&lt;.001), also indicating a weak positive correlation. Conclusions We found a weak positive correlation between a novel author-level complementary metric and the h-index. More than a chiasm between traditional citation metrics and novel social media–based metrics, our findings point toward a bridge between the two domains.

AB  - Abstract The primary goal of this article is to identify the research fronts on the application of data-driven methods in business and economics. For this purpose, the research literature of the business and economic sciences Subject Categories from the Web of Science is mapped using BibExcel and VOSviewer. Since the assignment to subject categories is done at the journal level and since a journal is often assigned to several subject categories in Web of Science, two mappings are performed: one without considering multiple assignments (broad view) and one considering only those (articles from) journals that have been assigned exclusively to the business and economic sciences subject categories and no others (narrow view). A further aim of this article is therefore to identify differences in the two mappings. Surprisingly, engineering sciences play a major role in the broad mapping, in addition to the economic sciences. In the narrow mapping, however, only the following clusters with a clear business-management focus emerge: (i) Data-driven methods in management in general and data-driven supply chain management in particular, (ii) Data-driven operations research analyses with different business administration/management focuses, (iii) Data-driven methods and processes in economics and finance, and (iv) Data-driven methods in Information Systems. One limitation of the narrow mapping is that many relevant documents are not covered since the journals in which they appear are assigned to multiple subject categories in WoS. The paper comes to the conclusion that the multiple assignments of subject categories in Web of Science may lead to massive changes in the results. Adjacent subject areas—in this specific case the application of data-driven methods in engineering and more mathematically oriented contributions in economics (econometrics) are considered in the broad mapping (not excluding subject categories from neighbouring disciplines) and are even over-represented compared to the core areas of business and economics. If a mapping should only consider the core aspects of particular research fields, it is shown in this use case that the exclusion of Web of Science-subject categories that do not belong to the core areas due to multiple assignments (narrow view), may be a valuable alternative. Finally, it depends on the reader to decide which mapping is more beneficial to them.

AB  - Currently, the spread of COVID-19 is running at a constant pace. The current situation is not so alarming, but every pandemic has a history of three waves. Two waves have been seen, and now expecting the third wave. Compartmental models are one of the methods that predict the severity of a pandemic. An enhanced SEIR model is expected to predict the new cases of COVID-19. The proposed model has an additional compartment of vaccination. This proposed model is the SEIRV model that predicts the severity of COVID-19 when the population is vaccinated. The proposed model is simulated with three conditions. The first condition is when social distancing is not incorporated, while the second condition is when social distancing is included. The third one condition is when social distancing is combined when the population is vaccinated. The result shows an epidemic growth rate of about 0.06 per day, and the number of infected people doubles every 10.7 days. Still, with imparting social distancing, the proposed model obtained the value of R0 is 1.3. Vaccination of infants and kids will be considered as future work.

The use of the number of citations allows us to predict the qualitative trends on a paper-by-paper basis. At the same time, it is necessary to be able to comprehensively discuss both qualitative and quantitative aspects in the subject area. This study aimed to detect emerging areas in the nanocarbon field using network models and topic models. It was possible to not only construct a model that exceeded an 86.2% F1 measure but also to focus on an area that could not be detected by the prediction model. This was accomplished by focusing on paper units, such as the research on the chemical synthesis of zigzag single-walled carbon nanotubes. Thus, it is possible to obtain knowledge that contributes to diversified R&amp;D strategies and innovation policies by considering the emergence of new fields from multiple perspectives.

AB  - There is an urgent need to improve our understanding of the digital transformation of the construction in order to leverage the benefits of the wider adoption of the Industry 4.0 paradigm. However, there is a lack of systematic research on the digital transformation pathway of the construction industry. In view of this, this study uses the LDA theme model to explore the key influencing factors for the digital transformation of the construction industry and builds a digital comprehensive evaluation system of the construction industry with DEMATEL-ANP. The findings are as follows: Firstly, five elements of the construction industry, such as enterprise resources, enterprise capabilities, enterprise spirit, macro environment and industry environment, have an important impact on the digital transformation of the construction industry. Secondly, the ability of construction enterprises has the most significant influence on the digital transformation of the construction industry. This empirical study provides policy suggestions and an implementation framework for realizing high-quality development of the construction industry based on digital technological innovation. The study helps construction enterprises to understand the necessity of digital transformation and provides a theoretical basis and practical ideas for construction enterprises to formulate their own digital transformation strategies.

AB  - Abstract This paper outlines new perspectives for data‐supported foresight by combining participatory expert‐based futures dialogues with the power of artificial intelligence (AI) in what we call the hybrid AI‐expert‐based foresight approach. To this end, we present a framework of five typical steps in a fully fledged foresight process ranging from scoping to strategizing and show how AI can be integrated into each of the steps to enable the hybrid AI‐expert foresight approach. Building on this, we present experiences gained from two recent research projects of TNO and Fraunhofer ISI that deal with aspects of the hybrid AI‐expert foresight approach and give insights into the opportunities and challenges of the new perspectives for data‐supported foresight that this approach enables. Finally, we summarize open questions and challenges for future research.

AB  - Summary Cloud computing has grown to become a popular distributed computing service offered by commercial providers. More recently, edge and fog computing resources have emerged on the wide‐area network as part of Internet of things (IoT) deployments. These three resource abstraction layers are complementary, and offer distinctive benefits. Scheduling applications on clouds has been an active area of research, with workflow and data flow models offering a flexible abstraction to specify applications for execution. However, the application programming and scheduling models for edge and fog are still maturing, and can benefit from learnings on cloud resources. At the same time, there is also value in using these resources cohesively for application execution. In this article, we offer a taxonomy of concepts essential for specifying and solving the problem of scheduling applications on edge, fog, and cloud computing resources. We first characterize the resource capabilities and limitations of these infrastructure and offer a taxonomy of application models, quality‐of‐service constraints and goals, and scheduling techniques, based on a literature review. We also tabulate key research prototypes and papers using this taxonomy. This survey benefits developers and researchers on these distributed resources in designing and categorizing their applications, selecting the relevant computing abstraction(s), and developing or selecting the appropriate scheduling algorithm. It also highlights gaps in literature where open problems remain.

AB  - Cross-laminated timber (CLT) has been one of the principal materials in mass timber construction, and now it is possible to find mid-rise and high-rise projects around the globe. This study makes a scientometric review comparison between CLT and the impact of the fourth industrial revolution (formally known as Industry 4.0) in the construction industry, focusing on worldwide academic publications between 2006 and 2022. The analysis considers keywords, co-author, co-citation, and clustering analysis. This study used 1320 documents, including journals and conference proceedings from the Scopus database, where 753 were for cross-laminated timber and 567 for Industry 4.0. Key researchers, research institutions, journals, publications, citation patterns, and trends are some of the results obtained from the scientometric analysis. Once the knowledge mapping was conducted for both fields, scrutiny of the interconnection of both areas was performed to find possible research gaps from a manufacturing perspective. Among the conclusions, it is logical to say that Industry 4.0 implementation in cross-laminated timber is still in its infancy. One of the most popular technologies impacting construction is the digital twin concept; however, no work is reported for CLT on this topic. Additionally, digital automation is a necessity in any research practice, and the use of industrial robots is shown to be an essential asset for CLT as these robots can handle complex shapes.

AB  - The spread of ransomware has risen exponentially over the past decade, causing huge financial damage to multiple organizations. Various anti-ransomware firms have suggested methods for preventing malware threats. The growing pace, scale and sophistication of malware provide the anti-malware industry with more challenges. Recent literature indicates that academics and anti-virus organizations have begun to use artificial learning as well as fundamental modeling techniques for the research and identification of malware. Orthodox signature-based anti-virus programs struggle to identify unfamiliar malware and track new forms of malware. In this study, a malware evaluation framework focused on machine learning was adopted that consists of several modules: dataset compiling in two separate classes (malicious and benign software), file disassembly, data processing, decision making, and updated malware identification. The data processing module uses grey images, functions for importing and Opcode n-gram to remove malware functionality. The decision making module detects malware and recognizes suspected malware. Different classifiers were considered in the research methodology for the detection and classification of malware. Its effectiveness was validated on the basis of the accuracy of the complete process.

AB  - Background With the rapid development of online health communities, increasing numbers of patients and families are seeking health information on the internet. Objective This study aimed to discuss how to fully reveal the health information needs expressed by patients with hypertension in their questions in a web-based environment and how to use the internet to help patients with hypertension receive personalized health education. Methods This study randomly selected 1000 text records from the question data of patients with hypertension from 2008 to 2018 collected from Good Doctor Online and constructed a classification system through literature research and content analysis. This paper identified the background characteristics and questioning intention of each patient with hypertension based on the patient’s question and used co-occurrence network analysis and the k-means clustering method to explore the features of the health information needs of patients with hypertension. Results The classification system for the health information needs of patients with hypertension included the following nine dimensions: drugs (355 names), symptoms and signs (395 names), tests and examinations (545 names), demographic data (526 kinds), diseases (80 names), risk factors (37 names), emotions (43 kinds), lifestyles (6 kinds), and questions (49 kinds). There were several characteristics of the explored web-based health information needs of patients with hypertension. First, more than 49% of patients described features, such as drugs, symptoms and signs, tests and examinations, demographic data, and diseases. Second, patients with hypertension were most concerned about treatment (778/1000, 77.80%), followed by diagnosis (323/1000, 32.30%). Third, 65.80% (658/1000) of patients asked physicians several questions at the same time. Moreover, 28.30% (283/1000) of patients were very concerned about how to adjust the medication, and they asked other treatment-related questions at the same time, including drug side effects, whether to take the drugs, how to treat the disease, etc. Furthermore, 17.60% (176/1000) of patients consulted physicians about the causes of clinical findings, including the relationship between the clinical findings and a disease, the treatment of a disease, and medications and examinations. Fourth, by k-means clustering, the questioning intentions of patients with hypertension were classified into the following seven categories: “how to adjust medication,” “what to do,” “how to treat,” “phenomenon explanation,” “test and examination,” “disease diagnosis,” and “disease prognosis.” Conclusions In a web-based environment, the health information needs expressed by Chinese patients with hypertension to physicians are common and distinct, that is, patients with different background features ask relatively common questions to physicians. The classification system constructed in this study can provide guidance to health information service providers for the construction of web-based health resources, as well as guidance for patient education, which could help solve the problem of information asymmetry in communication between physicians and patients.

AB  - The Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies and techniques have been used to solve a wide spectrum of engineering problems in Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry with the aim of improving overall productivity and optimized decision throughout full project life cycle (planning, design, construction and maintenance). However, many AI applications are facing different limitations and constrains due to the lack of comprehensive understanding about the inherent uncertainty fundamentally and mathematically, hence the use of AI has not achieved a satisfactory level. It requires different actions to tackle different types of uncertainties which varies according to different types of applications. This paper therefore reviews 5 type of popular AI algorithms, including Primary Component Analysis, Multilayer Perceptron, Fuzzy Logic, Support Vector Machine and Genetic Algorithm; then examines how these artificial intelligence techniques can assist the decision-making process by mitigating uncertainty meanwhile achieving the expected high efficiency. The paper reviews each germane technique, mathematical explanation, analysis of reasons causing uncertainty, and concludes a set of guidelines and an application framework for optimizing their informed uncertainty for AEC applications. This work will pave the way for the fundamental understanding and in turn to provide a valuable reference for applying AI techniques in AEC sector properly to achieve better overall performance.

AB  - Subject categorization of scientific publications, i.e., journals, book series or conference proceedings, has become a main concern in academia, as publication impact and ranking are considered a basic criterion to evaluate paper quality. Publishers usually propose their own categorization, but they often include only their own publications and their categories might not be coherent with other proposals. Also, due to the dynamic nature of science, new categories may frequently appear. As traditional mechanisms for categorization have been questioned by many authors, a new research line has emerged to improve the category assignment process. Approaches usually rely on assessing publication similarity in terms of topics, co-citation, editorial boards, and/or shared author profiles. In this work, we propose a novel procedure for scientific publication hierarchical categorization based on the repetition or absence of relevant descriptors in association rules among publications. The key idea is that publication categories can be automatically defined by strong associations of nuclear topics. Also, some very specific subcategories can be defined by exclusion from any set of rules. This process can be used to construct a data-driven hierarchy of scientific publication categories from scratch or to improve any existing categorization by discovering new fields. In this paper the proposed algorithm uses SJR descriptors all journals in the SCImago dataset and the three-level classification in the Scopus dataset (covering only 35 % of publications of the SCImago dataset) to discover new categories and assign every journal to the resulting enhanced hierarchy one. We have focused on the field of “Physical Sciences and Engineering”, using the SCImago and Scopus datasets from 2019 (30,883 scientific publications). Our procedure combines data engineering techniques with association rules and generates as a result potential new categories and outlier subcategories. To evaluate the suitability of our proposal, we have analyzed classification results based on the original category list and our extended two-level categorization via the Jensen–Shannon divergence and supervised machine-learning techniques. Results reveal the consistency and suitability of our categorization procedure.

AB  - International Management is a vast and multidisciplinary research domain that is heavily influenced by several other disciplines, such as Economics, Organizational Theory and Strategic Management. Based on 28,973 research articles, this study aims to analyze the knowledge structure of the international management domain from 1920 to 2019. Using computational text-based topic modeling analysis, we trace the evolution of international management knowledge by examining the major academic topics/latent themes discussed in the field. The study also diachronically visualizes the variations in topic prevalence over time. Our methodology is akin to "inductive mapping" as it is neither biased by our position nor it is guided by assumptions related to the topics we expect to find. Results indicate the existence of a wide variety of important research foci in the domain of international management. These include, among others, strategic alliances formation, international entry modes, corporate social responsibility, cross-cultural consumer behavior, technological innovation and entrepreneurship. Results also show that some topics such as "financial risk and return on investment" and "corporate social responsibility" show a declining time trend, indicating that academic research focusing on such topics was more likely to be published early on and less so recently. On the other hand, other topics such as "Emerging (East) Asian nations" and "global mergers and acquisitions" show an increasing trend, indicating that more papers were published recently. Taken together, although our findings might reflect the breadth and depth of research in international management, they might also suggest that the bounds of this field are not well defined.

AB  - In the era of big data, the advancement, improvement, and application of algorithms in academic research have played an important role in promoting the development of different disciplines. Academic papers in various disciplines, especially computer science, contain a large number of algorithms. Identifying the algorithms from the full-text content of papers can determine popular or classical algorithms in a specific field and help scholars gain a comprehensive understanding of the algorithms and even the field. To this end, this article takes the field of natural language processing (NLP) as an example and identifies algorithms from academic papers in the field. A dictionary of algorithms is constructed by manually annotating the contents of papers, and sentences containing algorithms in the dictionary are extracted through dictionary-based matching. The number of articles mentioning an algorithm is used as an indicator to analyze the influence of that algorithm. Our results reveal the algorithm with the highest influence in NLP papers and show that classification algorithms represent the largest proportion among the high-impact algorithms. In addition, the evolution of the influence of algorithms reflects the changes in research tasks and topics in the field, and the changes in the influence of different algorithms show different trends. As a preliminary exploration, this paper conducts an analysis of the impact of algorithms mentioned in the academic text, and the results can be used as training data for the automatic extraction of large-scale algorithms in the future. The methodology in this paper is domain-independent and can be applied to other domains.

AB  - Stress has been designated the "Health Epidemic of the 21st Century" by the World Health Organization and negatively affects the quality of individuals' lives by detracting most body systems. In today's world, different methods are used to track and measure various types of stress. Among these techniques, experience sampling is a unique method for studying everyday stress, which can affect employees' performance and even their health by threatening them emotionally and physically. The main advantage of experience sampling is that evaluating instantaneous experiences causes less memory bias than traditional retroactive measures. Further, it allows the exploration of temporal relationships in subjective experiences. The objective of this paper is to structure, analyze, and characterize the state of the art of available literature in the field of surveillance of work stress via the experience sampling method. We used the formal research methodology of systematic mapping to conduct a breadth-first review. We found 358 papers between 2010 and 2021 that are classified with respect to focus, research type, and contribution type. The resulting research landscape summarizes the opportunities and challenges of utilizing the experience sampling method on stress detection for practitioners and academics.

AB  - Objective: In recent years, citation analysis tools provide many devices for finding or computing the citation score or impact factor for journals. It is important for the researchers to identify good journals for collecting research ideas discussed. A journal with a good impact factor value is preferably referred to by many researchers. In this research work, the author proposes a system for ranking journals on the basis of ideas and results cited in other papers. Methods: The work involves the cited content extractor for extracting the descriptive features mentioned about the cited paper. The cited content refers to the content in the article written by a citing paper and relating to the cited paper. The ranking system uses a citation score estimator for computing the overall weight of the descriptive cited content relating to a specific paper in the citing papers. The journal ranking system performs classification of the citation content with the evaluation of a citation score. The work that involves the citation content is classified under different categories as positively cited, negatively cited or neutral and unrelated. Results: Then the computed citation score is used for ranking the dealing with research on cancer research journals. The results of the ranking journals indicate that the particular ranked journal has been cited in the literature of many journals with a good descriptive content. Journal ranking system can be considered as a well-organized tool for ranking the cancer research scientific journal based on citation content and citation counting. Conclusion: This experimental cancer journal ranking method increases accuracy and effectiveness by using the citation content when compared with PageRank and HITS.

AB  - Many researchers insist that computational methods will transform the historical profession, while an equally large number reject these claims as unwarranted hype. This study attempts to place the debate in historical and social context. The essay is divided into three parts. The first part offers a brief review of computational history. It asks whether the “computational turn” bears any resemblance to quantitative history and how it fits within the digital humanities. The second part describes the authors’ recent attempts to apply computational methods to an existing project in the history of science using a standardized workflow. It demonstrates that each step of the workflow adds another layer of subjectivity. The third part reflects on what computational methods mean for the historical profession. It systematically reviews the positive aspects of computational history (open access, interdisciplinary collaboration, and new perspectives) as well as the negative aspects (inequality, fragility, and the threat of automation) and offers prescriptions based on the authors’ experiences.

AB  - Abstract Enhancing decision-making under risks is crucial in various fields, and three-way decision (3WD) methods have been extensively utilized and proven to be effective in numerous scenarios. However, traditional methods may not be sufficient when addressing intricate decision-making scenarios characterized by uncertain and ambiguous information. In response to this challenge, the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) theory extends the conventional fuzzy set theory by introducing two pivotal concepts, i.e., membership degrees and non-membership degrees. These concepts offer a more comprehensive means of portraying the relationship between elements and fuzzy concepts, thereby boosting the ability to model complex problems. The generalized IFS theory brings about heightened flexibility and precision in problem-solving, allowing for a more thorough and accurate description of intricate phenomena. Consequently, the generalized IFS theory emerges as a more refined tool for articulating fuzzy phenomena. The paper offers a thorough review of the research advancements made in 3WD methods within the context of generalized intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) environments. First, the paper summarizes fundamental aspects of 3WD methods and the IFS theory. Second, the paper discusses the latest development trends, including the application of these methods in new fields and the development of new hybrid methods. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of research methods employed in recent years. While these methods have yielded impressive outcomes in decision-making, there are still some limitations and challenges that need to be addressed. Finally, the paper proposes key challenges and future research directions. Overall, the paper offers a comprehensive and insightful review of the latest research progress on 3WD methods in generalized IF environments, which can provide guidance for scholars and engineers in the intelligent decision-making field with situations characterized by various uncertainties.

AB  - Early detection of emerging research trends could potentially revolutionise the way research is done. For this reason, trend analysis has become an area of paramount importance in academia and industry. This is due to the significant implications for research funding and public policy. The literature presents several emerging approaches to detecting new research trends. Most of these approaches rely mainly on citation counting. While citations have been widely used as indicators of emerging research topics, they suffer from some limitations. For instance, citations can take months to years to progress and then to reveal trends. Furthermore, they fail to dig into paper content. To overcome this problem, we introduce Leap2Trend, a novel approach to instant detection of research trends. Leap2Trend relies on temporal word embeddings (word2vec) to track the dynamics of similarities between pairs of keywords, their rankings and respective uprankings (ascents) over time. We applied Leap2Trend to two scientific corpora on different research areas, namely computer science and bioinformatics and we evaluated it against two gold standards Google Trends hits and Google Scholar citations. The obtained results reveal the effectiveness of our approach to detect trends with more than 80% accuracy and 90% precision in some cases. Such significant findings evidence the utility of our Leap2Trend approach for tracking and detecting emerging research trends instantly.

AB  - We describe Cartolabe, a web-based multiscale system for visualizing and exploring large textual corpora based on topics, introducing a novel mechanism for the progressive visualization of filtering queries. Initially designed to represent and navigate through scientific publications in different disciplines, Cartolabe has evolved to become a generic framework and accommodate various corpora, ranging from Wikipedia (4.5M entries) to the French National Debate (4.3M entries). Cartolabe is made of two modules: The first relies on natural language processing methods, converting a corpus and its entities (documents, authors, and concepts) into high-dimensional vectors, computing their projection on the two-dimensional plane, and extracting meaningful labels for regions of the plane. The second module is a web-based visualization, displaying tiles computed from the multidimensional projection of the corpus using the Umap projection method. This visualization module aims at enabling users with no expertise in visualization and data analysis to get an overview of their corpus, and to interact with it: exploring, querying, filtering, panning, and zooming on regions of semantic interest. Three use cases are discussed to illustrate Cartolabe's versatility and ability to bring large-scale textual corpus visualization and exploration to a wide audience.

AB  - Human, animal, and environmental health are increasingly threatened by the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. Inappropriate use of antibiotic treatments commonly contributes to this threat, but it is also becoming apparent that multiple, interconnected environmental factors can play a significant role. Thus, a One Health approach is required for a comprehensive understanding of the environmental dimensions of antibiotic resistance and inform science-based decisions and actions. The broad and multidisciplinary nature of the problem poses several open questions drawing upon a wide heterogeneous range of studies. This study seeks to collect and catalogue the evidence of the potential effects of environmental factors on the abundance or detection of antibiotic resistance determinants in the outdoor environment, i.e., antibiotic resistant bacteria and mobile genetic elements carrying antibiotic resistance genes, and the effect on those caused by local environmental conditions of either natural or anthropogenic origin. Here, we describe the protocol for a systematic evidence map to address this, which will be performed in adherence to best practice guidelines. We will search the literature from 1990 to present, using the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Web of Science Core Collection as well as the grey literature. We shall include full-text, scientific articles published in English. Reviewers will work in pairs to screen title, abstract and keywords first and then full-text documents. Data extraction will adhere to a code book purposely designed. Risk of bias assessment will not be conducted as part of this SEM. We will combine tables, graphs, and other suitable visualisation techniques to compile a database i) of studies investigating the factors associated with the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in the environment and ii) map the distribution, network, cross-disciplinarity, impact and trends in the literature.

AB  - The study aimed to identify the core defining dimensions and descriptors of Competitive Intelligence (CI) to provide a unified view and approach. The authors used a mixed-methods approach to derive meta-inferences from the sequential integration of quantitative and qualitative methods. Five defining core dimensions and one hundred descriptors, twenty for each dimension, were identified. The integrated dimensions provide a consistent definition and understanding of CI. More precise definitions result from cascading down the meaning of the dimensions into the descriptors, from complex to simple concepts. Grouping the descriptors allows for more concise explanations without loss of precision. A unified definition establishes the body of knowledge of the discipline and advances business and science. It also supports the establishment of the CI profession and professional identity and serves as a guide for the effective establishment of the CI function. The development of CI theory has a significant impact on CI culture and may enable the society to address one of the greatest current challenges, information overload. CI education can only thrive if a clear definition and understanding is possible.

AB  - Address matching continues to play a central role at various levels, through geocoding and data integration from different sources, with a view to promote activities such as urban planning, location-based services, and the construction of databases like those used in census operations. However, the task of address matching continues to face several challenges, such as non-standard or incomplete address records or addresses written in more complex languages. In order to better understand how current limitations can be overcome, this paper conducted a systematic literature review focused on automated approaches to address matching and their evolution across time. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed, resulting in a final set of 41 papers published between 2002 and 2021, the great majority of which are after 2017, with Chinese authors leading the way. The main findings revealed a consistent move from more traditional approaches to deep learning methods based on semantics, encoder-decoder architectures, and attention mechanisms, as well as the very recent adoption of hybrid approaches making an increased use of spatial constraints and entities. The adoption of evolutionary-based approaches and privacy preserving methods stand as some of the research gaps to address in future studies.

AB  - Abstract Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, a large number of relevant articles have been published or become available in preprint servers. These articles, along with earlier related literature, compose a valuable knowledge base affecting contemporary research studies or even government actions to limit the spread of the disease, and directing treatment decisions taken by physicians. However, the number of such articles is increasing at an intense rate, making the exploration of the relevant literature and the identification of useful knowledge challenging. In this work, we describe BIP4COVID19, an open data set that offers a variety of impact measures for coronavirus-related scientific articles. These measures can be exploited for the creation or extension of added-value services aiming to facilitate the exploration of the respective literature, alleviating the aforementioned issue. In the same context, as a use case, we provide a publicly accessible keyword-based search interface for COVID-19-related articles, which leverages our data to rank search results according to the calculated impact indicators.

AB  - Abstract Interest in change propagation analysis for engineering design has increased rapidly since the topic gained prominence in the late 1990s. Although there are now many approaches and models, there is a smaller number of underlying key concepts. This article contributes a literature review and organising framework that summarises and relates these key concepts. Approaches that have been taken to address each key concept are collected and discussed. A visual analysis of the literature is presented to uncover some trends and gaps. The article thereby provides a thematic analysis of state-of-the-art in design change propagation analysis, and highlights opportunities for further work.

AB  - The growth of renewable energy actively takes part in decarbonizing the fossil-fuel-based energy system. It reduces carbon emissions, carbon footprint, and greenhouse gas emissions and increases clean energy. The usage of renewable resources reduces and solves several problems, such as increasing temperature, carbon footprint, greenhouse gas emissions, and energy waste. Every sector contributes to increasing the above-mentioned factors in the environment. One of the main reasons for this biodegradation and climate change is energy resources. Using renewable energy instead of fossil fuel can solve the problem. This paper aims to find open research problems about the application of renewable energy and to initiate new innovative ideas regarding renewable energy. A detailed state of the art includes trends for renewable energy resources, their theoretical evolution, and practical implementations. Methodologies used for decision analysis in renewable energy are discussed in detail. The time frame for this analysis of renewable energy is 2010 to &gt;2022. An extensive literature review finds a huge research scope in applying renewable energy in other research, such as logistics, smart production management, and advanced inventory management. Then, major changes in the profit/cost of that system due to renewable energy can be analyzed. This research proposes some innovative new ideas related cost formulas for renewable energy for the corresponding open problems.

AB  - The influence of the Rescorla-Wagner model cannot be overestimated, despite that (1) the model does not differ much computationally from its predecessors and competitors, and (2) its shortcomings are well-known in the learning community. Here we discuss the reasons behind its widespread influence in the cognitive and neural sciences, and argue that it is the constant search for general-process theories by learning scholars which eventually produced a model whose application spans many different areas of research to this day. We focus on the theoretical and empirical background of the model, the theoretical connections that it has with later developments across Marr's levels of analysis, as well as the broad variety of research that it has guided and inspired.

AB  - Purpose The digital construction transformation requires using emerging digital technology such as deep learning to automate implementing tasks. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the current state of using deep learning in the construction management tasks to enable researchers to determine the capabilities of current solutions, as well as finding research gaps to carry out more research to bridge revealed knowledge and practice gaps. Design/methodology/approach The scientometric analysis is conducted for 181 articles to assess the density of publications in different topics of deep learning-based construction management applications. After that, a thematic and gap analysis are conducted to analyze contributions and limitations of key published articles in each area of application. Findings The scientometric analysis indicates that there are four main applications of deep learning in construction management, namely, automating progress monitoring, automating safety warning for workers, managing construction equipment, integrating Internet of things with deep learning to automatically collect data from the site. The thematic and gap analysis refers to many successful cases of using deep learning in automating site management tasks; however, more validations are recommended to test developed solutions, as well as additional research is required to consider practitioners and workers perspectives to implement existing applications in their daily tasks. Practical implications This paper enables researchers to directly find the research gaps in the existing solutions and develop more workable applications to bridge revealed gaps. Accordingly, this will be reflected on speeding the digital construction transformation, which is a strategy over the world. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first of its kind to adopt a structured technique to assess deep learning-based construction site management applications to enable researcher/practitioners to either adopting these applications in their projects or conducting further research to extend existing solutions and bridging revealed knowledge gaps.

AB  - Information Technology (IT) has revolutionized the way we manage our money. The adoption of innovative technologies in banking scenarios allows to access old and new financial services but in a faster and more secure, comfortable, rewarding and engaging way. The number, the performances and the seamless integration of these innovations is a driver for banks to retain their customers and avoid costly change of hearts. The literature is rich in works reporting on the use of technology with direct or indirect impact on the experience of banking customers. Some mapping studies about the adoption of technologies in the field exist, but they are specific to particular technologies (e.g. only Artificial Intelligence), or vice versa too generic (e.g. reviewing the adoption of technologies to support any kind of banking process). So a specific research effort on the crossed domain of technology and Customer Experience (CX) is missing. This paper aims to overcome the following gaps: the lack of a comprehensive map of the research made in the field in the past decade; a discussion on the current research trends of top publications and journals is missing; the next research challenges are yet to be identified. To face these limitations, we designed and submitted 7 different queries to pull papers out of 4 popular scientific databases. From an initial set of 6,756 results, we identified a set of 89 primary studies that we thoroughly analyzed. A selection of the top 20% works allowed us to seek the most performant technologies as well as other promising ones that have not been experimented yet in the field. Main results prove that the combined study of technology and CX in the banking sector is not approached systematically and thus the development of a new specific research line is needed.

AB  - With the wide use of web technologies, service-oriented architecture (SOA), and cloud computing, more and more geographical information systems are served as GIServices. Under such circumstance, quality of geographic information services (QoGIS) has emerged as an important research topic of geoinformatics. However, it is not easy to understand the field since QoGIS has no formal standards, which is not only in regard to server-side performance and capabilities, but is also related with the quality of experience (QoE) during user interaction with GIServices. In this paper, we compare quality of service (QoS) and QoGIS research to understand the uniqueness of QoGIS. A conceptual framework is proposed to organize and interpret QoGIS research from the perspective of quality modeling, acquisition, and application, and we discuss the status, limitations, and future directions of this area. Overall, our analysis shows that new quality metrics will evolve from existing metrics to match the needs in concrete QoGIS applications, and user preferences need to be considered in quality modeling for GIServices. We discuss three approaches for the provision of QoGIS information and find that user feedback mining is an important supplementary source of quality information. Gaps between QoS and QoGIS research suggest that the GIService performance enhancement must not only consider the unique features of spatial data models and algorithms, but also system architecture, deployment, and user spatiotemporal access behaviors. Advanced service selection algorithms must be introduced to tackle the quality optimization problems of geoprocessing workflow planning. Moreover, a QoGIS-aware GIServices framework must be established to facilitate and ensure GISerivce discovery and interaction. We believe this bibliographic review provides a helpful guide for GIS researchers.

AB  - Predicting the output of research grants is of considerable relevance to research funding bodies, scientific entities and government agencies. In this study, we investigate whether text features extracted from projects title and abstracts are able to identify productive grants. Our analysis was conducted in three distinct areas, namely Medicine, Dentistry and Veterinary Medicine. Topical and complexity text features were used to identify predictors of productivity. The results indicate that there is a statistically significant relationship between text features and grants productivity, however such a dependence is weak. A feature relevance analysis revealed that the abstract text length and metrics derived from lexical diversity are among the most discriminative features. We also found that the prediction accuracy has a dependence on the considered project language and that topical features are more discriminative than text complexity measurements. Our findings suggest that text features should be used in combination with other features to assist the identification of relevant research ideas.

It also considers what has changed, most notably the unrelenting pace of increases in the capacity of computer technology as expressed in Moore’s Law. It considers the fundamental shift libraries need to make from an outside-in to an inside-out approach and how this requires investing in open content and infrastructure. Finally, a challenge was issued to the group to create the open scholarly commons for theology and religion.

AB  - Abstract The science of science has attracted growing research interests, partly due to the increasing availability of large-scale datasets capturing the innerworkings of science. These datasets, and the numerous linkages among them, enable researchers to ask a range of fascinating questions about how science works and where innovation occurs. Yet as datasets grow, it becomes increasingly difficult to track available sources and linkages across datasets. Here we present SciSciNet, a large-scale open data lake for the science of science research, covering over 134M scientific publications and millions of external linkages to funding and public uses. We offer detailed documentation of pre-processing steps and analytical choices in constructing the data lake. We further supplement the data lake by computing frequently used measures in the literature, illustrating how researchers may contribute collectively to enriching the data lake. Overall, this data lake serves as an initial but useful resource for the field, by lowering the barrier to entry, reducing duplication of efforts in data processing and measurements, improving the robustness and replicability of empirical claims, and broadening the diversity and representation of ideas in the field.

AB  - Abstract The concept of a circular economy is at a crossroads. To date, it has been largely driven by top-down national or trans-national legislation such as EU Circular Economy Package or Chinese Circular Economy Promotion. Bottom-up or grassroots engagement has been minimal and innovation has been largely restricted to use of 3R or 4R frameworks to reduce, reuse, recycle materials and products or recover waste as energy. Greater implementation of a circular economy needs a paradigm shift in public attitudes coupled with greater innovation that moves from 3R to 9R framework. Building on the insights gained from the successful transition of two Scandinavian cities of Växjö and Sønderborg to becoming fossil fuel-free economies, the article explores use of natural language processing tools to create shared narratives and stories from large format public engagement that expresses common interests, values and priorities that in turn can contribute to a participatory design of a circular economy. The article uses published data from Christchurch ‘Share an Idea’ as a case study.

AB  - Abstract The rapidly growing research landscape in finance, encompassing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) topics and associated Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, presents challenges for both new researchers and seasoned practitioners. This study aims to systematically map the research area, identify knowledge gaps, and examine potential research areas for researchers and practitioners. The investigation focuses on three primary research questions: the main research themes concerning ESG and AI in finance, the evolution of research intensity and interest in these areas, and the application and evolution of AI techniques specifically in research studies within the ESG and AI in finance domain. Eight archetypical research domains were identified: (i) Trading and Investment, (ii) ESG Disclosure, Measurement and Governance, (iii) Firm Governance, (iv) Financial Markets and Instruments, (v) Risk Management, (vi) Forecasting and Valuation, (vii) Data, and (viii) Responsible Use of AI. Distinctive AI techniques were found to be employed across these archetypes. The study contributes to consolidating knowledge on the intersection of ESG, AI, and finance, offering an ontological inquiry and key takeaways for practitioners and researchers. Important insights include the popularity and crowding of the Trading and Investment domain, the growth potential of the Data archetype, and the high potential of Responsible Use of AI, despite its low publication count. By understanding the nuances of different research archetypes, researchers and practitioners can better navigate this complex landscape and contribute to a more sustainable and responsible financial sector.

AB  - Purpose: The TBA in the primary industry sector is to organize the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural extraction activities. The primary sector is heavily reliant on natural resources and environmental conditions, and TBA can help businesses in this sector make data-driven decisions to optimize their operations and reduce their environmental impact. For example, TBA can help agricultural businesses optimize their crop yields by analysing data from weather sensors, soil sensors, and other sources. By using predictive analytics, businesses can anticipate weather patterns and adjust their planting schedules and crop management practices accordingly. This can lead to higher crop yields, improved resource utilization, and reduced environmental impact. Similarly, TBA can help natural resource extraction businesses optimize their operations by analysing data from sensors, drones, and other sources. By using advanced analytics techniques, businesses can identify opportunities to improve resource utilization, reduce waste, and minimize the impact of their activities on the environment. Hence, the primary industry sector faces many challenges, including climate change, resource depletion, and environmental degradation. By using TBA, businesses in this sector can make data-driven decisions to improve their operations, reduce their environmental impact, and ensure the long-term sustainability of their activities. Design/Methodology/Approach: The TBA in primary industry sector involves a combination of data collection, analysis, and interpretation techniques. The specific methodology used will depend on the industry and the specific business objectives. Hence, the TBA methodology for the primary industry sector is focused on using data-driven insights to improve efficiency, productivity, and sustainability. By collecting and analysing data from various sources, businesses in this sector can make informed decisions that lead to improved outcomes for both the business and the environment. Findings/Result: It is discussed in the paper how Tech Business Analytics in the Primary industry sector will have managed the growth itself from its evolution to till date. Originality/Value: An explanation of how Tech Business Analytics in the Primary industry sector differs from business analytics. A generic architecture is also available, which looks at 30 recently presented TBA in Primary industry sector research proposals and is useful for technical purposes.

AB  - Rainfall interception is of great significance to the fully utilization of rainfall in water limited areas. Until now, studies on rainfall partitioning process of typical ecosystems in Heihe River Basin, one of the most important inland river basins in China, is still insufficient. In this study, six typical ecosystems were selected, namely alpine meadow, coniferous forest, mountain steppe, desert, cultivated crop, and riparian forest, in Heihe River Basin for investigation of the rainfall interception characteristics and their influencing factors, including rainfall amount, duration, and intensity, based on the gross rainfall and high temporal resolution soil moisture data obtained from 12 automatic observation sites. The results show that the average interception amount and average interception rate of the six ecosystems are significantly different: alpine meadow 6.2 mm and 45.9%, coniferous forest 7.4 mm and 69.1%, mountain steppe 3.5 mm and 37.3%, desert 3.5 mm and 57.2%, cultivated crop 4.5 mm and 69.1%, and riparian forest 2.6 mm and 66.7%, respectively. The rainfall amount, duration, and intensity all had impact on the process of rainfall interception. Among these three factors, the impact of rainfall amount was most significant. The responses of these ecosystems to the rainfall characteristics were also different. Analyzing rainfall interception with high temporal resolution soil moisture data is proved to be a feasible method and need further development in the future.

AB  - In the last few years, chatbots have become mainstream solutions adopted in a variety of domains for automatizing communication at scale. In the same period, knowledge graphs have attracted significant attention from business and academia as robust and scalable representations of information. In the scientific and academic research domain, they are increasingly used to illustrate the relevant actors (e.g., researchers, institutions), documents (e.g., articles, patents), entities (e.g., concepts, innovations), and other related information. Following the same direction, this paper describes how to integrate conversational agents with knowledge graphs focused on the scholarly domain, a.k.a. Scientific Knowledge Graphs. On top of the proposed architecture, we developed AIDA-Bot, a simple chatbot that leverages a large-scale knowledge graph of scholarly data. AIDA-Bot can answer natural language questions about scientific articles, research concepts, researchers, institutions, and research venues. We have developed four prototypes of AIDA-Bot on Alexa products, web browsers, Telegram clients, and humanoid robots. We performed a user study evaluation with 15 domain experts showing a high level of interest and engagement with the proposed agent.

AB  - Social science concerns issues on individuals, relationships, and the whole society. The complexity of research topics in social science makes it the amalgamation of multiple disciplines, such as economics, political science, and sociology, etc. For centuries, scientists have conducted many studies to understand the mechanisms of the society. However, due to the limitations of traditional research methods, there exist many critical social issues to be explored. To solve those issues, computational social science emerges due to the rapid advancements of computation technologies and the profound studies on social science. With the aids of the advanced research techniques, various kinds of data from diverse areas can be acquired nowadays, and they can help us look into social problems with a new eye. As a result, utilizing various data to reveal issues derived from computational social science area has attracted more and more attentions. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we present a survey on data-driven computational social science for the first time which primarily focuses on reviewing application domains involving human dynamics. The state-of-the-art research on human dynamics is reviewed from three aspects: individuals, relationships, and collectives. Specifically, the research methodologies used to address research challenges in aforementioned application domains are summarized. In addition, some important open challenges with respect to both emerging research topics and research methods are discussed.

AB  - Satisfying the world’s rapidly increasing demands in energy via the optimized management of available resources is becoming one of the most important research trends worldwide. When it comes to energy, it is very important to talk about decentralization, security, traceability and transparency. Thus, over the last few years, numerous research works have presented blockchain technology as the best novel business platform enabling a secure, transparent and tamper-proof energy management solution. In this paper, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) using the PRISMA framework of the different existing research studies related to the use of the blockchain technology in the energy sector, published between 2008 and 2021. We identified a total of 769 primary studies after intensive manual analysis and filtering, which we thoroughly assessed using various criteria to address six main research questions that covered the blockchain types, applications and platforms in the energy sector, the energy source types for which blockchain platforms are implemented, the emergent technologies that are combined to blockchain solutions, and the types of consensuses used in energy blockchains. Based on the collected survey data, we built a database to categorize the existing research works, identify research trends, and highlight knowledge gaps and potential areas for additional field study.

AB  - ACII is the premier international forum for presenting the latest research on affective computing. In this work, we monitor, quantify and reflect on the diversity in ACII conference across time by computing a set of indexes. We measure diversity in terms of gender, geographic location and academia vs research centres vs industry, and consider three different actors: authors, keynote speakers and organizers. Results raise awareness on the limited diversity in the field, in all studied facets, and compared to other AI conferences. While gender diversity is relatively high, equality is far from being reached. The community is dominated by European, Asian and North American researchers, leading the rest of continents under-represented. There is also a strong absence of companies and research centres focusing on applied research and products. This study fosters discussion in the community on the need for diversity and related challenges in terms of minimizing potential biases of the developed systems to the represented groups. We intend our paper to contribute with a first analysis to consider as a monitoring tool when implementing diversity initiatives. The data collected for this study are publicly released through the European divinAI initiative.

AB  - Precision medicine (PM) is playing a more and more important role in clinical practice. In recent years, the scale of PM research has been growing rapidly. Many reviews have been published to facilitate a better understanding of the status of PM research. However, there is still a lack of research on the intellectual structure in terms of topics.This study aimed to identify the intellectual structure and evolutionary trends of PM research through the application of various social network analysis and visualization methods.The bibliographies of papers published between 2009 and 2018 were extracted from the Web of Science database. Based on the statistics of keywords in the papers, a coword network was generated and used to calculate network indicators of both the entire network and local networks. Communities were then detected to identify subdirections of PM research. Topological maps of networks, including networks between communities and within each community, were drawn to reveal the correlation structure. An evolutionary graph and a strategic graph were finally produced to reveal research venation and trends in discipline communities.The results showed that PM research involves extensive themes and, overall, is not balanced. A minority of themes with a high frequency and network indicators, such as Biomarkers, Genomics, Cancer, Therapy, Genetics, Drug, Target Therapy, Pharmacogenomics, Pharmacogenetics, and Molecular, can be considered the core areas of PM research. However, there were five balanced theme directions with distinguished status and tendencies: Cancer, Biomarkers, Genomics, Drug, and Therapy. These were shown to be the main branches that were both focused and well developed. Therapy, though, was shown to be isolated and undeveloped.The hotspots, structures, evolutions, and development trends of PM research in the past ten years were revealed using social network analysis and visualization. In general, PM research is unbalanced, but its subdirections are balanced. The clear evolutionary and developmental trend indicates that PM research has matured in recent years. The implications of this study involving PM research will provide reasonable and effective support for researchers, funders, policymakers, and clinicians.

AB  - Identifying technology trends can be a key success factor for companies to be competitive and take advantage of technological trends before they occur. The companies always work to plan for future products and services. For that, it is important to turn to methods that are used for technology forecasting. These tools help the companies to define potential markets for innovative new products and services. This paper uses text mining techniques along with expert judgment to detect and analyze the near-term technology evolution trends in a Software as a Service (SaaS) case study. The longer-term technology development trend in this case is forecasted by analyzing the gaps between science and technology. This paper contributes to the technology forecasting methodology and will be of interest to those in SaaS technology. Our findings reveal five trends in the technology: 1) virtual networking, 2) the hybrid cloud, 3) modeling methodologies, 4) mobile applications, and 5) web applications. Among the results achieved, we can summarize the interesting ones as follows: it is possible to say that traditional information systems are now evolving into online information systems. On the other hand, the use of a licensing model based on subscriptions triggers the change in perpetual licensing models. The product range that has evolved towards mobile technologies has put pressure on information storage technologies and has led to the search for new methods especially in the development of database systems.

Extant research remains unspecific about the distinct contribution that Operational Research can make in environments that are influenced by big data, data science and analytics. This paper explores the possibility that these environments hold the potential for a new integrative Operational Research offering, which we conceptualise as Smart Operational Research. In developing this proposal, we combine automated co-occurrence analysis of a corpus of literature with human-driven data interpretation to identify instantiations of hybrid decision-making. We then bring theory and practice together to outline the Smart Operational Research framework with the overall aim to enhance actionable insight and positive results for Operational Research practitioners.

AB  - Pain is a significant public health problem as the number of individuals with a history of pain globally keeps growing. In response, many synergistic research areas have been coming together to address pain-related issues. This work reviews and analyzes a vast body of pain-related literature using the keyword co-occurrence network (KCN) methodology. In this method, a set of KCNs is constructed by treating keywords as nodes and the co-occurrence of keywords as links between the nodes. Since keywords represent the knowledge components of research articles, analysis of KCNs will reveal the knowledge structure and research trends in the literature. This study extracted and analyzed keywords from 264,560 pain-related research articles indexed in IEEE, PubMed, Engineering Village, and Web of Science published between 2002 and 2021. We observed rapid growth in pain literature in the last two decades: the number of articles has grown nearly threefold, and the number of keywords has grown by a factor of 7. We identified emerging and declining research trends in sensors/methods, biomedical, and treatment tracks. We also extracted the most frequently co-occurring keyword pairs and clusters to help researchers recognize the synergies among different pain-related topics.

AB  - Abstract Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most momentous technologies of our time. Thus, it is of major importance to know which stakeholders influence AI research. Besides researchers at universities and colleges, researchers in companies have hardly been considered in this context. In this article, we consider how the influence of companies on AI research can be made measurable on the basis of scientific publishing activities. We compare academic- and company-authored AI publications published in the last decade and use scientometric data from multiple scholarly databases to look for differences across these groups and to disclose the top contributing organizations. While the vast majority of publications is still produced by academia, we find that the citation count an individual publication receives is significantly higher when it is (co–)authored by a company. Furthermore, using a variety of altmetric indicators, we notice that publications with company participation receive considerably more attention online. Finally, we place our analysis results in a broader context and present targeted recommendations to safeguard a harmonious balance between academia and industry in the realm of AI research.

In this context, Pearl's framework based on causal graphical models is an approach that has recently gained popularity and allows for explicit reasoning about issues related to spurious correlations. Our primary goal is to understand to which extend and how Pearl's graphical framework is applied in software engineering (SE). We performed a systematic mapping study and analysed a total of 25 papers published between 2010 and 2022. Our results show that the application of Pearl's SCI framework in SE is relatively recent and that the corresponding research community is fragmented. Most of the selected papers focus on software quality analysis. There is no clear and widespread community of practice (yet) on how to implement and evaluate SCI in SE. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time such a mapping study is done. We believe that SE practitioners might benefit from such a work, as it both provides an overview of the work and people involved in the application of causal inference methods, but also outlines the potential and limitations of such approaches.

AB  - Abstract Inventory control is one of the key areas of research in logistics. Using the SCOPUS database, we have processed 9,829 articles on inventory control using triangulation of statistical methods and machine learning. We have proven the usefulness of the proposed statistical method and Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture for determining trend-setting keywords in inventory control research. We have demonstrated the changes in the research conducted between 1950 and 2021 by presenting the evolution of keywords in articles. A novelty of our research is the applied approach to bibliometric analysis using unsupervised deep learning. It allows to identify the keywords that determined the high citation rate of the article. The theoretical framework for the intellectual structure of research proposed in the studies on inventory control is general and can be applied to any area of knowledge.

AB  - Lubrication and cooling (LC) are critical for mechanical devices’ effective and dependable functioning, because they decrease friction and wear of moving components, ensuring superior efficiency. However, the cutting fluids in machining operations are a key cause of fear, due to their high cost, environmental impact, and health risks, particularly in computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools (MTs). During the industrial revolutions, MTs superseded manual labour and increased efficiency and output. Therefore, much research was conducted on lubrication and cooling in CNC machine tools (LC in CNC MTs). Therefore, it has become necessary to review and highlight research hotspots and gaps using specific means that can benefit budding researchers. The present review aims to identify research hotspots and gaps of LC in CNC MTs utilizing content and visualization analysis, employing VOSviewer and Biblioshiny software. The analysis comprises 136 documents retrieved by Scopus between 1988 and 2022. The analysis revealed a consistent growth in publications, primarily consisting of articles, with a minor proportion of review documents and conference papers. The keywords were categorized into seven clusters, with a notable prevalence of ‘surface roughness’ and ‘CNC machine tools’. A word cloud was generated to visualize the author’s frequently used keywords, where larger font sizes represented higher frequency. The treemaps demonstrated that ‘CNC’ appeared 34 times and contributed 8%, followed by ‘machine’, ‘tool’, ‘machining’, and ‘thermal’. In the abstract-terms tree plot, ‘machine’ appeared 235 times and contributed 7%, followed by ‘CNC’, ‘machining’, ‘tool’, and ‘cutting’. The content and visualization analysis identified six research hotspots: computer control systems, machine tools, computer numerical control, machining, numerical control systems, and surface roughness (Ra). The research gaps are temperature, cooling systems, cutting forces, energy utilization, tool life, nanoparticles, electric power utilization, and energy conservation. Based on hotspots and gaps, literature evaluations extensively addressed the strong roadmap of technical improvements and problems of LC in CNC MTs. A complete visualization and content analysis also produced a conceptual framework for best practices, and the study offers insight into the issues and prospects.

AB  - Introduction The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in postharvest agriculture has significantly improved in recent decades, thanks to extensive scientific research. The study aimed to identify research gaps and hotspots for future research based on keyword co-occurrence and clustering analyses, as well as to discuss the results and highlight the research trends. Methods This study analyses research trends in AI application in postharvest agriculture using novel scientometric tools such as the Bibliometrix R package, biblioshiny, and VosViewer. The research analysed 586 published papers on AI application in postharvest agriculture research between 1994 and September 2022, retrieved from the Scopus database. Results and discussion The results showed that publications on AI applications in postharvest agriculture research have been increasing for almost 30 years, with significant growth in the subject area in the last decade. China, the USA, and India were found to be the top three most productive countries, accounting for 52.4%, 22%, and 18.6% of the total selected publications, respectively. The analysis also revealed that topics such as the Internet of Things, cold chain logistics, big data, decision-making, and real-time monitoring have low development degrees in the knowledge domain. This study demonstrated increased research on AI applications in postharvest agriculture, aiming to reduce postharvest losses, enhance food nutrition and quality, and mitigate food insecurity. It also provides valuable scientific references on AI applications in postharvest agriculture research for researchers and scholars. By identifying research gaps and hotspots, this study can guide future research in AI applications in postharvest agriculture to further improve the industry.

AB  - Service innovation emerged more than a decade ago and is considered as the main source of competitive advantage between the market and firms. Due to the growing attention to service innovation in recent years, this study investigates the phenomenon of service innovation in greater depth to understand how service innovation has emerged, evolved, and how it will potentially advance. Considering a systematic investigation, the foundational research areas and historical development of service innovation are explored by conducting a comprehensive performance analysis (qualitative and quantitative) employing 255 articles published in two periods between 1970 and 2021. The results revealed four distinguishable clusters with each showing different characteristics of the service innovation domain including: resource focus, process focus, solution focus, and actors' focus. In particular, we analyse which research streams are related to service innovation and compare these themes over time. The findings show that the major themes in the first period (1992–2014) included innovation, customer, service, and product, while the second period (2014–2021) encompassed service, customer, value, and information as the main themes. This paper supports the assertion that service innovation has an interdisciplinary theoretical foundation and that the structure of the foundation of service innovation research changed significantly over time.

AB  - Currently, artificial intelligence (AI) is at the center of academic and public debate. However, its implications on politics remain little understood. To understand the impact of the AI phenomenon on politics of the European Union (EU), we have carried out qualitative multimethod research by performing a systematic literature review and a case study. The first method was performed according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA), in order to report the state-of-the-art in the existing literature and explore the most relevant research areas. The second method contained contributions from experts in data science and AI of the Portuguese scientific community. The results showed that solutions such as intelligent decision support systems are improving the political decision-making process and impacting the Portuguese society at local, regional, and national levels. We also found that practitioners and scientists are currently shifting their interests from environmental and biological sciences to healthcare services, which is bringing new challenges in terms of protecting patient/citizen data and growing concerns about handling of critical information. Future research may focus on comparative studies with other EU States to obtain a comprehensive and holistic understanding of the AI phenomenon.

AB  - Advances in the field of machine learning (ML) have been reflected in the intensity of research studies exploiting these techniques for a better understanding of existing phenomena, and for predicting future ones, as a mean for promoting a more efficient and sustainable transportation system. The present study aims to understand the trends of utilizing diverse ML approaches to tackle issues within sub-domains of transportation and to identify underutilized potentials among them. This paper presents a methodology for the bi-dimensional classification of a large corpus of scientific articles. The articles are classified into six transport-related sub-domains, based on the definition of the Israeli Smart Transport Research Center, whose aim is a transportation system with zero externalities, and the ML techniques used in each of them is identified. A fuzzy KNN model is implemented for the multi-classification of articles into the transportation sub-domains and an ontology-based reasoning for identifying the share of each applied ML approach is employed. The application of these methodologies to a corpus of 1718 articles revealed, among other findings, an increasing share of artificial neural networks and deep learning techniques from 2018 until 2022, particularly in the traffic management sub-domain. A significant contribution of the development of these automatic methodologies is the ability to reuse them for ongoing exploration of trends regarding the use of ML techniques for transportation sub-domains.

AB  - Evaluating the long-term influence of academic papers in the early stage after publication is crucial for research management and decision-making.Although the total number of citations has been considered as a valid indicator to measure the academic influence of papers, there are still some bottleneck problems in predicting future citation counts.Firstly, it remains a challenging task to select the reasonable features due to the diversity of model features.Secondly, some prediction models are overly complex and their defects may cause prediction bias or even errors.Finally, the most important thing is that very few models possess long-term predictive ability.This paper proposes a prediction model that can provide an early evaluation of the long-term citations, or the long-term influence, of academic papers.The model uses features available immediately after publication or after a certain period of time.Taking academic papers in Information Science and Library Science as our experimental subject, we train the model using three machine learning algorithms and find that the artificial neural network performs satisfactorily.Our findings may offer guidance for research management and decision-making.

AB  - Construction Engineering and Management (CEM) is a broad domain with publications covering interrelated subdisciplines and considered a key source of knowledge sharing. Previous studies used scientometric methods to assess the current impact of CEM publications; however, there is a need to predict future citations of CEM publications to identify the expected high-impact trends in the future and guide new research efforts. To tackle this gap in the literature, the authors conducted a study using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and Social Network Analysis (SNA) to predict CEM-related citation metrics. Using a dataset of 93,868 publications, the authors trained and tested two machine learning classification algorithms: Random Forest and XGBoost. Validation of the RF and XGBoost resulted in a balanced accuracy of 79.1% and 79.5%, respectively. Accordingly, XGBoost was selected. Testing of the XGBoost model revealed a balanced accuracy of 80.71%. Using SNA, it was found that while the top CEM subdisciplines in terms of the number of predicted impactful papers are “Project planning and design”, “Organizational issues”, and “Information technologies, robotics, and automation”; the lowest was “Legal and contractual issues”. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by studying the citation level, strength, and interconnectivity between CEM subdisciplines as well as identifying areas more likely to result in highly cited publications.

AB  - With the aid of technology advancement, the field of education has seen a noticeable transformation. The teaching-learning process is now more interactive and is no longer restricted to students&amp;#39; physical presence in the classroom but instead makes use of specialized online platforms. In recent years, solutions that offer learning routes customized to learners&amp;#39; needs have become more necessary. In this regard, artificial intelligence has served as an excellent answer, allowing for the building of educational systems that can accommodate a wide range of student needs. Through this paper, a systematic mapping of the literature on AI-based adaptive learning is presented. The examination of 93 articles published between 2000 and 2022 made it possible to draw several conclusions, including the number of adaptive learning environments based on AI, the types of AI algorithms used, the objectives targeted by these systems as well as factors related to adaptation. This study may serve as a springboard for further investigation into how to address the problems raised by the current state.&amp;nbsp;

AB  - Thanks to smart grids, more intelligent devices may now be integrated into the electric grid, which increases the robustness and resilience of the system. The integration of distributed energy resources is expected to require extensive use of communication systems as well as a variety of interconnected technologies for monitoring, protection, and control. The fault location and diagnosis are essential for the security and well-coordinated operation of these systems since there is also greater risk and different paths for a fault or contingency in the system. Considering smart distribution systems, microgrids, and smart automation substations, a full investigation of fault location in SGs over the distribution domain is still not enough, and this study proposes to analyze the fault location issues and common types of power failures in most of their physical components and communication infrastructure. In addition, we explore several fault location techniques in the smart grid’s distribution sector as well as fault location methods recommended to improve resilience, which will aid readers in choosing methods for their own research. Finally, conclusions are given after discussing the trends in fault location and detection techniques.

AB  - Abstract Studites on traffic management is crucial for the development of intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. However, identifying the development stages of traffic management field based on bibliometric analysis is still lacking. In this study, CiteSpace and VOSviewer software are used to explore “traffic management” field by summarizing development process and predicting future research trend. A total of 3,028 relevant documents over the past 40 years were collected from Web of Science. Results show that (1) studies on traffic management were mainly published by researchers from USA (30.55%), China (20.90%), and some European countries; (2) the key traffic management research contents can be classified into four categories, that is, background requirements, traffic problems, method models, and control strategies; (3) the evolution process can be divided into four stages, that is, budding stage (1990–1994), development stage (1995–2003), calm stage (2004–2010), and maturation stage (2011–); (4) machine learning, deep learning and other intelligent algorithms have played more important roles in recent years, and connected vehicle management is also a potential development trend. Results suggest that cooperative vehicle‐infrastructure systems or machine learning‐based studies might be the hotspots on traffic management studies.

AB  - Abstract Disambiguation of authors in digital libraries is essential for many tasks, including efficient bibliographical searches and scientometric analyses to the level of individuals. The question of how to link documents written by the same person has been given much attention by academic publishers and information retrieval researchers alike. Usual approaches rely on publications’ metadata such as affiliations, email addresses, co-authors, or scholarly topics. Lack of homogeneity in the structure of bibliographic collections and discipline-specific dissimilarities between them make the creation of general-purpose disambiguators arduous. We present an algorithm to disambiguate authorships in the Astrophysics Data System (ADS) following an established semi-supervised approach of training a classifier on authorship pairs and clustering the resulting graphs. Due to the lack of high-signal features such as email addresses and citations, we engineer additional content- and location-based features via text embeddings and named-entity recognition. We train various nonlinear tree-based classifiers and detect communities from the resulting weighted graphs through label propagation, a fast yet efficient algorithm that requires no tuning. The resulting procedure reaches reasonable complexity and offers possibilities for interpretation. We apply our method to the creation of author entities in a recent ADS snapshot. The algorithm is evaluated on 39 manually-labeled author blocks comprising 9545 authorships from 562 author profiles. Our best approach utilizes the Random Forest classifier and yields a micro- and macro-averaged BCubed $$\mathrm {F}_1$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>F</mml:mi> <mml:mn>1</mml:mn> </mml:msub> </mml:math> score of 0.95 and 0.87, respectively. We release our code and labeled data publicly to foster the development of further disambiguation procedures for ADS.

In this paper, we present the results of three analyses that we conducted to explore the application of GIS in these domains. The analysis includes a case study to test the feasibility of providing GIS services through an application developed with open-source tools. The first section presents the results from a scoping review looking at the current GIS practices in the public health and food safety domains as found in scientific literature. The second section shares the findings from a visual exploration of the use of GIS by EU agencies and supra-national bodies in the public health and food safety domains. The third section presents the current scenario of GIS used at the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA), which was tracked with an internal survey circulated among EFSA's scientific community. Alongside the three analyses, we look at current practices in terms of 1) fields in which GIS is used, 2) the infrastructure used for GIS, 3) GIS data, and 4) the methodology used for data collection, processing and analysis. The results show that GIS is used in multiple fields related to public health and food safety, such as epidemiology, plant health, animal health, and agriculture. We conclude that despite facing challenges regarding data quality issues, legal implications, and technical limitations, GIS has great potential given its relevance to the current environmental and health crises: such a holistic approach is in line with the One Health concept supported by EFSA and different European and international institutions. Moreover, GIS facilitates transition from control to prevention thanks to its capacity to develop spatial models that move from description to prediction. Finally, GIS facilitates communication, which guides better policy making. References Agyeman PC, Ahado SK, Boruvka L, Biney JKM, Sarkodie VYO, Kebonye NM and Kingsley J, 2021.

AB  - From the perspective of historical review, the methodology of economics develops from qualitative to quantitative, from a small sampling of data to a vast amount of data. Because of the superiority in learning inherent law and representative level, deep learning models assist in realizing intelligent decision-making in economics. After presenting some statistical results of relevant researches, this paper systematically investigates deep learning in economics, including a survey of frequently-used deep learning models in economics, several applications of deep learning models used in economics. Then, some critical reviews of deep learning in economics are provided, including models and applications, why and how to implement deep learning in economics, research gap and future challenges, respectively. It is obvious that several deep learning models and their variants have been widely applied in different subfields of economics, e.g., financial economics, macroeconomics and monetary economics, agricultural and natural resource economics, industrial organization, urban, rural, regional, real estate and transportation economics, health, education and welfare, business administration and microeconomics, etc. We are very confident that decision-making in economics will be more intelligent with the development of deep learning, because the research of deep learning in economics has become a hot and important topic recently.

AB  - Currently, studies involving a digital twin are gaining widespread interest.While the first fields adopting such a concept were in manufacturing and engineering, lately, interest extends also beyond these fields across all academic disciplines.Given the inviting idea behind a digital twin which allows the efficient exploitation and utilization of simulations such a trend is understandable.The purpose of this paper is to use a scientometrics approach to study the early publication history of the digital twin across academia.Our analysis is based on large-scale bibliographic and citation data from Scopus that provides authoritative information about high-quality publications in essentially all fields of science, engineering and humanities.This paper has four major objectives.First, we obtain a global overview of all publications related to a digital twin across all major subject areas.This analysis provides insights into the structure of the entire publication corpus.Second, we investigate the co-occurrence of subject areas appearing together on publications.This reveals interdisciplinary relations of the publications and identifies the most collaborative fields.Third, we conduct a trend and keyword analysis to gain insights into the evolution of the concept and the importance of keywords.Fourth, based on results from topic modeling using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model we introduce the definition of a scientometric dimension (SD) of digital twin research that allows to summarize an important aspect of the bound diversity of the academic literature.

AB  - During the development of rural settlements, the loss of distinctive rural characteristics, caused by the contradiction between urban expansion and the ideal of pastoralism, has attracted widespread attention from researchers worldwide. To effectively understand the development and trends of the Research of Features and Characteristics of Rural Settlements (abbreviated as RFCRS), this paper uses the knowledge mapping software CiteSpace to conduct co-citation analysis, research collaboration analysis, keyword clustering, and keyword co-occurrence. The study analyzes the basic concepts, the literature distribution characteristics, research clusters, key issues, and development trends of RFCRS. The research found that the current key issues in RFCRS include “Eco-logical services and environmental protection of rural settlements”, “Sustainable planning and architectural design issues of rural settlements”, and “Human settlement environment and service facility construction of rural settlements”. This paper predicts that future RFCRS research trends will focus on the study of landscape features and characteristics based on ecology, climate, and aesthetics; study of architectural features and characteristics based on characteristic factors and hierarchical structure; and research on rural revitalization based on sustainable development principles. The paper also offers four priority research suggestions for researchers from different disciplines.

AB  - Numerous studies on fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) have been conducted in the past two decades. We aimed to assess the research trends and hotspots in the field of FMT through a quantitative method.The clinical studies of FMT published from 2001 to 2021 were extracted from the Web of Science database. We analyzed the countries, institutions, authors, and keywords of these articles and visually illustrated using VOSviewer and CiteSpace software. The current application of FMT in clinical practice, including indications, efficacy, adverse events, as well as its methodology, such as donor, delivery route, were also evaluated.A total of 227 records were finally identified. The number and rate of annual publications increased gradually. The USA ranked highest in the number of publications. Harvard University was the most influential institution, and Digestive Diseases and Sciences was the most productive journal. Kassam Zain published the most papers, and the high-frequency keywords were mainly related to diseases and techniques. Healthy donors were the most widely used donors, and frozen stool had the highest frequency of use. The predominant delivery route was endoscopy followed by oral capsules and enema. FMT was most frequently performed for the treatment of recurrent Clostridium Difficile Infection. The overall efficacy of FMT was 76.88%, and the incidence of minor and severe adverse events were 11.63% and 1.59%, respectively.This study delineated a comprehensive landscape of the advancement in FMT field. Although in its infancy, FMT is a burgeoning option for the treatment of a variety of diseases associated with gut dysbiosis. To improve the efficacy and reduce adverse events, future studies are warranted to optimize the methodology of FMT.

AB  - Even though computer science (CS) has had a historical lack of gender and race representation, its AI research affects everybody eventually. Being partially rooted in CS conferences, "AI ethics" (AIE) conferences such as FAccT and AIES have quickly become distinct venues where AI's societal implications are discussed and solutions proposed. However, it is largely unknown if these conferences improve upon the historical representational issues of traditional CS venues. In this work, we explore AIE conferences' evolution and compare them across demographic characteristics, publication content, and citation patterns. We find that AIE conferences have increased their internal topical diversity and impact on other CS conferences. Importantly, AIE conferences are highly differentiable, covering topics not represented in other venues. However, and perhaps contrary to the field's aspirations, white authors are more common while seniority and black researchers are represented similarly to CS venues. Our results suggest that AIE conferences could increase efforts to attract more diverse authors, especially considering their sizable roots in CS.

AB  - Online and in the real world, communities are bonded together by emotional consensus around core issues. Emotional responses to scientific findings often play a pivotal role in these core issues. When there is too much diversity of opinion on topics of science, emotions flare up and give rise to conflict. This conflict threatens positive outcomes for research. Emotions have the power to shape how people process new information. They can color the public's understanding of science, motivate policy positions, even change lives. And yet little work has been done to evaluate the public's emotional response to science using quantitative methods. In this paper, we use a dataset of responses to scholarly articles on Facebook to analyze the dynamics of emotional valence, intensity, and diversity. We present a novel way of weighting click-based reactions that increases their comprehensibility, and use these weighted reactions to develop new metrics of aggregate emotional responses. We use our metrics along with LDA topic models and statistical testing to investigate how users' emotional responses differ from one scientific topic to another. We find that research articles related to gender, genetics, or agricultural/environmental sciences elicit significantly different emotional responses from users than other research topics. We also find that there is generally a positive response to scientific research on Facebook, and that articles generating a positive emotional response are more likely to be widely shared---a conclusion that contradicts previous studies of other social media platforms.

AB  - This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on cybersecurity in the automotive industry. Using the R tool Bibliometrix, a total of 537 papers related to cybersecurity and the automotive industry were analyzed. First, our paper contributes to academia by showing that research on this topic is grouped into four clusters that correspond to four lines of research: Automotive Security; Vehicle Engineering; Smart Vehicle; IT Security. Second, our paper contributes to the literature by highlighting the existing gaps. On the subject of standards and framework, there are gaps in terms of what the security requirements must be for the vehicle. This is very important since, given the heterogeneity of technology that vehicles from different manufacturers have, the cybersecurity requirements are different. Additionally, a gap can also be observed in the literature on the supply chain, which has a very small number of papers. In general, they do not cover or elaborate on the supply chain security, when, from a manufacturing point of view, it is very important to manage an effective cybersecurity strategy for the vehicles. Moreover, our paper also contributes to managers and policy-makers' understanding of cybersecurity. We show that adequate implementation of cybersecurity in the automotive must involve a multidimensional perspective. First, it should be a multistage model, ranging from the first stages of design in interconnection with the suppliers to the final stages of use by the customer. Second, it should be a multi-level model, as a consequence of the interconnection of the vehicle's control systems. Finally, the model should be multi-feedback, structuring the process design as a feedback system, including incident response, diagnosis services and vehicle updates.

AB  - The growing importance of maturity smart cities is currently observed worldwide. The vast majority of smart city models focus on hard domains such as communication and technology infrastructure. Scientists emphasize the need to take into account social capital and the knowledge of residents. The smart cities invest in enhanced openness and transparency data. Mature smart cities use real-time evidences and information to citizens, businesses and visitors. The smart cities are characterized by bottom-down management and civil government. The paper aims to assess the urban smartness of selected European cities based on the ISO 37120 standard. Several research methods including the Multidimensional Statistical Analysis (MSA) were applied. Using the statistical analysis of European smart cities with the implemented ISO 37120 standard, the author tried to fill gaps in the knowledge and to evaluate maturity smart cities. The results of the research have shown that the smart city concept is a viable strategy which contributes to the urban sustainability. The author also found out that urban sustainability frameworks contain a large number of indicators measuring environmental sustainability, the smart city frameworks lack environmental indicators while highlighting social and economic aspects.

AB  - Introduction Air pollution exposure has influenced a broad range of mental health conditions. It has attracted research from multiple disciplines such as biomedical sciences, epidemiology, neurological science, and social science due to its importance for public health, with implications for environmental policies. Establishing and identifying the causal and moderator effects is challenging and is particularly concerning considering the different mental health measurements, study designs and data collection strategies (eg, surveys, interviews) in different disciplines. This has created a fragmented research landscape which hinders efforts to integrate key insights from different niches, and makes it difficult to identify current research trends and gaps. Method and analysis This systematic map will follow the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence’s guidelines and standards and Reporting Standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses guidelines. Different databases and relevant web-based search engines will be used to collect the relevant literature. The time period of search strategies is conducted from the inception of the database until November 2022. Citation tracing and backward references snowballing will be used to identify additional studies. Data will be extracted by combining of literature mining and manual correction. Data coding for each article will be completed by two independent reviewers and conflicts will be reconciled between them. Machine learning technology will be applied throughout the systematic mapping process. Literature mining will rapidly screen and code the numerous available articles, enabling the breadth and diversity of the expanding literature base to be considered. The systematic map output will be provided as a publicly available database. Ethics and dissemination Primary data will not be collected and ethical approval is not required in this study. The findings of this study will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed scientific journal and academic conference presentations.

AB  - Abstract The scope, complexity and the “volume” of knowledge accumulated render producing an overview of the core themes of science, technology and innovation policies difficult. Reviews of this policy domain mostly either refer to general issues without deep immersion into details or focus on specific narrower aspects. The paper uses semantic analysis to identify major themes of science, technology and innovation policies over the last three decades and to trace their evolution towards current policy setting. We use semantic tools for processing and analysing documents produced by one of the major and highly reputable international expert bodies, the OECD Working Party on Technology and Innovation Policy. We show that selected themes remain in the mainstream even though being affected by regular policy adjustments and refinements and which disappear or appear with new challenges and expected solutions. Other themes appear niche or exotic themes which are under discussion for some time only.

AB  - Image captioning has gradually gained attention in the field of artificial intelligence and become an interesting and challenging task for image understanding. It needs to identify important objects in images, extract attributes, tell relationships, and help the machine generate human-like descriptions. Recent works in deep neural networks have greatly improved the performance of image caption models. However, machines are still unable to imitate the way humans think, talk and communicate, so image captioning remains an ongoing task. It is thus very important to keep up with the latest research and results in the field of image captioning whereas publications on this topic are numerous. Our work aims to help researchers to have a macro-level understanding of image captioning from four aspects: spatial-temporal distribution characteristics, collaborative networks, trends in subject research, and historical evolutionary path. We employ scientometric visualization methods to achieve this goal. The results show that China has published the largest amount of publications in image captioning, but the United States has the greatest impact on research in this area. Besides, thirteen academic groups are identified in the field of image description, with institutions such as Microsoft, Google, Australian National University, and Georgia Institute of Technology being the most prominent research institutions. Meanwhile, we find that evaluation methods, datasets, novel image captioning models based on generative adversarial networks, reinforcement learning, and Transformer, as well as remote sensing image captioning, are the new research trends. Lastly, we conclude that image captioning research has gone through three major development stages from 2010 to 2020, and on this basis, we propose a more comprehensive taxonomy of image captioning.

AB  - With the rapid progress of network technologies and sensors, monitoring the sensor data such as pressure, temperature, current, vibration and other electrical, mechanical and chemical variables has become much more significant. With the arrival of Big Data and artificial intelligence (AI), sophisticated solutions can be developed to prevent failures and predict the equipment’s remaining useful life (RUL). These techniques allow for taking maintenance actions with haste and precision. Accordingly, this study provides a systematic literature review (SLR) of the predictive maintenance (PdM) techniques in transportation systems. The main focus of this study is the literature covering PdM in the motor vehicles’ industry in the last 5 years. A total of 52 studies were included in the SLR and examined in detail within the scope of our research questions. We provided a summary on statistical, stochastic and AI approaches for PdM applications and their goals, methods, findings, challenges and opportunities. In addition, this study encourages future research by indicating the areas that have not yet been studied in the PdM literature.

AB  - Abstract Engineering design shows a growing interest in exploring cost analysis to anticipate manufacturing issues and integrate production aspects within the product development process. This research aims to highlight key elements (inputs, parameters, models) to accurately predict the cost of a forged part using a complete model, with important information that can be available during the design phase. For this purpose, a systematic literature review of existing engineering methodologies developed for cost analysis of forged parts (i.e., cost estimation, DtC, and ABC) was performed with characterizations of the different approaches for evaluating the most important topics related to this objective. As a result, the most important insights related to the aim of this review are provided: (i) among quantitative methods, analytical and parametric models are the most suitable approaches to develop a cost estimation, (ii) a cost model based on a linear equation supported by single or multiple variables seems to be the most accurate tool to establish a robust cost analysis in the design of forged components, and (iii) input parameters related to the material type and geometrical features are the most critical cost-drivers in the cost assessment. Moreover, this review contributes to identifying emerging applications and obsolete topics, providing the ground to investigate unexplored areas relevant to future research.

AB  - Citations acknowledge the impact a scientific publication has on subsequent work. At the same time, deciding how and when to cite a paper, is also heavily influenced by social factors. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis based on a dataset of 2010-2012 global publications in chemical engineering. We use social network analysis and text mining to measure publication attributes and understand which variables can better help predicting their future success. Controlling for intrinsic quality of a publication and for the number of authors in the byline, we are able to predict scholarly impact of a paper in terms of citations received six years after publication with almost 80 percent accuracy. Results suggest that, all other things being equal, it is better to co-publish with rotating co-authors and write the papers' abstract using more positive words, and a more complex, thus more informative, language.

AB  - Finding new industry partners poses a challenge to many public research organizations. This article explores how statistical classification can support partner selection at the example of the Fraunhofer Society in Germany, Europe's largest public organization for applied research. We use internal cooperation data and feature sets based on unstructured data, i.e., text and industry codes, both of which describe business activities of firms. An important advantage of this data is that it is available for most companies in Germany, even small and medium enterprises, which allows for an almost complete screening of the market, in contrast to using other data sources, e.g., patents. In addition, we also include economic variables linked to firms, as turnover, number of employees/managers and firm age. We report the performance of various classification techniques such as logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forests in our dataset for diverse combinations of feature sets. Results show that simple methods with fewer parameters remain competitive in comparison to complex ones. Overall, the performance of most classifiers is high enough to support the decision process of finding new industry partners for public research.

AB  - Digital twin technology develops virtual models of objects digitally, simulating their real-world behavior based on data. It aims to reduce product development cycles and costs through feedback between the virtual and real worlds, data fusion analysis, and iterative decision-making optimization. Traditional manufacturing processes often face challenges such as poor real-time monitoring and interaction during machining, difficulties in diagnosing equipment failures, and significant errors in machining. Digital twin technology offers a powerful solution to these issues. Initially, a comprehensive review of the research literature was conducted to assess the current research scope and trends. This was followed by an explanation of the basic concepts of digital twins and the technical pathway for integrating digital twins into intelligent manufacturing including outlining the essential technologies for creating a system of interaction between the virtual and real worlds, enabling multimodel fusion, data sensing, algorithm-based prediction, and intelligent decision-making. Moreover, the application of digital twins in intelligent manufacturing throughout the product life cycle was detailed, covering product design, manufacturing, and service stages. Specifically, in the manufacturing phase, a model based on heat conduction theory and visualization was used to construct a time-varying error model for the motion axis, leading to experiments predicting the time-varying error in the hole spacing of a workpiece. These experiments achieved a minimum prediction error of only 0.2 μm compared to the actual error. By compensating for time-varying errors in real time, the variability in the hole spacing error decreased by 69.19%. This paper concludes by summarizing the current state of digital twins in intelligent manufacturing and projecting future trends in key technologies, application areas, and data use, providing a basis for further research.

AB  - Providing food has become more complex because of climate change and other environmental and societal stressors, such as political instability, the growth in the world population, and outbreaks of new diseases, especially the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to these challenges, the agri-food industry has increased its efforts to shift to using more digital tools and other advanced technologies. The transition toward digital has been part of the fourth industrial revolution (called Industry 4.0) innovations that have and are reshaping most industries. This literature review discusses the potential of implementing digital technologies in the agri-food industry, focusing heavily on the role of the COVID-19 pandemic in fostering the adoption of greater digitalization of food supply chains. Examples of the use of these digital innovations for various food applications, and the barriers and challenges will be highlighted. The trend toward digital solutions has gained momentum since the advent of Industry 4.0 and implementations of these solutions have been accelerated by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Important digital technology enablers that have high potential for mitigating the negative effects of both the current global health pandemic and the environmental crisis on food systems include artificial intelligence, big data, the Internet of Things, blockchain, smart sensors, robotics, digital twins, and virtual and augmented reality. However, much remains to be done to fully harness the power of Industry 4.0 technologies and achieve widespread implementation of digitalization in the agriculture and food industries.

AB  - Background: Organisations must respond quickly and consistently to ongoing global shifts. This streak separates remaining competitive from losing market share. Globalisation has accounted for the majority of this transformation, which has been reinforced by rapid digital transformation. Industry experts and researchers are continually studying effective remedies to this worldwide transition as part of their response to this drive. This is required because the world is changing unavoidably, and effective responses to the change should be investigated. Objectives: To study the relationship between Agile and innovation, and how this relationship might facilitate organisations' reaction to global changes, in response to the battle of how to adapt to global transformations successfully. Method: A systematic literature review analysing 1645 peer-reviewed journals through the use of social network analysis. Results: The terms 'Agile,' 'digital transformation', 'design thinking', 'agility', 'innovation management', 'lean', 'Industry 4.0', 'Agile development' and 'digital innovation' have the strongest links to 'innovation'. This demonstrates how innovation is reliant on Agile and its characteristics. Furthermore, the computed data clusters from the analysed dataset led to five propositions: (1) Agility sustains innovation strategies (P1). (2) Collaborating Agile methodology with digital innovation leads to competitive advantage (P2). (3) Agile development accelerates or facilitates new business models, such as Industry 4.0 (P3). (4) Design thinking creates value in innovation management or development of new product (P4). Lastly, (5) the concept or theory of lean Agile management (P5). Conclusion: The correlation between Agile and innovation is critical for effective responses to global digital transformations that are ongoing.

AB  - The advancement of multi-source Earth observation technology has led to a substantial body of literature on inland water monitoring. This has resulted in the emergence of a distinct interdisciplinary field encompassing the application of multi-source Earth observation techniques in inland water monitoring. Despite this growth, few systematic reviews of this field exist. Therefore, in this paper, we offer a comprehensive analysis based on 30,212 publications spanning the years 1990 to 2022, providing valuable insights. We collected and analyzed fundamental information such as publication year, country, affiliation, journal, and author details. Through co-occurrence analysis, we identified country and author partnerships, while co-citation analysis revealed the influence of journals, authors, and documents. We employed keywords to explore the evolution of hydrological phenomena and study areas, using burst analysis to predict trends and frontiers. We discovered exponential growth in this field with a closer integration of hydrological phenomena and Earth observation techniques. The research focus has shifted from large glaciers to encompass large river basins and the Tibetan Plateau. Long-term research attention has been dedicated to optical properties, sea level, and satellite gravity. The adoption of automatic image recognition and processing, enabled by deep learning and artificial intelligence, has opened new interdisciplinary avenues. The results of the study emphasize the significance of long-term, stable, and accurate global observation and monitoring of inland water, particularly in the context of cloud computing and big data.

AB  - Selecting the right supplier is a critical decision in sustainable supply chain management. Sustainable supplier selection plays an important role in achieving a balance between the three pillars of a sustainable supply chain: economic, environmental, and social. One of the most crucial aspects of running a business in this regard is sustainable supplier selection, and, to this end, an accurate and reliable approach is required. Therefore, the main contribution of this paper is to propose and implement an ontology-based approach for knowledge acquisition from the text for a sustainable supplier selection domain. This approach is dedicated to acquiring complex relationships from texts and coding these in the form of rules. The expected outcome is to enrich the existing domain ontology by these rules to obtain higher relational expressiveness, make reasoning, and produce new knowledge.

AB  - Social media is important for situational awareness during a disaster. During a disaster, the situation of emergence often changes over time and hence the topics of social media messages generated by social media users also change accordingly. Few studies quantitatively describe the topic evolution of social media during a disaster and the corresponding relationship between topic evolution and disaster process. We address this problem using co-word network analysis and present a new method based on the community evolution of the co-word network to analyze topic evolution over time in social media. The method uses communities of the co-word network in social media to represent topics. Based on the theory of community evolution, a community evolutional network is proposed to support and quantify the evolution of the topics. We implemented the proposed method in a case study, "July 2012 Beijing flood" using the Sina Weibo dataset. Results show that our method can well quantify the evolution process of topics and validate the effectiveness of our method in real-world applications. The method can facilitate the understanding of public expression dynamics during a disaster and be used to reveal the process and stages of a disaster.

AB  - Abstract A scholarly recommendation system is an important tool for identifying prior and related resources such as literature, datasets, grants, and collaborators. A well-designed scholarly recommender significantly saves the time of researchers and can provide information that would not otherwise be considered. The usefulness of scholarly recommendations, especially literature recommendations, has been established by the widespread acceptance of web search engines such as CiteSeerX, Google Scholar, and Semantic Scholar. This article discusses different aspects and developments of scholarly recommendation systems. We searched the ACM Digital Library, DBLP, IEEE Explorer, and Scopus for publications in the domain of scholarly recommendations for literature, collaborators, reviewers, conferences and journals, datasets, and grant funding. In total, 225 publications were identified in these areas. We discuss methodologies used to develop scholarly recommender systems. Content-based filtering is the most commonly applied technique, whereas collaborative filtering is more popular among conference recommenders. The implementation of deep learning algorithms in scholarly recommendation systems is rare among the screened publications. We found fewer publications in the areas of the dataset and grant funding recommenders than in other areas. Furthermore, studies analyzing users’ feedback to improve scholarly recommendation systems are rare for recommenders. This survey provides background knowledge regarding existing research on scholarly recommenders and aids in developing future recommendation systems in this domain.

AB  - Ontologies play a pivotal role in knowledge representation, particularly beneficial for the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector due to its inherent data diversity and intricacy. Despite the growing interest in ontology and data integration research, especially with the advent of knowledge graphs and digital twins, a noticeable lack of consolidated academic synthesis still needs to be addressed. This review paper aims to bridge that gap, meticulously analysing 142 journal articles from 2000 to 2021 on the application of ontologies in the AEC sector. The research is segmented through systematic evaluation into ten application domains within the construction realm- process, cost, operation/maintenance, health/safety, sustainability, monitoring/control, intelligent cities, heritage building information modelling (HBIM), compliance, and miscellaneous. This categorisation aids in pinpointing ontologies suitable for various research objectives. Furthermore, the paper highlights prevalent limitations within current ontology studies in the AEC sector. It offers strategic recommendations, presenting a well-defined path for future research to address these gaps.

AB  - Objective: In this synopsis, the editors of the Clinical Information Systems (CIS) section of the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics overview recent research and propose a selection of best papers published in 2022 in the CIS field. Methods: The editors follow a systematic approach to gather relevant articles and select the best papers for the section. This year, they updated the query to incorporate the topic of telemedicine and removed search terms related to geographic information systems. The revised query resulted in a larger number of identified papers, necessitating the appointment of a third section editor to handle the increased workload. The editors narrowed the initial pool of articles to 15 candidate papers through a multi-stage selection process. At least seven independent reviews were collected for each candidate paper, and a selection meeting with the IMIA Yearbook editorial board led to the final selection of the best papers for the CIS section. Results: The query was carried out in mid-January 2023 and retrieved a deduplicated result set of 5,206 articles from 1,500 journals. This year, 15 papers were nominated as candidates, and four were finally selected as the best papers in the CIS section. Including telemedicine in the query resulted in a substantial increase in the number of papers found. The analysis highlights the growing convergence between clinical information systems and telemedicine, with mobile health (mHealth) technologies and data science applications gaining prominence. The selected candidate papers emphasize the practical impact of research efforts, focusing on patient-centric outcomes and benefits, including intelligent mobile health monitoring systems and AI-assisted decision-making in healthcare. Conclusions: Looking ahead, the field of CIS is expected to continue evolving, driven by advances in telemedicine, mHealth technologies, data science, and AI integration, leading to more efficient, patient-oriented, and intelligent healthcare systems and overall improvement of global healthcare outcomes.

AB  - Poverty is one of the biggest problems in the world caused by the lack of resources necessary to meet the basic needs of human survival. Ending global poverty is one of the main tasks of large organizations around the world, as well as the United Nations has established 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the first goal being the “eradication of poverty”. On the other hand, 5G technology has been considered one of the most important revolutions in the digital era and has been highlighted for its ability to improve people’s quality of life. As this technology expands around the world, it is important to understand how it could contribute to poverty reduction, a major global challenge. To carry out this literature review work, various sources of information were used, with a total of 329 articles from which 49 relevant articles were obtained. It was identified that the sectors with the greatest contribution to poverty reduction are Government, Society, and Agriculture. It was also found that the most relevant 5G technology that influences poverty reduction on a larger scale is the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. Being applied mainly in precision agriculture and Smart Cities. This review provides a reference point for the analysis of the use of 5G technologies in different sectors, with the aim of promoting equality and economic inclusion in rural areas and future research on the various factors that affect poverty reduction.

AB  - Computer science has experienced dramatic growth and diversification over the last twenty years. Towards a current understanding of the structure of this discipline, we analyze a large sample of the computer science literature from the DBLP database. For insight on the features of this cohort and the relationship within its components, we have constructed article level clusters based on either direct citations or co-citations, and reconciled them with major and minor subject categories in the All Science Journal Classification. We describe complementary insights from clustering by direct citation and co-citation, and both point to the increase in computer science publications and their scope. Our analysis reveals cross-category clusters, some that interact with external fields, such as the biological sciences, while others remain inward looking. Overall, we document an increase in computer science publications and their scope.

AB  - The process of agricultural robot design is a complex system requiring the cooperation and integration of agricultural, machinery, automation, and information technology. These demands create great challenges for the innovative design of agricultural robots. Meanwhile, more than 95% of the latest inventions and creations in the world are recorded in the patent literature. In order to make effective use of the information and data resources of patents, shorten the design cycle, and provide knowledge for the designers, according to the operation’s objectives, an agricultural robot technology knowledge graph (TKG) was established for innovative designs. By analyzing the patent information, a patent IPC co-classification network (IPCNet) for adaptive design process recognition was put forward to meet the requirements of the different operation objectives and operation links. Through the extraction of the technology keywords and efficacy keywords, based on the word co-occurrence network (WCONet), a technology–efficacy map (TEM) was constructed. Through the integration of the adaptive design process and the TEM, the agricultural robot design TKG was constructed for determining technological recommendations for agricultural robot design. The case of the citrus picking robot design was realized to implement the design process. With the technology recommendation results, the moving system, body, and end-effector for the citrus picking robot were designed to verify the results of the recommendation.

AB  - Crypto assets succeeded in making their name known to large masses with Bitcoin, which emerged as a result of the creation of the first genesis block in 2008. Until 2010, the aforementioned recognition showed itself mostly in areas such as games, but over time it managed to enter the portfolios of individual investors. Especially as of end of 2017, the rapid increases in monetary value quickly attracted the attention of corporate companies and then the (Central Banks). These assets have created different alternatives (also know as altcoins) by working and have managed to become one of the important financial instruments today. This study has examined in detail the techniques (Chaos theory, Onchain analysis and Sentiment analysis) developed on the price predictions of crypto assets, which are very important in terms of the number and quality of investors. In the study, findings were obtained that new techniques such as onchain and sentiment are more prominent in estimating crypto asset prices compared to traditional asset price estimation methods of crypto assets and that these techniques can make consistent estimations.

AB  - Limited attention has been afforded to mapping the ‘landscape’ of South African computing research. Prior studies have considered singular sub-disciplines, publications, or publication types. Given the growing prominence of computing disciplines, it is necessary to identify the patterns of research production, publication, collaboration, and impact of South African computing research. This study presents a scientometric investigation in this regard. Through the analysis of data accessed from the Scopus citation enhanced bibliographic database, the investigation presents findings in relation to annual research production, institutional differences in outputs, topics, collaboration, and citation impact. While characterised by institutional differences, over the period considered, South African computing research output has increased at a greater rate than that of South African research at large. Additionally, despite accounting for a greater proportion of all outputs, conference papers account for a smaller proportion of citations relative to journal articles or book chapters. Corresponding to previous investigations, there exists a tendency towards applied computing topics in contrast to more theoretical topics. Finally, the collaboration network was shown to be particularly de-centralised with many researchers clustered around institutions. The findings are of interest to all researchers conducting computing or related research in South Africa.

AB  - The effects of a landslide can represent a very big problem, including the death of people, damage to the land, environmental pollution and the loss of natural resources. Landslides are the most important medium for transferring sediments and polluting waterways by earth and organic materials. An excess of sediments reduces the quality of fish habitat and the potability of water. In order to understand landslides in depth, a thorough study was conducted using a scientometric analysis, as well as a thorough practical examination of landslide analysis and monitoring techniques. This review focused on methods used for landslide analysis, including physical models requiring easily prepared event-based landslide inventory, probabilistic methods which are useful for both shallow and earthquake-based landslides, and landslide monitoring performed by remote sensing techniques, which provide data helpful for prediction, monitoring and mapping. The fundamental principles of each method are described in terms of the method used, and its advantages, and limits. People and infrastructure are at danger from landslides caused by heavy rain, so this report highlights landslide-prone regions and considers the analysis methods for landslides used in these countries, with a view to identifying mitigation measures for coping with landslide risks in hilly areas. Furthermore, future landslide research possibilities, as well as possible modeling methods, are addressed. The report summarizes some landslide prediction and monitoring techniques used in landslide-prone countries which can help inform researchers seeking to protect the public from danger in landslide areas.

AB  - Power generation in the global power sector has recently seen a paradigm shift from centralized bulk generation to distributed generation. In this regard, there are two transmission technologies available: high-voltage alternating current (HVAC) and high-voltage direct current (HVDC). The technical and economic benefits of HVDC transmission technology have enabled many countries to implement it widely for long-distance bulk power transmission, particularly between remote locations and densely populated areas. HVDC technology, however, is still relatively new in Pakistan. Despite this, HVDC technology holds great promise in Pakistan, specifically in utilizing and integrating distributed renewable energy sources with the national grid, as well as enabling cross-border energy trade. This study aims to provide a first-ever scientometric analysis of the HVDC technology field, highlighting key research themes and trends. A correlation is established between HVDC research and its adoption in Pakistan by extracting articles from the Scopus database and analyzing them with the VOS viewer, a modern data analysis tool. The scientometric analysis indicates a minimal contribution from Pakistani authors in the field of HVDC technology as compared to authors of the neighboring nations, highlighting a significant gap in knowledge transfer and technology adoption. Moreover, an overview of HVDC technology is provided, along with a comparison between HVAC and HVDC technologies. Last but not least, Pakistan's existing and proposed HVDC projects, prospects, and challenges associated with HVDC adoption are discussed.

AB  - Modern urbanism is called to face current challenges ranging from intensive demographic growth, economic and social stagnation to resources salvation and climate changes. Under the broader scope of sustainability, we argue that the transition to a holistic perspective of smart and regenerative planning and design is the way to face and yet to prevent these urban challenges. In doing so, we adopt systematic thinking to study the complexity of urban metabolisms at an urban place scale, emphasizing the ongoing coevolution of social-cultural-technological and ecological processes. Focusing on urban places, we give a city or region the sense of a place of stability, security, cultural and social interactions, and a sense of uniqueness. We plan and design innovative urban places that improve the environment and the quality of urban life, able to adapt and mitigate climate changes and natural hazards, leverage community spirit, and power a green-based economy. Designing the conceptual framework of smart and regenerative urban places we contribute to the field of modern urban studies helping practitioners, policymakers, and decision-makers to vision and adopt more environmental-friendly policies and actions using a user-centered approach.

AB  - Purpose: Businesses in all sectors, including the secondary industry, will turn to tech-business analytics as a crucial tool. Tech-Business Analytics' role in the secondary industrial sector is to support companies in making data-driven decisions that optimize their operations, boost productivity, and boost profitability. Businesses may optimize their supply chains by accessing data on suppliers, inventories, logistics, and other aspects to spot inefficiencies and areas for improvement. Organizations can use this information to reduce downtime and boost production to schedule maintenance in advance and predict when machinery and equipment will likely break. Examining data on product flaws, customer complaints, and other aspects can help firms improve their quality control systems by identifying root causes and implementing corrective measures. Studying data on consumer behaviour, industry trends, and other factors can help organizations optimize their sales and marketing activities and find chances for expansion and higher profitability. Design/Methodology/Approach: Businesses can use several processes in the tech-business analytics methodology to help them make decisions based on data in the secondary industry sector. This secondary industry sector can entail enhancing the effectiveness of the supply chain or decreasing equipment downtime. After identifying the issue, the necessary data must be gathered and prepared. Once the data is collected, it must be analyzed using statistical models and other analytical methods. This collected data might entail looking for relationships between multiple variables, spotting trends in consumer behaviour, or predicting outcomes using predictive models. Findings/Result: It is described in the article how tech-business analytics in the secondary industrial sector will have managed the growth itself from its inception to the present. The Tech-Business Analytics technique in the secondary industry sector offers a structured approach to problem-solving using data analysis to assist in better decision-making and improve business outcomes. Originality/Value: Exploring the evolutionary path of business analytics transforms into the advanced realm of technology-driven business analytics within the secondary industry sector. A generic architecture also examines 130 recently published Tech Business Analytics in Secondary Industry sector research projects for technical purposes. Tech-Business Analytics is a new field that applies ICCT-underpinning technologies in Tech-Business Analytics (TBA). TBA is intended to provide businesses with unprecedented opportunities for growth and innovation in secondary industry sectors. Paper Type: Exploratory research.

AB  - By adopting a systematic literature and science mapping review, this paper aims to explore the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on organizational justice and project performance. A total of 47 bibliographic records from the Scopus database were analyzed. The results revealed the annual publication trends of research articles and relevant peer-reviewed journals in the studied domain. It was found that while AI technology has made significant progress in several fields, its application areas in project management and organizational justice are still relatively low. Moreover, it objectively discussed the co-occurrence analysis of keywords, co-authors, countries/regions, and documents in the fields, revealing the current research topics. The main research topics include the (1) AI’s influence on organizational justice, decision analysis, and digital transformation, (2) fostering organizational justice and AI’s role in enhancing project performance, and (3) improving organizational performance approaches. Furthermore, this paper proposed research gaps and future research directions, including (1) advancing business intelligence strategies, (2) unlocking AI technology potential on organizational justice and project performance, (3) the adaption of cultural, diversity, environmental, and social factors, (4) the impact of AI on complex and challenging leadership styles, and (5) developing a comprehensive understanding of the agile framework. The findings of this paper could contribute to a better understanding of how AI shapes project/construction management and organizational justice, providing practical solutions for innovative development for researchers and policymakers.

AB  - The volume and diversity of scientific literature are escalating every day and millions of new scientific articles are published every year. Researchers work and publish in their respective fields of interest. A major portion of the scientific community publishing in the same field of interest forms a trend in the field which could be deemed as relatively more popular than other trends. A pioneering researcher picks a field of interest by depending upon its popularity. This may have a positive impact on the acceptance of a study or high count of citations in future. This study identifies how significant it is to follow a research trend and the impact of the field of study (FoS) trend on research paper citations. For this purpose, we have chosen the field of Computer Science and Microsoft Academic Graph dataset from the 2007-2015 time period. In the dataset, every paper has a list of fields of study. The FoS provided in MAG is systematized hierarchically into 4 levels; level-0 - level-3. In this study, we apply the clustering technique to the FoS and citations pattern separately. Likewise, we also analyze how papers following a FoS trend, gain citations over the time. We also introduce a novel method Field of Study Multigraph (FoM) using graph centrality measures degree, betweenness and closeness to analyze the FoS trend, citation trend, and the relation between research areas in scientific articles from the domain of Computer Science. The experimental results show that the FoS has a certain impact on citation count. Furthermore, the results depicts that if papers belong to the same FoS, then there are 66% of the chances of having a similar citation pattern and that they have the same citation trend as they also achieved a high correlation value. This proves that a FoS has a certain impact on the citation count of a paper and researchers should contemplate the FoS trend before selecting a particular research area.

AB  - Abstract Research on academic paper ranking has received great attention in recent years, and many algorithms have been proposed to automatically assess a large number of papers for this purpose. How to evaluate or analyse the performance of these ranking algorithms becomes an open research question. Theoretically, evaluation of an algorithm requires to compare its ranking result against a ground truth paper list. However, such ground truth does not exist in the field of scholarly ranking due to the fact that there does not and will not exist an absolutely unbiased, objective, and unified standard to formulate the impact of papers. Therefore, in practice researchers evaluate or analyse their proposed ranking algorithms by different methods, such as using domain expert decisions (test data) and comparing against predefined ranking benchmarks. The question is whether using different methods leads to different analysis results, and if so, how should we analyse the performance of the ranking algorithms? To answer these questions, this study compares among test data and different citation-based benchmarks by examining their relationships and assessing the effect of the method choices on their analysis results. The results of our experiments show that there does exist difference in analysis results when employing test data and different benchmarks, and relying exclusively on one benchmark or test data may bring inadequate analysis results. In addition, a guideline on how to conduct a comprehensive analysis using multiple benchmarks from different perspectives is summarised, which can help provide a systematic understanding and profile of the analysed algorithms.

AB  - Urban land use is a core area of multidisciplinary research that involves geography, land science, and urban planning. With the rapid progress of global urbanization, urban expansion has become a research focus in recent years. Therefore, how to scientifically and accurately identify key and common themes in the urban expansion literature has become crucial for scientific research institutions in various countries. This paper proposes a new framework for identifying such themes based on an analysis of scientific literature and by using text mining and thematic evolutionary analysis. First, the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm is used to capture the thematic clustering of scientific literature. Second, the key degree of the thematic node in the thematic evolution transfer network is used to represent the key feature of a theme, and the PageRank algorithm is employed to measure the critical score of this theme. When recognizing common themes, the common features of various themes are digitized and mapped to a specially selected quadratic function to measure the degree of commonness. Finally, the hidden Markov model is used to build a thematic prediction model. This method can efficiently identify key and common themes from the literature and provide theoretical and technical support for future research in related fields.

AB  - We study terrorism’s shaping of STEM research through the development within engineeringresearch of a ‘terrorismmindedness’, i.e. terrorist threat domestication through integration in research practice. This is done by a distant reading of how research in the engineering sciences is increasingly addressing terrorism-related topics. By means of an in-depth bibliometric analysis of some 3.000 terrorism-related scientific articles published 1989–2022, we construct within the subject area ‘Engineering’ in Web of Science its research subfield ‘Terrorism Related Engineering Research’. The publications are analysed by bibliometric mapping, co-occurrence text measures and ‘algorithmic historiography’ using the HistCite tool. Papers cited together are mapped using VOSviewer to identify concepts and the results are clustered according to topicality, revealing the various terrorism-related research interests among engineering scientists.

AB  - Abstract Industrial facilities collect large volumes of data, store them according to prescribed protocols, and then interpret them for process decision‐making. Several sources and types of error contaminate these data for various reasons, but especially because they come from unreliable or unpredictable instruments. Data (or signal) processing corrects measurement errors to improve fidelity. Here, we highlight decision‐making applications and signal processing methods. To fully appreciate the state‐of‐the‐art, we interviewed plant data experts and software developers in the pulp and paper industry to examine how they apply signal processing methods in the context of decision‐making, including the value of process data, how these data are used, and the major barriers that prevent plants from using data. Process experts clean data thoroughly with basic approaches compared to the advanced techniques available in the recent literature. The interviews demonstrate that decisions in industry are primarily based on steady‐state process operating data. Challenges and barriers that prevent the use of process data to their full potential relate to resource limitations (people, time, and money), an entrenched culture, and access to recent technology. In practice, experts consider, implicitly or explicitly, data that represent the process operating under steady‐state conditions. A plant model that represents steady‐state operations is easier to interpret, is presented in a form that is usable by plant operators, and in this way, better enables decision‐making.

AB  - Keeping track of translational research is essential to evaluating the performance of programs on translational medicine. Despite several indicators in previous studies, a consensus measure is still needed to represent the translational features of biomedical research at the article level. In this study, we first trained semantic representations of biomedical entities and documents (i.e., bio-entity2vec and bio-doc2vec) based on over 30 million PubMed articles. With these vectors, we then developed a new measure called Translational Progression (TP) for tracking biomedical articles along the translational continuum. We validated the effectiveness of TP from two perspectives (Clinical trial phase identification and ACH classification), which showed excellent consistency between TP and other indicators. Meanwhile, TP has several advantages. First, it can track the degree of translation of biomedical research dynamically and in real-time. Second, it is straightforward to interpret and operationalize. Third, it doesn't require labor-intensive MeSH labeling and it is suitable for big scholarly data as well as papers that are not indexed in PubMed. In addition, we examined the translational progressions of biomedical research from three dimensions (including overall distribution, time, and research topic), which revealed three significant findings. The proposed measure in this study could be used by policymakers to monitor biomedical research with high translational potential in real-time and make better decisions. It can also be adopted and improved for other domains, such as physics or computer science, to assess the application value of scientific discoveries.

AB  - In applied software engineering, the algorithms for selecting the appropriate test cases are used to perform regression testing. The key objective of this activity is to make sure that modification in the system under test (SUT) has no impact on the overall functioning of the updated software. It is concluded from the literature that the efficacy of the test case selection solely depends on the following metrics, namely, the execution cost of the test case, the lines of the code covered in unit time also known as the code coverage, the ability to capture the potential faults, and the code modifications. Furthermore, it is also observed that the approaches for the regression testing developed so far generated results by focusing on one or two parameters. In this paper, our key objectives are twofold: one is to explore the importance of the role of each metric in detail. The secondary objective is to study the combined effect of these metrics in test case selection task that is capable of achieving more than one objective. In this paper, a detailed and comprehensive review of the work related to regression testing is provided in a very distinct and principled way. This survey will be useful for the researchers contributing to the field of regression testing. It is noteworthy that our systematic literature review (SLR) included the noteworthy work published from 2007 to 2020. Our study observed that about 52 relevant studies focused on all of the four metrics to perform their respective tasks. The results also revealed that about 30% of the different categories of regression test case reported the results using metaheuristic regression test selection (RTS). Similarly, about 31% of the literature reported results using the generic regression test case selection techniques. Most of the researchers focus on the datasets, namely, Software-Artefact Infrastructure Repository (SIR), JodaTime, TreeDataStructure, and Apache Software Foundation. For validation purpose, following parameters were focused, namely, the inclusiveness, precision, recall, and retest-all.

AB  - Classifying scientific publications according to Field-of-Science (FoS) taxonomies is of crucial importance, allowing funders, publishers, scholars, companies and other stakeholders to organize scientific literature more effectively. Most existing works address classification either at venue level or solely based on the textual content of a research publication. We present SciNoBo, a novel classification system of publications to predefined FoS taxonomies, leveraging the structural properties of a publication and its citations and references organized in a multilayer network. In contrast to other works, our system supports assignments of publications to multiple fields by considering their multidisciplinarity potential. By unifying publications and venues under a common multilayer network structure made up of citing and publishing relationships, classifications at the venue-level can be augmented with publication-level classifications. We evaluate SciNoBo on a dataset of publications extracted from Microsoft Academic Graph, and we perform a comparative analysis against a state-of-the-art neural-network baseline. The results reveal that our proposed system is capable of producing high-quality classifications of publications.

AB  - The concept of the internet of energy (IoE) emerged as an innovative paradigm to encompass all the complex and intertwined notions relevant to the transition of current smart grids towards more decarbonization, digitalization and decentralization. With a focus on the two last aspects, the amount of intelligent devices being connected in a scattered way to the existing power grid is ever-growing. Nevertheless, guaranteeing a cyber-secure and resilient control of these IoE components as well as a seamless and reliable delivery of electricity services, such as renewable energy exchange, electric vehicles charging, demand response, and so forth; might be the bottleneck of current power systems that are largely still functioning following a centralized approach. Thus, the future power grid would gradually incorporate a growing number of distributed-based control schemes to deal with this challenge. And many believe that blockchain could be a key-enabler in this transition, due to its consistent characteristics with multiple requirements of future power systems. In this paper, we provide an extensive state-of-the-art of blockchain-based additions to the IoE. Where, we first introduce various concepts related to blockchain and discuss the rationale behind its adoption in the context of IoE. Then, differently from the existing body of literature surveys, we do not only provide a taxonomy and evaluate a wide range of recent research outputs that integrated blockchain within modern power systems. But we also draw some valuable lessons learned for each studied category and discuss the intersection of blockchain with various emerging paradigms that have the potential of radically impacting the smart grid. In addition, we present some real-world industrial initiatives and ongoing projects built on top of blockchain, dedicated for offering diverse electricity services with a case study of a pilot project on energy trading in Amsterdam. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges and worthwhile opportunities of deploying blockchain in this particular area, with a focus on the aspect of operational cyber-security.

AB  - In scientific papers, it is common practice to cite other articles to substantiate claims, provide evidence for factual assertions, reference limitations, and research gaps, and fulfill various other purposes. When authors include a citation in a given sentence, there are two considerations they need to take into account: (i) where in the sentence to place the citation and (ii) which citation to choose to support the underlying claim. In this paper, we focus on the first task as it allows multiple potential approaches that rely on the researcher's individual style and the specific norms and conventions of the relevant scientific community. We propose two automatic methodologies that leverage transformers architecture for either solving a Mask-Filling problem or a Named Entity Recognition problem. On top of the results of the proposed methodologies, we apply ad-hoc Natural Language Processing heuristics to further improve their outcome. We also introduce s2orc-9K, an open dataset for fine-tuning models on this task. A formal evaluation demonstrates that the generative approach significantly outperforms five alternative methods when fine-tuned on the novel dataset. Furthermore, this model's results show no statistically significant deviation from the outputs of three senior researchers.

AB  - Complex engineering systems, such as power plants, deliver their best performance when operating along a designed range of some priority parameters. However, plant field operation may deviate from design conditions, and new references must be identified. Actions towards high-quality operation can be supported by fine modeling, which helps building decision support tools. The present work proposes a standardization strategy for the operation of an actual coal-fired power plant based on a Design of Experiment approach, partially tested onsite and finally accomplished with surrogate models built upon a 2 year long database. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Mass and Energy balances (M&Es) are used to represent the plant's steam generator and its mills subset, which is the core of an operational guide to increase system efficiency under actual operation. Primary and secondary air flows, pulverized coal outlet temperature, speed of the dynamic classifier, primary air flow, excess O2, primary and secondary air pressures are the seven controllable factors selected as the most relevant ones among an extensive set of parameters, able to perform effective maneuvers. The application of the operational guide indicates combinations of ranges of the seven controllable parameters that allow for achieving steam generator efficiency within the 84.0% to 88.92% range. The proposed methodology aims as well to improve safe and stable conditions to a system that undergoes operation different than the one prescribed by the original design. The study case results show an opportunity to raise efficiency by up to 2.28% during operation, which represents a reduction in coal consumption by 3.1 t/h and above 6% on CO2 emissions.

AB  - With the continuous advancement of big data technology, there are many drawbacks in the past urban greenway design. The environment, population distribution, geographic location, spatial distribution, and other factors affect the greenway design. At the same time, a large amount of historical data is mixed. The systematic arrangement has indirectly led to the fact that urban greenway design does not know how to analyze and use past data. There is always a waste of various resources. While greenways bring many positive impacts, they also have negative impacts: it is difficult for the wild animals in the greenways to move along the predetermined passages, and most animals spread in the greenways in a disorderly manner, so that the greenways accelerate the invasion of alien species and diseases to a certain extent. Using big data technology can enable us to allocate resources more reasonably and accurately. The purpose of this article is to study the use of big data technology to rationalize our urban greenway design. This paper adopts a calculation method that closely combines quantitative and qualitative features to study its features. The local feature analysis algorithm can extract and analyze urban spatial data. Spatial remote sensing image technology can deepen our knowledge and understanding of urban spatial characteristics, conduct data mining, provide all the information of urban space, analyze the content and type, and classify it; then filter and integrate the big data in the greenway planning and design information. The information about greenway planning and design in the big data of Dao Design is digitized. This information can be composed of traditional data and dynamic data. Finally, after scientific analysis, the data is subjected to scenario assumptions, modeling, and output, we applied various analysis results to actual operations, and we obtain the final inspection. In fact, this is also going out from actual work, summing up the experience we have done, and again starting from the perspective of specific practice. Compared with our traditional field investigation before, with the guidance of big data analysis, the experimental results of this article show that under the use of big data technology, the wrong resolution of the SegNet semantic classification algorithm for buildings is 9.6%, and the others are 10.9%, 16%, 20%, etc., which are all greater than 9.6%, so the segNet model has a higher image acquisition accuracy. It can solve the problems caused by the lag of the past questionnaires and the small sample size, improve the accuracy of data extraction through algorithms, find some features and problems of greenway design, and complete the urban greening rate through computer algorithms. Calculation and analysis can better provide the most reasonable method for greenway design site selection and route selection.

AB  - The primary reason for detecting emerging topics is to reduce researchers’ time in finding current related topic while maintaining awareness of current trends in a particular field. Nowadays, the amount of information is growing rapidly, but tracking the development of a research field by manually reading the literature is challenging. This study takes Library and Information Science (LIS) as a case study to present a new method for detecting emerging topics. This novel method could be applied to analyse various types of documents and detect emerging topics automatically. This method utilizes a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to generate topics and calculate probabilities. It discovers emerging topics by detecting probability burst in consecutive time spans. Association rule mining and lexical similarity computation are adopted to represent the topics. This work tests the method by comparing the results of emerging topics from the LIS data in the baseline paper. The validation demonstrates that the proposed approach is feasible.

AB  - Everyday thousands of cardiac surgeries are performed worldwide. This article reviews numerous studies on the use of Convolutional Neural Networks and their impact on vascular surgery. The development of computer systems supported by convolutional neural networks that contribute to vascular surgeries represents an important deviation from traditional approaches to the performance of surgical interventions, either through computed tomography verification or the method in which a surgeon ceases to participate in this type of surgical interventions. A systematic literature review (SLR) regarding convolutional neural networks for use in vascular surgeries was conducted for research from 2016 to 2021. The search strategy identified 15,505 papers from various search sources such as ACM Digital Library, EBSCOhost, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, MDPI, Microsoft Academic, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Springer, Web of Science, and Wiley Online Library, from which only 70 papers were considered (selected) based on exclusion criteria. The SLR focused on recent studies on convolutional neural networks where their use in vascular surgeries has been identified. This SLR provides readers with a mapping of all identified findings, making a comparison by relevance in regard to their own settings and possible scenarios. Therefore, it is hoped that this research will help other researchers to understand the current status of Convolutional Neural Networks and their application in Vascular Surgeries.

AB  - Despite the shortcomings and criticisms of world university rankings, such metrics are widely used by students and parents to select institutions and by educational institutions to attract talented students and researchers, as well as funding. This article introduces the first contrast pattern-based scientometric study of world university rankings. Specifically, this study collects a database containing 34 features, which describe the essential research indicators for the top 200 universities in the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) ranking. The use of 18 state-of-the-art classifiers in this database shows that the top 100 universities in the QS World University Rankings are separable from the remaining compared universities, achieving an average accuracy of 71%. Additionally, using a contrast pattern mining algorithm, a set of patterns describing the top 100 universities is extracted based on scientometric features. Additionally, this study proposes an approach for visualizing the extracted patterns to facilitate the decision-makers, such as senior university managers, in formulating and evaluating their research (ranking) strategies.

AB  - It is of great importance to recommend collaborators for scholars in academic social networks, which can benefit more scientific research results. Facing the problem of data sparsity of co-author recommendation in academic social networks, a novel recommendation algorithm named HeteroRWR (Heterogeneous Random Walk with Restart) is proposed. Different from the basic Random Walk with Restart (RWR) model which only walks in homogeneous networks, HeteroRWR implements multiple random walks in a heterogeneous network which integrates a citation network and a co-authorship network to mine the k mostly valuable co-authors for target users. By introducing the citation network, HeteroRWR algorithm can find more suitable candidate authors when the co-authorship network is extremely sparse. Candidate recommenders will not only have high topic similarities with target users, but also have good community centralities. Analyses on the convergence and time efficiency of the proposed approach are presented. Extensive experiments have been conducted on DBLP and CiteSeerX datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that HeteroRWR outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of precision and recall rate even in the case of incorporating an incomplete citation dataset.

AB  - For more than 20 years, disaster dynamic monitoring and early warning have achieved orderly and sustainable development in China, forming a systematic academic research system and top-down policy design, which are inseparable from the research of China’s scientific community and the promotion of government departments. In the past, most of the research on dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning focused on specific research in a certain field, scene, and discipline, while a few studies focused on research review or policy analysis, and few studies combined macro and meso research reviews in academia with national policy analysis for comparative analysis. It is necessary and urgent to explore the interaction between scholars’ research and policy deployment, which can bring theoretical contributions and policy references to the top-down design, implementation promotion, and academic research of China’s dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning. Based on 608 international research articles on dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning published by Chinese scholars from 2000–2021 and 187 national policy documents published during this period, this paper conducts a comparative analysis between the knowledge maps of international research hotspots and the co-occurrence maps of policy keywords on dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning. The research shows that in the stage of initial development (2000–2007), international research articles are few and focused, and research hotspots are somewhat alienated from policy keywords. In the stage of rising development (2008–2015), after the Wenchuan earthquake, research hotspots are closely related to policy keywords, mainly in the fields of geology, engineering disasters, meteorological disasters, natural disasters, etc. Meanwhile, research hotspots also focus on cutting-edge technologies and theories, while national-level policy keywords focus more on overall governance and macro promotion, but the two are gradually closely integrated. In the stage of rapid development (2016–2021), with the continuous attention and policy promotion of the national government, the establishment of the Ministry of Emergency Management, and the gradual establishment and improvement of the disaster early warning and monitoring system, research hotspots and policy keywords are integrated and overlapped with each other, realizing the organic linkage and mutual promotion between academic research and political deployment. The motivation, innovation, integration, and transformation of dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning are promoted by both policy and academic research. The institutions that issue policies at the national level include the State Council and relevant departments, the Ministry of Emergency Management, the Ministry of Water Resources, and other national ministries and commissions. The leading affiliated institutions of scholars’ international research include China University of Mining and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, and other institutions. The disciplines involved are mainly multidisciplinary geosciences, environmental sciences, electrical and electronic engineering, remote sensing, etc. It is worth noting that in the past two to three years, research and policies focusing on COVID-19, public health, epidemic prevention, environmental governance, and emergency management have gradually increased.

AB  - Abstract The Journal of Management Studies , founded in 1963, is celebrating its 60 th year. Clark et al. (2014) conducted a bibliometric analysis for its 50 th anniversary assessing whether the journal had maintained its leading international ranking and sustained its mission to serve as a broad‐based management outlet. In this review, we build on and extend their findings by examining trends in the journal over the past decade (2012–22). We present a broader analysis of JMS by exploring its unique identity within the management journal ecosystem and examining its scope and breadth in terms of topics, methods, and author demographics to document JMS 's evolution, impact, reach, and accessibility. We develop a new bibliometric framework that employs a mix of qualitative and quantitative analyses (including regression, text, and language analysis) to cover a broad range of considerations for a journal and its stakeholders. In so doing, we contribute to the bibliometric and review research areas by proposing new metrics (related to diversity, equity, and inclusion) and analysis tools to assess the relative position of an academic journal. Employing this framework, we conclude that JMS has retained and enhanced its position as a leading, cutting‐edge general management journal.

AB  - Recovering old machinery, once it reaches its end of life, allows companies to be sustainable. Several strategies are available for this purpose, both from the point of view of hardware and software modifications. Especially in the industrial sector, these strategies are classified as revamping, remanufacturing and retrofitting. Machinery revamping, retrofitting and remanufacturing are all used to improve industrial equipment performance, efficiency and sustainability. Each approach has unique benefits and trade-offs, depending on the specific needs and requirements of the equipment and business. Moreover, according to Industry 4.0 principles, it is also possible to talk about smart retrofitting, involving the integration of various technologies such as sensors, automation systems, Digital Twins, artificial intelligence and data analytics software to control and optimise the operation of the machinery. Digital Twins, in particular, have been widely used among smart retrofit solutions and can integrate several innovative aspects of dated systems. However, a literature review needs to clarify their meaning and specific characteristics. For this reason, this paper aims to distinguish different strategies and find a correct definition of smart retrofitting, highlighting its relevance, benefits and sustainability in the industrial sector, focusing more on Digital Twin solutions for smart retrofitting.

AB  - This work demonstrates for the first time the application of network topology of variance decompositions in analyzing the connectedness of chemical plant process variable oscillations arising from disturbances and faults. Specifically, the time-based connectedness and frequency-based connectedness of variables can be used to compute the net pairwise dynamic connectedness (NPDC), which originated as a volatility spillover index for financial markets studies in the field of econometrics. This work used the anomaly-detection benchmark Tennessee-Eastman chemical process (TEP) dataset, which consists of 41 measured variables and 11 manipulated variables subjected to various faulty operating conditions. The data analytics was performed using key functions from the R-package ‘ConnectednessApproach’ that implements connectedness computations based on time and frequency. The NPDC coefficient matrices were then transformed into network adjacency matrices for the rendering of the network topology of connectedness for TEP. The resulting network topologies allow a comprehensive analysis of oscillation effects across all plant-measured and manipulated variables. Analyzing the directed connectedness of the system dynamics at short-range, mid-range, and long-range frequencies showed how the oscillation effects of disturbances and faults propagate and dissipate in the short-term, mid-term, and long-term periods.

The research aims to find the answer to the research question that marketers can benefit from AI in content creation for the digital market. The study also finds the relevance and use of AI in content creation and develops an AI infrastructure adoption model for content creators in digital marketing. The findings of this study were compiled using a systematic literature review that adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) statement and the criteria established by Meta-Analyses. The findings revealed that using AI in content creation provides personalized data, which helps the creators make relevant, targeted, and specific content. The research also finds that AI alone is not mature enough to carry out the whole content creation procedure as there is some limitation attached, especially regarding ethical implications. That’s why human surveillance of AI systems involved in content creation for the digital market is needed.

AB  - Nowadays, in the context of Industry 4.0, advanced working environments aim at achieving a high degree of human–machine collaboration. This phenomenon occurs, on the one hand, through the correct interpretation of operators’ data by machines that can adapt their functioning to support workers, and on the other hand, by ensuring the transparency of the actions of the system itself. This study used an ad hoc system that allowed the co-registration of a set of participants’ implicit and explicit (I/E) data in two experimental conditions that varied in the level of mental workload (MWL). Findings showed that the majority of the considered I/E measures were able to discriminate the different task-related mental demands and some implicit measures were capable of predicting task performance in both tasks. Moreover, self-reported measures showed that participants were aware of such differences in MWL. Finally, the paradigm’s ecology highlights that task and environmental features may affect the reliability of the various I/E measures. Thus, these factors have to be considered in the design and development of advanced adaptive systems within the industrial context.

AB  - Abstract Unsupervised learning algorithms are widely used for many important statistical tasks with numerous applications in science and industry. Yet despite their prevalence, they have attracted remarkably little philosophical scrutiny to date. This stands in stark contrast to supervised and reinforcement learning algorithms, which have been widely studied and critically evaluated, often with an emphasis on ethical concerns. In this article, I analyze three canonical unsupervised learning problems: clustering, abstraction, and generative modeling. I argue that these methods raise unique epistemological and ontological questions, providing data-driven tools for discovering natural kinds and distinguishing essence from contingency. This analysis goes some way toward filling the lacuna in contemporary philosophical discourse on unsupervised learning, as well as bringing conceptual unity to a heterogeneous field more often described by what it is not (i.e., supervised or reinforcement learning) than by what it is . I submit that unsupervised learning is not just a legitimate subject of philosophical inquiry but perhaps the most fundamental branch of all AI. However, an uncritical overreliance on unsupervised methods poses major epistemic and ethical risks. I conclude by advocating for a pragmatic, error-statistical approach that embraces the opportunities and mitigates the challenges posed by this powerful class of algorithms.

AB  - People have presence across different information networks on the social web. The problem of user identity linking, is the task of establishing a connection between accounts of the same user across different networks. Solving this problem is useful for: personalized recommendations, cross platform data enrichment and verifying online information among others. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based approach that jointly models heterogeneous data: text content, network structure as well as profile names and images, in order to solve the user identity linking problem. We perform experiments on a real world problem of connecting the social profile (Twitter) and academic profile (DBLP) of researchers. Experimental results show that our joint model achieves a 97% F1 score outperforming state-of-the-art results that consider profile, content or network features only.

AB  - This paper introduces a mechanism to recover traceability links between the requirements and logical models in the context of critical systems development. Currently, lifecycle processes are covered by a good number of tools that are used to generate different types of artifacts. One of the cornerstone capabilities in the development of critical systems lies in the possibility of automatically recovery traceability links between system artifacts generated in different lifecycle stages. To do so, it is necessary to establish to what extent two or more of these work products are similar, dependent or should be explicitly linked together. However, the different types of artifacts and their internal representation depict a major challenge to unify how system artifacts are represented and, then, linked together. That is why, in this work, a concept-based representation is introduced to provide a semantic and unified description of any system artifact. Furthermore, a traceability function is defined and implemented to exploit this new semantic representation and to support the recovery of traceability links between different types of system artifacts. In order to evaluate the traceability function, a case study in the railway domain is conducted to compare the precision and recall of recovery traceability links between text-based requirements and logical model elements. As the main outcome of this work, the use of a concept-based paradigm to represent that system artifacts are demonstrated as a building block to automatically recover traceability links within the development lifecycle of critical systems.

AB  - The aim of the study is to explore the intellectual structure of the field and fronts in research on energy efficiency in the context of cloud computing and thus to contribute to science mapping of the research field. The research process was driven by the following study questions: (1) what are the most influential publications in the research field? and (2) what are the research fronts in the research field? The method of direct citation analysis was employed in the research process. Data for analysis were obtained from the Scopus database and analyzed with the use of VOSviewer science mapping software. In response to the first question, we identified the most influential publications in the research field and analyzed their types (i.e., whether they are original research papers or rather the “context” papers e.g., survey or review papers, framework papers, challenges papers, and study papers). Moreover, a comparison analysis between the types of papers among the most cited “classical” publications and “emerging stars” was conducted. In response to the second research question, we identified five research fronts concentrated around the issues of: virtual machine management (“VM”); task-focus, concerning data replication, task consolidation, and task scheduling (“task”); energy efficiency (“energy”); modelling and optimization (“model”); and energy efficiency in the networking context (“network”).

AB  - The semi-automatic construction and analysis of technology roadmaps are at the forefront of applying artificial intelligence techniques. To clarify the development path of the core technologies in the field of agricultural machinery, we propose a core technology evolution path analysis method based on patent text semantic mining. First, the key sentences in the text were extracted, and the BERT model was used to represent the topic’s key sentences in semantic vectorization. Then, the technology roadmap was constructed through the unsupervised LDA topic clustering method, and the main fields of activity, blank fields, and fields of agricultural machinery were visually analyzed. Next, investment in research fields was strengthened. Finally, we mapped the technology roadmap and patent IPC codes and found that the evolution of core technologies in the field of agricultural machinery could be divided into the technology development stage, technology focus stage, and technology transformation stage; this allows us to analyze the evolution and integration of these core technologies. The internal laws of the technology evolution provide a reference for future research plans of governments, enterprises, and institutions, aiding in the patent portfolio planning by revealing the microlevel process of technology integration and the technological trends in agricultural machinery.

AB  - Abstract High-dimensional data analysis has become the most challenging task nowadays. Dimensionality reduction plays an important role here. It focuses on data features, which have proved their impact on accuracy, execution time, and space requirement. In this study, a dimensionality reduction method is proposed based on the convolution of input features. The experiments are carried out on minimal preprocessed nine benchmark datasets. Results show that the proposed method gives an average 38% feature reduction in the original dimensions. The algorithm accuracy is tested using the decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), and K -nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers and evaluated with the existing principal component analysis algorithm. The average increase in accuracy (Δ) is 8.06 for DT, 5.80 for SVM, and 18.80 for the KNN algorithm. The most significant characteristic feature of the proposed model is that it reduces attributes, leading to less computation time without loss in classifier accuracy.

AB  - Abstract NOTE: The first page of text has been automatically extracted and included below in lieu of an abstract DesignWebs: Towards the Creation of an Interactive Navigational Tool to assist and support Engineering Design Learning Abstract For both student and professional design teams, knowledge generated during the design process frequently goes uncaptured, and when it is captured, it is usually poorly organized and buried in obscure documents. The design and development process requires that collaborators build and retain knowledge through discussions, creating documents and sharing artifacts. Effective capture of both semantic knowledge and episodic knowledge can have many benefits for both student and professional design teams. The key to supporting these knowledge building problems is to develop an infrastructure that supports effective knowledge management. In this paper, we describe a framework for DesignWebs, which are dynamic, navigable networks of the documents and conversations created during the design process. A DesignWeb would enable users to see evolving connections between concepts by using a navigable web-based interface that synthesizes the design knowledge from multiple sources of information. Introduction Students working on engineering design projects bring together knowledge from different sources. They collaborate among themselves, share design knowledge, and negotiate with each other, faculty members and the client, in order to create engineering artifacts. This process often involves reuse of previous knowledge and the creation of new knowledge within the context of the problem. Such knowledge building is a key process skill that engineers need to acquire during their education. Ideally in team projects, students co-construct the knowledge necessary to realize their designs through the process of proposing, counter-proposing, questioning, arguing, agreeing, and dissenting. A major problem student teams face is learning how to organize and share ideas. This frequently results in “requirements deviations” where the interpretation of interactions by two or more team members may not only be different, but conflicting1. Detecting such problems as they occur has advantages for the team and implications on the project’s success. Actively engaging in navigating, searching and structuring knowledge as it is generated can improve the quality of knowledge sharing within groups, and possibly reduce the occurrence of requirements deviations. Students often find it difficult to locate the right piece of information from the e-mails, reference literature, discussion transcripts, status updates, time-sheets and final reports pertaining to a design project. The situation is complicated by the evolving nature of the decisions, leading to multiple versions of documents with contradictory information. Lack of support infrastructure to help locate the information embedded in documents related to an engineering artifact in real-time is a commonly experienced problem. Being novices in design, students also lack the perspective to structure and manage documents that they generate and use. Hence even the opportunity for them to recognize, formulate and solve problems cannot meet all the desired objectives and students often find it difficult to keep track of the design evolution.

AB  - This paper reviews the research on adaptive serious games for programming regarding the implementation of their support systems. Serious games are designed to educate players in an entertaining and engaging manner. A key element in terms of meeting their educational goals is the presentation of the learning content through a support system. Recent developments in artificial intelligence, data analysis, and computing made the development of support systems that adapt to player individual characteristics possible. A systematic literature review is necessary to evaluate the efficiency of adaptive supports and examine the implementation approaches. This review identified 18 papers reporting evidence about the efficiency of the provided support and methods of development. A variety of techniques for presenting educational content was found, with text being the preferred type. Researchers employed data-driven approaches to model student knowledge levels and behavior such as Bayesian networks and questionnaires, with fuzzy logic being utilized most frequently. The efficiency of the supports, when compared with non-adaptive or traditional methods of teaching, was mostly positive, although this is not a decisive conclusion. Some papers did not provide empirical evidence or concluded no difference in efficiency. The limited number of articles in the field, together with the lack of a standard evaluation methodology, leads to the conclusion that further work needs to be carried out in the area.

AB  - Technological Forecasting and Social Change (TFSC) is one of the main outlets in the literature on technological change. To assist its editors and future contributors in understanding the evolution of the journal, we review studies published between 1970 and 2022 identifying 25 main themes ranging from scenario foresight and forecasting methods that dominated the journal agenda in the first decades through innovation diffusion and patent analysis that gained popularity in 2006–2019 to social interaction and financial markets which experienced momentum in the last couple of years. We find that studies concentrated on more recent topics like firm performance, financial markets and environmental regulation have been cited more frequently and were contributed more often by scientists from China compared to the US. Inspired by the fact that studies recombining two or more topics are more impactful in terms of citations, we construct a graph of topics, both for the overall sample of 6240 studies reviewed and three periods of TFSC existence corresponding to different editors-in-chief. Our results illustrate knowledge complementarities explored in the journal so far and may indicate directions for further research.

AB  - Purpose/Thesis: Authors estimate the disciplinary similarity of researchers according to selected academic units with a different cross-section of specializations. The paper presents the model for studying disciplinary diversity of scientific units. The premise of the article is that knowledge of di­sciplinary profiles of researchers can be applied to create interdisciplinary teams, or one disciplinary team with a focused specializations.Approach/Methods: The approach is based on the visualization and comparison of disciplinary space and space of co-authorship. Fuzzy logic and aggregation norm were used to calculate disciplinary weights of each journal listed in the database. For visualization, new, dimension reduction algorithm t-SNE was applied. Achieved results were verified by using the expert’s knowledge.Results and conclusions: In the evaluation of scientific collaboration, a co-authorship relationship can be complemented by researchers’ disciplinary profiles represented by aggregation norm. Thanks to the continuity of researchers’ publishing activity, the proposed measure based on the disciplinary profile is stable.Research limitations: The sample of both selected teams and journals database is limited. The journals from WoS/Scopus list were considered because analyzed researchers publish articles there. Additionally, during linking these two databases, problems of matching journals titles appeared.Practical implications: The authors proposed a model of evaluating scientists’ disciplinary similarity and further, to estimate the potential of their collaboration.Originality/Value: This approach applies fuzzy logic algorithms to quantifying scientific interests and is another rare instance of practical application of artificial intelligence algorithms (fuzzy logic) in scientometric studies.

AB  - With the rapidly increasing amount of scientific literature, it is getting continuously more difficult for researchers in different disciplines to keep up-to-date with the recent findings in their field of study. Processing scientific articles in an automated fashion has been proposed as a solution to this problem, but the accuracy of such processing remains very poor for extraction tasks beyond the most basic ones (like locating and identifying entities and simple classification based on predefined categories). Few approaches have tried to change how we publish scientific results in the first place, such as by making articles machine-interpretable by expressing them with formal semantics from the start. In the work presented here, we propose a first step in this direction by setting out to demonstrate that we can formally publish high-level scientific claims in formal logic, and publish the results in a special issue of an existing journal. We use the concept and technology of nanopublications for this endeavor, and represent not just the submissions and final papers in this RDF-based format, but also the whole process in between, including reviews, responses, and decisions. We do this by performing a field study with what we call formalization papers, which contribute a novel formalization of a previously published claim. We received 15 submissions from 18 authors, who then went through the whole publication process leading to the publication of their contributions in the special issue. Our evaluation shows the technical and practical feasibility of our approach. The participating authors mostly showed high levels of interest and confidence, and mostly experienced the process as not very difficult, despite the technical nature of the current user interfaces. We believe that these results indicate that it is possible to publish scientific results from different fields with machine-interpretable semantics from the start, which in turn opens countless possibilities to radically improve in the future the effectiveness and efficiency of the scientific endeavor as a whole.

We focus on a number of important topics in this field, including the evolvement of STEAM and critical making as well as the process of redefining learning spaces in the transformation of the mathematics classroom. We also address the increasing use of computer algebra systems and dynamic geometry packages; and the issue of student collaboration online, especially using learning environments and social media. We briefly touch on artificial intelligence systems, including hyper-personalisation of learning, multimodality and videos. We include a brief discussion on the impact of COVID-19 on mathematics education, and lastly on the more theoretical perspective of the epistemology of digital technology and the construct of humans-with-media. We conclude the discussion with some possible concerns and mentioning some possible new topics for research in the field.

AB  - The paper is devoted to the problem of the bibliometric study of publications on the topic “Cross-lingual Semantic Similarity”, available in the Dimensions database. Visualization of scientific networks showed fragmentation of research, limited interaction of organizations. Leading countries, leading organizations and authors are highlighted. Overlay visualization allowed us to assess the trends in citing authors. The expansion of the geography of research is shown. For international cooperation, the uniformity of semantic approaches to describing the concepts of critical infrastructure, incidents, resources and services related to their maintenance and protection is important. The stated approaches can be applied for visualization and modeling of technological development in the modern digital world. Semantic similarity is a longstanding problem in natural language processing (NLP). The semantic similarity between two words represents the semantic proximity (or semantic distance) between two words or concepts. This is an important problem in natural language processing, as it plays an important role in finding information, extracting information, text mining, web mining and many other applications.

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of public procurement documents in the domain of university buildings taken from the e-procurement platform, particularly focusing on their transformation towards more efficient energy consumption. Using a corpus of the titles of the public procurement documents from 2020 to 2022, we used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling to understand the key thematic areas of focus. The methodology presented in this study incorporated a bifurcated approach. This two-stage procedure began with preprocessing and dictionary creation from the corpus of titles of procurement documents. Following this, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model was employed for topic extraction and trend analysis, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of the thematic progression in procurement practices over time. Our analysis revealed a shift in emphasis from modernization towards the adoption of energy-saving technologies as well as a growing focus on broader sustainability initiatives. However, a less prevalent topic was adherence to cooling &amp; heating systems, suggesting potential areas for improvement in procurement practices. These findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge on sustainable procurement in university buildings and offer valuable insight for universities to enhance their energy efficiency strategies.

AB  - Under the development of interdisciplinary fusion, user research has been greatly influenced by technology-driven neuroscience and sensory science, in terms of thinking and methodology. The use of technical methods, such as EEG and eye-tracking, has gradually become a research trend and hotspot in this field, in order to explore the deep cognitive states behind users’ objective behaviors. This review outlines the applications of EEG and eye-tracking technology in the field of user research, with the aim of promoting future research and proposing reliable reference indicators and a research scope. It provides important reference information for other researchers in the field. The article summarizes the key reference indicators and research paradigms of EEG and eye-tracking in current user research, focusing on the user research situation in industrial products, digital interfaces and spatial environments. The limitations and research trends in current technological applications are also discussed. The feasibility of experimental equipment in outdoor environments, the long preparation time of EEG experimental equipment, and the accuracy error of physiological signal acquisition are currently existing problems. In the future, research on multi-sensory and behavioral interactions and universal studies of multiple technology fusions will be the next stage of research topics. The measurement of different user differentiation needs can be explored by integrating various physiological measurements such as EEG signals and eye-tracking signals, skin electrical signals, respiration, and heart rate.

AB  - As a prominent component of the construction field of sponge cities, ecological concrete is an essential tool to reach the goals of green, low-carbon living and sustainable development. A quantitative summary of the preliminary research on ecological concrete infrastructure in sponge city architecture is needed. Therefore, CiteSpace and VOSviewer were applied to perform a comparative analysis of the number of papers, countries, institutions, core authors, literature co-citations, research hotspots, and future trends in ecological concrete in the sponge city construction industry. The results show that the number of papers on ecological concrete is increasing, the research collaboration between domestic and foreign authors is relatively single, and there is insufficient interdisciplinary integration between institutions and the phenomenon of “relatively independent research.” The number of papers published in the field of ecological concrete construction has been on the rise, reaching more than 100 in each of the last 10 years, with China and the United States contributing more to the scientific output of the field. To meet the needs of global environmental protection and resource conservation, the theme of “promoting comprehensive resource conservation and recycling” will continue in the future, making concrete a feature of green, low-carbon, sustainable development and other areas of environmental protection in the construction field.

AB  - The need to demonstrate the impact of research has become an important issue in the Higher Education sector in the UK. This has been taken care of through the introduction of ‘impact case studies’ as part of the research excellence framework (REF). The aim of the study presented in this paper was to understand the role that educational technology (and related terms) played in the 2014 REF impact case studies, using the public online database of case studies as a data source. Searches for 11 educational technology-related terms yielded a sample of 125 unique case studies. Although this represents only 1.9% of the total case studies, educational technology is clearly playing a role. The cases comprised two major subgroups: those where educational technology was the focus of the research (mainly associated with cases in education and computer science), and those where educational technology was used as a route to achieving impact (mainly in health-related subjects). The findings have implications for the contributions that educational technology and educational technologists can make in enhancing and supporting this important issue within their institutions.

AB  - Abstract Purpose Assess whether ChatGPT 4.0 is accurate enough to perform research evaluations on journal articles to automate this time-consuming task. Design/methodology/approach Test the extent to which ChatGPT-4 can assess the quality of journal articles using a case study of the published scoring guidelines of the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021 to create a research evaluation ChatGPT. This was applied to 51 of my own articles and compared against my own quality judgements. Findings ChatGPT-4 can produce plausible document summaries and quality evaluation rationales that match the REF criteria. Its overall scores have weak correlations with my self-evaluation scores of the same documents (averaging r=0.281 over 15 iterations, with 8 being statistically significantly different from 0). In contrast, the average scores from the 15 iterations produced a statistically significant positive correlation of 0.509. Thus, averaging scores from multiple ChatGPT-4 rounds seems more effective than individual scores. The positive correlation may be due to ChatGPT being able to extract the author’s significance, rigour, and originality claims from inside each paper. If my weakest articles are removed, then the correlation with average scores (r=0.200) falls below statistical significance, suggesting that ChatGPT struggles to make fine-grained evaluations. Research limitations The data is self-evaluations of a convenience sample of articles from one academic in one field. Practical implications Overall, ChatGPT does not yet seem to be accurate enough to be trusted for any formal or informal research quality evaluation tasks. Research evaluators, including journal editors, should therefore take steps to control its use. Originality/value This is the first published attempt at post-publication expert review accuracy testing for ChatGPT.

AB  - Abstract In view of the celebration of the ‘International Year of Millets,’ millets are popularizing sustainable agricultural output amid challenging climates and nourishing adequately as food and feed. The extent of scientific intervention is the foundation for designing, promoting and popularizing neglected crops on social platforms. Planning future directions and adaptive strategies largely require regular evaluation of research efforts to identify hotspots and research gaps, as identified in the present study by creating a robust text-mining approach that integrates scientometrics using PubMed citation data. Keyword mining reveals that India and China are the leading publication centres on millets, possibly due to their large proportion of cultivation and indigenous nature. It further reveals that the pearl millet is the predominant one, followed by foxtail and finger millet, suggesting that most research is confined to them only; however, other millets, still have a research gap in comparison. The word abiotic stress is associated with high frequency in millet research due to its adaptive nature amid climate change. Thematic representation explored the novel concept of millet's utility as a probiotic and millet bran to ensure nutrient–cereal properties based on the persistency of keywords throughput research progression; however, incurious consumption is associated with harmful ochratoxin. Bio-concept mining and knowledge graph generation divided the millet research output into four large domains, which provides a largely covered bio-concepts for millet research and co-concurrence of emerging bio-concepts to intense progress and finds an adequate literature gap to improve millet research for sustained growth and equilibrate biodiversity.

AB  - Scientific spaces research is a complex task that must take into account the dynamics of the development of their components, as well as account for the numerous changes that result from the increase in the speed of information production and its dissemination. The analysis of the associations of subjects and objects of the scientific space, including networks of scientific cooperation, citation networks and joint citation, is an urgent task of the research since it is the basis for the correct evaluation of their R&D indicators. The paper gives an overview of the problems arising in the analysis of scientific networks: research of scientific cooperation networks, research of citation networks, joint citation and bibliographic connections, identification of directions of scientific research and analysis of topics, construction of scientific networks based on common keywords, research of heterogeneous scientific networks. The globalization of the dissemination and the dynamics of the scientific network's development determine the approaches to their analysis. Study of scientific networks allows to understand the structure of interaction of subjects and objects of scientific networks (scientists, HEI and their structural divisions), as well as to conduct a thorough evaluation of their research activities. The paper presents a visualization of the scientific cooperation network within the framework of the implementation of four budget research topics and one Erasmus + KA2 project for the period from 2015 to 2020. The visualization performed using the power algorithm of the Fruchterman-Rheingold viewing. The citation network of scientists's publications based on the Yifan Hu visualization algorithm was presented. The results of the evaluation can be used both by scientists and educational institutions to monitor the dynamics of research activities. In particular, the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine, as well as by local self-government bodies, to financially stimulate specific areas of research that have positive dynamics and development prospects.

AB  - Innovation has been the transforming tool of precision agriculture as a response to population growth and the demand for more food with quality, less waste, food security, and sustainable management of environmental resources. The challenges are to increase the productivity of cultivated areas, both for current and future areas, to manage the use of potable water, scarce in many regions, to keep the soil fertile, and to reduce waste through reuse, optimization, resource sharing, and operational and strategic management based on accurate information of planting, harvesting, and management of environmental conditions, which are also objectives of the Circular Economy. Therefore, using Industry 4.0 technologies in agriculture becomes fundamental to facing such challenges. This paper presents a systematic literature review on Industry 4.0 technologies adopted in agriculture for sustainable development, considering environmental, economic, and social benefits. The research pointed to the use of IoT in irrigation control systems by sending automatic commands, monitoring soil and weather conditions, in the use of machinery with some automation features and in cloud data storage systems, and with the use of Big Data analytical tools, with access by mobile devices, these uses contribute to operational and strategic decision making in the management of planting and harvesting. However, the literature review did not find a technological architecture for Integrated Services in Agriculture 4.0. Thus, this paper proposes a Service Architecture that enables the promotion of a Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0. The contribution of this article to the theory is in the expansion of knowledge of the use of technologies in Agriculture 4.0. In terms of practice, this article provides an Integrated Service Architecture so that new products can be developed for Agriculture 4.0 and thus contribute to society in reducing food insecurity, generating environmental, economic, and social benefits, and promoting the Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0.

AB  - One of the most important scientific activities in which business process management (BPM) research attempts have been presented is the BPM Conferences that have been organized since 2003. These conferences guide the future of the field concerning different aspects of the subject. This study focuses on the accumulated literature that BPM conferences have constituted. In this regard, it aims to investigate the portfolio of BPM conferences to pinpoint the trends that have been followed over the years. A bibliometric dataset of the proceedings between 2005 and 2020 was extracted. The methods of scientometrics and bibliometrics are adopted to reveal the collaborations and clusters regarding citations, co-authorships, co-occurrences of keywords, and topic structures, the trends, and summary statistics. Clusters have emerged around certain authors and these authors are pioneering researchers who direct international studies on BPM and have created many research and development opportunities with their research laboratories. The situation in author relations is also reflected in the statistics of institutions and countries. With the keyword and abstract analyses at different depths and dimensions, inferences were made about the topics discussed at the BPM Conferences. Co-authorship analyses regarding authors and countries revealed the clusters around the authors and their countries such as Van der Aalst (Netherlands), Mendling (Austria), Weske (Germany), Dumas (Estonia), La Rossa (Australia), and Reijers (Netherlands). It has been observed that the keywords that have been recorded intensively in the last five years are concentrated around the topics of industry 4.0, big data, internet of things, blockchain, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. In general terms, it has been observed that especially the topics such as process mining, semantic structures of processes, business process execution language, and related projects have come to the fore. Findings emphasize that these topics have been affected by the business and technology dynamics of the relevant period.

AB  - Diversity is a concept relevant to numerous domains of research varying from ecology, to information theory, and to economics, to cite a few. It is a notion that is steadily gaining attention in the information retrieval, network analysis, and artificial neural networks communities. While the use of diversity measures in network-structured data counts a growing number of applications, no clear and comprehensive description is available for the different ways in which diversities can be measured. In this article, we develop a formal framework for the application of a large family of diversity measures to heterogeneous information networks (HINs), a flexible, widely-used network data formalism. This extends the application of diversity measures, from systems of classifications and apportionments, to more complex relations that can be better modeled by networks. In doing so, we not only provide an effective organization of multiple practices from different domains, but also unearth new observables in systems modeled by heterogeneous information networks. We illustrate the pertinence of our approach by developing different applications related to various domains concerned by both diversity and networks. In particular, we illustrate the usefulness of these new proposed observables in the domains of recommender systems and social media studies, among other fields.

AB  - Intelligent user interfaces (IUI) are driven by the goal of improvement in human–computer interaction (HCI), mainly improving user interfaces’ user experience (UX) or usability with the help of artificial intelligence. The main goal of this study is to find, assess, and synthesize existing state-of-the-art work in the field of IUI with an additional focus on the evaluation of IUI. This study analyzed 211 studies published in the field between 2012 and 2022. Studies are most frequently tied to HCI and SE domains. Definitions of IUI were observed, showing that adaptation, representation, and intelligence are key characteristics associated with IUIs, whereas adaptation, reasoning, and representation are the most commonly used verbs in their description. Evaluation of IUI is mainly conducted with experiments and questionnaires, though usability and UX are not considered together in evaluations. Most evaluations (81% of studies) reported partial or complete improvement in usability or UX. A shortage of evaluation tools, methods, and metrics, tailored for IUI, is noticed. Most often, empirical data collection methods and data sources in IUI evaluation studies are experiment, prototype development, and questionnaire.

AB  - Background: Mapping scientific trends is one of the most important missions of scientometric research for effective research. The main goal of this paper was to visualize and draw the intellectual and cognitive structures of information retrieval (IR) in the medical sciences using science mapping. Methods: In this cross-sectional scientometric study, we recruited all documents indexed in the Web of Science database with the topic of storing and retrieval of information in medical sciences. To analyze the results, 3 software, SciMAT-v1.1.04, VOSviewer-v1.6.14, CitNetExplorer_v1.0.0, were used. Results: Our results showed that most scientific productions in this field fall into 2 categories: (1) effective methods of organizing information and (2) application and operation of the IR system in the process of intelligent questioning and answering, and analyzing information behaviors of physicians and health professionals. The results showed that the similarity index increased over time from 0.43 to 0.71. Analysis of the findings showed that similarity measures, expert systems, concepts, experience, answers, and multimodel IR clusters were considered as mature and completely centralized clusters in the first quarter of the strategic chart. Conclusion: Because of the dramatic approximation of the vocabulary used by researchers and a relative slowdown in the growth rate of the subject's domain in the last decade, it seems necessary to pay attention to the expansion of the fields of IR and the application of its concepts in medical information sciences. Also, it can be recommended that designers of IR systems and techniques in medical information sciences pay more attention to human factors attentively to develop new technologies and tools.

AB  - &lt;b&gt;Introduction:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) has made a big difference and is used in many different sectors also in medicine. We sought to identify the areas of interest and potential future directions for AI in the field of colonoscopy imaging and colonic diseases by utilizing bibliometrics to analyze the previous 50 years' worth of changes on this topic.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Material and methods:&lt;/b&gt; Using the Web of Knowledge (WOS) database, we searched for articles published from 1970 to 2021 using the keywords related to colonoscopy imaging/colonic diseases and AI.&amp;nbsp; The retrieved articles were analysed with bibliometric methods.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; A total of 278 documents were analyzed in this study. The earliest article was published in 1997 and the vast majority of the documents were published in 2021 (n=81). There was a growth in publications number in the last 5 years. The documents were cited 3054 times in total and had 10.99 citations per document. The main Hirsch (H) index of the documents was 27. A total of 41 countries contributed to the literature. The United States of America (USA), the People’s Republic of China, and England were the leading countries on this topic. Also, England had the highest number of citations (total of 974 citations, 31.42 per document) and the USA publications had the highest H index.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Discussion: &lt;/b&gt;Artificial intelligence facilitates diagnosis and treatment possibilities, especially in the field of health. Especially the use of artificial intelligence in colonoscopic imaging reduces the risk of missing a possible polyp or a mucosal pathology. The integration of artificial intelligence into imaging methods has been the most in the last 5 years. Most studies on this subject have been done in the USA.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; Our research may offer a historical perspective on the development of AI in colorectal diseases. The documents were limited to some developing countries.

AB  - Background: Consecutive Clustering is one type of learning method that is built on neural network. It is frequently used in different domains including biomedical research. It is very useful for consecutive clustering (adjacent clustering). Adjacent clustering is highly used where there are various specific locations or addresses denoting each individual features in the data that need to be grouped consecutively. One of the useful consecutive clustering in the field of biomedical research is differentially methylated region (DMR) finding analysis on various CpG sites (features). Method: So far, many researches have been carried out on deep learn- ing and consecutive clustering in biomedical domain. But for epigenetics study, very limited survey papers have been published till now where con- secutive clustering has been demonstrated together. Hence, in this study, we contributed a comprehensive survey on several fundamental categories of consecutive clustering, e.g., Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) Auto- Encoder (AE), Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and Deep Belief Net- work (DBN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Deep Stacking Networks (DSN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) / Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Network etc., along with their applications, advantages and disadvantages. Different forms of consecutive clustering algorithms are covered in the second section (viz., supervised and unsupervised DMR finding methods) used for DNA methylation data have been described here along with their advantages, shortcomings and overall performance estimation (power, time). Conclusion: Our survey paper provides a latest research work that have been done for consecutive clustering algorithms for healthcare purposes. All the usages, benefits and shortcomings along with their performance evaluation of each algorithm has been elaborated in our manuscript by which new biomedical researchers can understand and use those tools and algorithms for their research prospective.

AB  - This article describes a new bibliometric indicator called Impact Factor of a Term (IFT) that helps to predict future impact of scientific works and/or the author. The predictive properties of IFT are proven by two examples of different collections of scientific articles. It is shown that the correlations of the current and future IFT values depending on the trend are practically similar for both collections. The graphs of IFT correlations of the current and future years depending on the number of articles with the word/term are presented. The graphs show that the higher the current frequency of the term and the number of articles with this term, the greater the correlation and stability of IFT. The stability of IFT helps to accurately predict the number of future citations. The list of the most informative words/terms with the largest total values of IFT multiplied by the current frequency is analyzed. It has been shown that the size of collection affects the stability and predictive properties of IFT. The words and terms with high IFT values allow us to judge the future impact of an article and its author based on the prediction of future citations. Such words also help identify promising research directions.

AB  - Applications for human sensing, also known as (human) occupancy detection, include energy management systems for intelligent buildings, intruder detection, e-health systems, the identification of everyday activity, and the monitoring of vital signs. These applications require intelligent decision-making that relies on human sensing. Multiple technologies based on vision, sensors, or radio signals can be used to detect occupancy. Vision-based systems use a multitude of cameras to recognize the human presence, but they are restricted by light availability, line-of-sight coverage, expensive equipment, and privacy concerns. Sensor-based techniques refer to a prospective method that employs various combinations of sensors. These solutions are static and necessitate costly equipment installation and maintenance. Due to technical advancements, radio-based signals, such as WiFi, have been integrated into various forms of infrastructure, including homes, offices, and constructions. Due to how human body movements affect wireless signal propagation, it is possible to detect human motions by analyzing the received wireless signals (such as reflection, diffraction, and scattering). Due to its low cost and non-intrusive nature, wireless-based human activity detection has received substantial attention and become a key topic of study. This article reviews the underlying principles, methodologies, and system architectures of radio-frequency-based occupancy detection systems. We classify the reviewed research studies based on the technical measures and applications they employ. In addition to focusing on the security aspects of occupancy detection and discussing future trends and difficulties, we also discuss practical considerations.

AB  - Since the 1990s, the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis posits an inverted U-shaped relationship between pollutants and economic development.The hypothesis has attracted a lot of research.We provide here a review of more than 2000 articles that have been published on the EKC.We aim at mapping the development of this specialized research, both in term of actors and of content, and to trace the transformation it has undergone from its beginning to the present.To that end, we combine traditional bibliometric analysis and semantic analysis with a novel method, that enables us to recover the type of pollutants that are studied and the empirical claims made on EKC (whether the hypothesis is invalidated or not).We principally exhibit the existence of a few epistemic communities that are related to distinct time periods, topics and, to some extent, proportion of positive results on EKC.

AB  - Balancing efficiency and resilience in any supply chain commences from its ability to secure supplier networks. Blockchain technology applications in procurement can work as a major enabler in this process. Despite the unquestionable relevance of Blockchain Technology (BCT)-integrated Procurement, no comprehensive review exists. Considering this significant research gap, the present study aims to provide a comprehensive literature review by deeply examining 95 highly relevant papers published from January 2012 to Sep 2023. Existing literature studies suggest BCT as the imitable enabler of the Procurement 4.0 era, yet the topic has not been fully explored and researched. This study identifies noteworthy deficits in theoretical underpinnings, technological contributions in generating new revenue models, radical impacts anticipated on the procurement organization restructuring, and so forth. The research is timely and importantly advantageous because it offers a holistic view of relevant literature-driven evidence about a range of existing dimensions on the subject. More specifically, this study provides exhaustive key recommendations for future research on BCT applications in procurement utilizing the Theory, Context, and Methodology (TCM) framework.

AB  - Background The digitalization of medicine is becoming a transformative force in modern healthcare systems. This study aims to investigate discussions regarding patient safety, as well as summarize perceived approaches to mitigating risks of adverse events expressed through the #PatientSafety Twitter hashtag during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This research is grounded in the analysis of data extracted from Twitter under the hashtag #PatientSafety between December 1, 2019 and February 1, 2023. Symplur Signals, which represents a tool offering a method to monitor tweets containing hashtags registered with the Symplur Healthcare Hashtag Project, was used for analyzing the tweets shared in the study period. For text analytics of the relevant data, we further used the word cloud generator MonkeyLearn, and VOSviewer. Results The analysis encompasses 358′809 tweets that were shared by 90′079 Twitter users, generating a total of 1′183’384′757 impressions. Physicians contributed to 18.65% of all tweets, followed by other healthcare professionals (14.31%), and health-focused individuals (10.91%). Geographically, more than a third of tweets (60.90%) were published in the United States. Canada and India followed in second and third positions, respectively. Blocks of trending terms of greater interest to the global Twitter community within the hashtag #PatientSafety were determined to be: “Patient,” “Practical doctors,” and “Health Care Safety Management.” The findings demonstrate the engagement of the Twitter community with COVID-19 and problems related to the training, experience of doctors and patients during a pandemic, communication, the vaccine safety and effectiveness, and potential use of off-label drugs. Noteworthy, in the field of pharmacovigilance, Twitter has the possibility of identifying adverse reactions associated with the use of drugs, including vaccines. The issue of medical errors has been also discussed by Twitter users using the hashtag #PatientSafety. Conclusion It is clear that various stakeholders, including students, medical practitioners, health organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and regulatory bodies, leverage Twitter to rapidly exchange medical information, data on the disease symptoms, and the drug effects. Consequently, there is a need to further integrate Twitter-derived data into the operational routines of healthcare organizations.

AB  - The existing approaches to identification of emerging technologies create a prominent opportunity for technology convergence and market growth potential. However, existing approaches either suffer from the time lag issue or have yet to explorethe assessment’s uncertainty and ambiguity. Based on a total of 14 years of mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) activity data in the Health Care sector, the complex patterns between growth velocity and accelerating of M&amp;A activities are analyzed with two quantitative indicators (Promising Index and Promising Index Sharpe Ratio) to identify emerging technological opportunities. The proposed integrative approach offers a mean to resolve the time lag issue, deal with market trend irregularity, and manage expectations of investors for emerging technology and industry. Specifically, this study aims to (i) provide a decision support system integrating M&amp;A activity information for strategic investment planning and (ii) identify promising technologies in the Healthcare sector to manage the irregularities of market trend and investment outcome. This study is one of the first research that employs a prior data-based approach to delineate emerging technologies by analyzing the growth momentum properties of specific industry areas based on the M&amp;A activity data.

AB  - Over the past few years, numerous studies and research articles have been published in the medical literature review domain. The topics covered by these researches included medical information retrieval, disease statistics, drug analysis, and many other fields and application domains. In this paper, we employ various text mining and data analysis techniques in an attempt to discover trending topics and topic concordance in the healthcare literature and data mining field. This analysis focuses on healthcare literature and bibliometric data and word association rules applied to 1945 research articles that had been published between the years 2006 and 2019. Our aim in this context is to assist saving time and effort required for manually summarizing large-scale amounts of information in such a broad and multi-disciplinary domain. To carry out this task, we employ topic modeling techniques through the utilization of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), in addition to various document and word embedding and clustering approaches. Findings reveal that since 2010 the interest in the healthcare big data analysis has increased significantly, as demonstrated by the five most commonly used topics in this domain.

AB  - Comparing text documents is an essential task for a variety of applications within diverse research fields, and several different methods have been developed for this. However, calculating text similarity is an ambiguous and context-dependent task, so many open challenges still exist. In this paper, we present a novel method for text similarity calculations based on the combination of embedding technology and ensemble methods. By using several embeddings, instead of only one, we show that it is possible to achieve higher quality, which in turn is a key factor for developing high-performing applications for text similarity exploitation. We also provide a prototype visual analytics tool which helps the analyst to find optimal performing ensembles and gain insights to the inner workings of the similarity calculations. Furthermore, we discuss the generalizability of our key ideas to fields beyond the scope of text analysis.

AB  - The literature on neuroscience has grown rapidly in recent years with the emergence of new domains of research. In the context of this progress, creating a knowledge organization system (KOS) that can quickly incorporate terms of a given domain is an important aim in the area. In this article, we develop a systematic method based on word representation and the agglomerative clustering algorithm to semi-automatically build a hierarchical KOS. We collected 35,832 research keywords and 11,497 research methods from PubMed Central database, and organized them in a hierarchical structure according to semantic distance. We show that the proposed KOS can help find terms related to the given topics, analyze articles related to specific domains of research, and characterize the features of article clusters. The proposed method can significantly reduce the manual work required by experts to organize the KOS.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a remarkable surge in the development and research of tethered aerial systems, thus reflecting a growing interest in their diverse applications. Long-term missions involving aerial vehicles present significant challenges due to the limitations of current battery solutions. Tethered vehicles can circumvent such restrictions by receiving their power from an element on the ground such as a ground station or a mobile terrestrial platform. Tethered Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can also be applied to load transportation achieved by a single or multiple UAVs. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic literature review, with a special focus on solutions published in the last five years (2017–2022). It emphasizes the key characteristics that are capable of grouping publications by application scope, propulsion method, energy transfer solution, perception sensors, and control techniques adopted. The search was performed in six different databases, thereby resulting in 1172 unique publications, from which 182 were considered for inclusion in the data extraction phase of this review. Among the various aircraft types, multirotors emerged as the most widely used category. We also identified significant variations in the application scope of tethered UAVs, thus leading to tailored approaches for each use case, such as the fixed-wing model being predominant in the wind generation application and the lighter-than-air aircraft in the meteorology field. Notably, the classical Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID) control scheme emerged as the predominant control methodology across the surveyed publications. Regarding energy transfer techniques, most publications did not explicitly describe their approach. However, among those that did, high-voltage DC energy transfer emerged as the preferred solution. In summary, this systematic literature review provides valuable insights into the current state of tethered aerial systems, thereby showcasing their potential as a robust and sustainable alternative to address the challenges associated with long-duration aerial missions and load transportation.

AB  - Traditional co-word networks do not discriminate keywords of researcher interest from general keywords. Co-word networks are therefore often too general to provide knowledge if interest to domain experts. Inspired by the recent work that uses an automatic method to identify the questions of interest to researchers like “problems” and “solutions”, we try to answer a similar question “what sensors can be used for what kind of applications”, which is great interest in sensor- related fields. By generalizing the specific questions as “questions of interest”, we built a knowledge network considering researcher interest, called bipartite network of interest (BNOI). Different from a co-word approaches using accurate keywords from a list, BNOI uses classification models to find possible entities of interest. A total of nine feature extraction methods including N-grams, Word2Vec, BERT, etc. were used to extract features to train the classification models, including naïve Bayes (NB), support vector machines (SVM) and logistic regression (LR). In addition, a multi-feature fusion strategy and a voting principle (VP) method are applied to assemble the capability of the features and the classification models. Using the abstract text data of 350 remote sensing articles, features are extracted and the models trained. The experiment results show that after removing the biased words and using the ten-fold cross-validation method, the F-measure of “sensors” and “applications” are 93.2% and 85.5%, respectively. It is thus demonstrated that researcher questions of interest can be better answered by the constructed BNOI based on classification results, comparedwith the traditional co-word network approach.

AB  - By reviewing scientific literature, researchers may obtain a comprehensive understanding of field developments, keeping abreast of the current research status and hotspot shifts. The evolution pattern of keywords is supposed to be an efficient indicator in revealing the shifting and sustainability configuration of scientific concepts, ideas, and research hotspots. Here we take an extensive investigation of the evolution of keywords among all publications in PNAS Social Sciences from 1990 to 2021. Statistical tests show the keyword mention time series always accompanied by the emergence of a log-normal distribution. Additionally, we introduce a novel schema of four patterns (TELS), which are Transient impact type, Explosive impact type, Large impact type, and Small impact type, respectively, to illustrate the evolution of keywords. The TELS schema can be used to capture the whole life circle feature of any proposed keyword, from a pool of candidates. By dividing the entire time into four periods, we also introduce the concept of elite keywords to reveal the temporal feature of social sciences focus. An explicit transition from anthropology research to neuroscience and social problems research can be observed from the evolution diagram. We argue that the proposed method is of general sense and might be applicable to other fields of science.

AB  - Earthquake Disaster Assessment (EDA) plays a critical role in earthquake disaster prevention, evacuation, and rescue efforts. Deep learning (DL), which boasts advantages in image processing, signal recognition, and object detection, has facilitated scientific research in EDA. This paper analyses 204 articles through a systematic literature review to investigate the status quo, development, and challenges of DL for EDA. The paper first examines the distribution characteristics and trends of the two categories of EDA assessment objects, including earthquakes and secondary disasters as disaster objects, buildings, infrastructure, and areas as physical objects. Next, this study analyses the application distribution, advantages, and disadvantages of the three types of data (remote sensing data, seismic data, and social media data) mainly involved in these studies. Furthermore, the review identifies the characteristics and application of six commonly used DL models in EDA, including convolutional neural network (CNN), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), recurrent neural network (RNN), generative adversarial network (GAN), transfer learning (TL), and hybrid models. The paper also systematically details the application of DL for EDA at different times (i.e., pre-earthquake stage, during-earthquake stage, post-earthquake stage, and multi-stage). We find that the most extensive research in this field involves using CNNs for image classification to detect and assess building damage resulting from earthquakes. Finally, the paper discusses challenges related to training data and DL models, and identifies opportunities in new data sources, multimodal DL, and new concepts. This review provides valuable references for scholars and practitioners in related fields.

AB  - The degree of matching between supply and demand for financial support policies is a key factor for policy effectiveness. In this paper, we use policy text computing method that integrates topic mining, text classification, and training set predictions to study the supply and demand matching of China’s financial support policies for private enterprises. We find that supply and demand match for policies on diversified financing channels. However, there is mismatch in financial service facilitation policies and local subsidy policies. Our research implies that China’s development of a multiple-layer financial market has promoted the diversification of financing channels, which has improved the financing conditions for private enterprises. However, financial service network is still not convenient to facilitate private enterprises.

AB  - To investigate the advancements of artificial intelligence techniques in the realm of library and information subject, we have chosen the Latent Dirichlet Allocation method as a case study to explore its current study status and implementations. Traditional theme mining analyses utilize methods such as word frequency statistics, co-occurrence analysis, community detection, and citation analysis to capture external quantitative features of words or documents. In contrast, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation theme modelling method employs a three-layer Bayesian structure of document-topic-word to describe the themes of documents and the semantic relationships among words, enabling a better exploration of latent semantic information in text. This method plays a pivotal role in fine-grained knowledge extraction and analysis. We systematically review more than a decade of relevant literature in the realm about library and information subject. Through content analysis, we construct an analytical architecture for the implementation of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation method. This architecture, viewed from the perspective of the implementation process of Latent Dirichlet Allocation, comprehensively summarizes the core stages and technical challenges, including text pre-processing, model construction (i.e., theme model selection and optimal theme number determination), and model solving. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current study status of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation method across various implementation domains, such as theme exploration, knowledge organization, academic evaluation, sentiment analysis, and recommendation study. Our findings indicate that the Latent Dirichlet Allocation method has formed a mature analytical process in the realm of library and information subject, with ongoing growth in study interest.

AB  - This work aims to analyse the state of the art of accounting and management control practices in companies that follow an e-commerce strategy. The methodology comprises a systematic literature review of the scientific production, from 2000 to 2023, in the Web of Science database. Using bibliometric techniques, temporal evolution and prominent authors, institutions, journals, and countries were identified, and the citation network was analysed. This research also analyses the structural knowledge groups and the scientific production specifically focused on accounting and e-commerce. Eighty-nine articles were analysed, most published between 2019 and 2023, with 2022 being the most evident and notable year in the number of articles published. The analysis shows that relatively few studies published in the last two decades focused on the importance of accounting and e-commerce, with a growing trend in recent years. The increased interest in studying the importance of e-commerce can be explained by the strategic role of a company in becoming innovative and more efficient and, on the other hand, the global pandemic experienced three years ago forced companies to adjust their business model. The keywords most used in the analysed studies align with this assumption. This document provides support and guidance for new researchers on this topic.

AB  - Internal swelling reactions (ISRs) are among the most critical deterioration mechanisms affecting infrastructure’s durability worldwide. While preventative measures for new structures have been extensively explored, effective protocols for diagnosing and prognosing ISR-affected structures, especially at their early stages, are still required. Therefore, through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis, this study focuses on exploring the evolution and current methods for assessing and forecasting ISR damage in concrete structures. For diagnosis, a shift from concrete petrography and non-destructive techniques (NDTs) towards more comprehensive methods (i.e., multi-level assessment) with the stiffness damage test (SDT) and damage rating index (DRI) is observed. Moreover, it identifies the valuable inputs from residual expansion and pore solution analysis as relevant parameters for prognosis. Based on these findings, a structured management framework is proposed aiming to refine the diagnosis and prognosis processes of ISR-affected infrastructure, ultimately contributing to improved long-term structural health and maintenance strategies.

AB  - Abstract This paper presents a dataset construction and data science analysis from the literature results of physicochemical characterization of ordinary Portland cement (OPC). The physicochemical variables included the percentage by mass of calcium oxide (CaO), silicon dioxide (SiO2), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), iron oxide (Fe2O3), magnesium oxide (MgO), sulfuric oxide (SO3), sodium oxide (Na2O), potassium oxide (K2O), titanium oxide (TiO2), free lime (CaOfree), equivalent alkaline (Na2Oeq), loss on ignition, specific surface, density, water-cement ratio, and compressive strength of cement at 28 days. The searching, collection, and assembly of the dataset aimed to evaluate the information related to those variables through exploratory data analysis, enabling a basic understanding of characterization results of OPCs obtained in publications from different types, sources, years, and countries. The dataset provides a useful source of physicochemical characterization of ordinary cement, and the exploratory data analysis provided an understanding of central, dispersion, and data distribution with statistical metrics of each variable and their pair-wise correlations in the assembled dataset. The constructed dataset and its analysis are a starting point to further data, studies, and artificial intelligence models to provide a broader global view of the production and properties of ordinary Portland cement.

AB  - Computational social science, as an emerging interdisciplinary discipline, is a field ushered in by long-term development of traditional social science. It is committed to supplying data thinking, resources, and analytics to study human social behavior and social operation laws to accurately grasp and judge the developing path of the discipline, which is of great significance to promote the innovation and development of social sciences. This study is to conduct a systematic quantitative analysis from a bibliometric perspective, aiming to provide a reference for scholars to explore the paths and changing rules in the field. We use the relevant literature in Web of Science as the dataset. After eliminating journal calls and irrelevant literature, R language and SciMAT tools are used to visualize and analyze the number of articles, keyword clustering, keyword cooccurrence network, and theme evolution, so as to summarize and sort out the paths of computational social science research. The study found that the annual volume of publications has been gradually increasing and will probably remain active in the next few years with high productivity. Subject themes in different periods are diversified, and the evolutionary relationship is found complex as well. Besides, as a cross discipline, scientific knowledge from different fields cross collides and couples with each other in the big data environment, changing the traditional concept of computational social science and forming a new development path. Recently, the emergence of “big data+” has promoted the rise of new subject areas, making the development of new disciplines a reality.

AB  - Cybersecurity research includes several areas, such as authentication, software and hardware vulnerabilities, and defences against cyberattacks. However, only a limited number of cybersecurity experts have a comprehensive understanding of all aspects of this sector. Hence, it is vital to possess an impartial comprehension of the prevailing patterns in cyberse-curity research. Scientometric analysis and knowledge mapping may effectively detect cybersecurity research trends, significant studies, and emerging technologies within this particular context. The main aim of this research is to comprehend the developmental trend of the academic literature about the concepts of "malware detection" and 'cybersecurity'. We collected 9,967 publications from January 2019 to December 2023 and used the Citespace tool for scientometric analysis. This study found six co-citation clusters,namely malware classification, evading malware classifier, android malware detection, IoT network, CNN, and ransomeware families. Additionally, this study discovered that the top contributing countries are the USA, China, and India based on the citation count, and the Chinese Academy of Science, the University of California, and the University of Texas are the top contributing institutions based on the frequency of the publications.

AB  - Abstract The state of research in the Science of Team Science is characterised by a wide range of findings on how successful research collaboration should be structured. However, it remains unclear how the multitude of findings can be put into a hierarchical order with regard to their significance for the success of cooperation. This is where the article comes in: based on the state of research, the question of which intra- and interpersonal factors are most significant for the success of a research team is investigated. In order to explore the ten most important reasons for the success of a research collaboration, a Random Forest classifier is specified that predicts the success of research collaborations on the basis of 51 input variables. The analyses presented in the paper are based on representative survey data on n = 1.417 principal investigators and spokespersons of ongoing and completed research clusters funded by the German Research Foundation. The success of a research cluster is operationalised as the extent to which it has achieved the goals that it communicated to the funding agency before it began. Highly realistic and clear research objectives are central to the success of research clusters, as are comprehensive agreement on objectives, close interconnection of the subprojects’ research work and a fair and trusting cooperation climate.

AB  - In the era of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), a significant challenge hindering digital transformation is the lack of mutual understanding between academia—particularly within engineering and computer science—and the industrial sector, especially small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This gap can result in industries missing out on the potential benefits of cutting-edge scientific research and innovations that can address their daily concerns. At the same time, academics may struggle to identify real-world application areas for their emerging technological solutions. Moreover, the ever-increasing complexity of industrial challenges and technologies has widened the hiatus. To address this issue, our study introduces a comprehensive taxonomy, developed through a transparent, iterative process and presented via a user-centric web platform. Distinct from existing taxonomies, ours emphasizes practical applicability by categorizing and connecting industrial challenges with I4.0 technologies using articles, best practices, and use cases from academic and grey literature, thereby effectively bridging the academic-industrial communication gap. Its effectiveness and practical utility were validated in a workshop as part of the Erasmus+ project PLANET4, where industry professionals provided positive feedback after applying it to real-world challenges. Future work will include expanding the taxonomy, developing an Industry 4.0 ontology, and further enhancing the usability and maintainability of the developed web platform.

AB  - Reliability assessment refers to the process of evaluating reliability of components or systems during their lifespan or prior to their implementation. In the manufacturing industry, the reliability of systems is directly linked to production efficiency, product quality, energy consumption, and other crucial performance indicators. Therefore, reliability plays a critical role in every aspect of manufacturing. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the most significant advancements and trends in the assessment of manufacturing system reliability. For this, we also consider the three main facets of reliability analysis of cyber–physical systems, i.e., hardware, software, and human-related reliability. Beyond the overview of literature, we derive challenges and opportunities for reliability assessment of manufacturing systems based on the reviewed literature. Identified challenges encompass aspects like failure data availability and quality, fast-paced technological advancements, and the increasing complexity of manufacturing systems. In turn, the opportunities include the potential for integrating various assessment methods, and leveraging data to automate the assessment process and to increase accuracy of derived reliability models.

AB  - This perspective provides the collective opinions of a dozen chemical reaction engineers from academia and industry. In this sequel to the "Vision 2020: Reaction Engineering Roadmap," published in 2001, we provide our opinions about the field of reaction engineering by addressing the current situation, identifying barriers to progress, and recommending research directions in the context of four industry sectors (basic chemicals, specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and polymers) and five technology areas (reactor system selection, design and scale-up, chemical mechanism development and property estimation, catalysis, nonstandard reactor types, and electrochemical systems). Our collective input in this report includes numerous recommendations regarding research needs in the field of reaction engineering in the coming decades, including guidance for prioritizing efforts in workforce development, measurement science, and computational methods. We see important roles for reaction engineers in the plastics circularity challenge, decarbonization of processes, electrification of chemical reactors, conversion of batch processes to continuous processes, and development of intensified, dynamic reaction processes.

AB  - Abstract In the last decades, research in science mapping has delivered several powerful techniques, based on citation or textual analysis, for charting the intellectual organization of research fields. To map the social network underlying science and scholarship, by contrast, science mapping has mainly relied on one method, co-authorship analysis. This method, however, suffers from well-known limitations related to the practice of authorship. Moreover, it does not perform well on those fields where multi-authored publications are rare. In this study, a new method for mapping the social structure of research fields is advanced, based on the analysis of the acknowledgments of academic publications. We first discuss the standard account of the function of acknowledgments in scholarly communication, then we introduce a new interpretative framework in which the acknowledgments are intended as positioning signals exchanged by researchers. Next, we provide the formal definition of the four acknowledgments-based networks that stand at the core of the method, and we test it on a humanities field, analytic philosophy. Results show that acknowledgement-based networks allow to reconstruct the fine-grained social structure of analytic philosophy from different perspectives. Furthermore, by comparing the citation-based maps of the field with the acknowledgments-based networks, it permits to shed light on the relationship between the intellectual and social layer of analytic philosophy. We conclude by presenting practical limitations of the method and by sketching some further research lines.

AB  - Abstract Using numeric and textual data extracted from over 50,000 finance articles in Social Science Research Network (SSRN) during 2001–19, we examine the relationship between measured qualities and a paper’s readership, eventual outlet, and impact. Conventionality (semantic similarity with existent research) helps boost readership and publication prospects. However, novelty in the forms of emerging topics and databases are associated with better publishing outcomes. Studies that do not easily map into established finance subfields or that introduce nonfinance elements face a higher hurdle. Finally, papers whose research questions span multiple fields are a hard sell, but those building on prior knowledge from multiple fields are valued.

AB  - Abstract The Egyptian economy relies heavily on the agricultural sector. As the population grows, arable land will diminish in the next decades. This makes food supply a priority. Big data could help the agriculture sector to address food security, especially in Egypt. In this paper, we examined the role of big data in agriculture in response to three questions: (1) What are the trend in peer-reviewed papers in the field of business development modeling and management? (2) What approaches were widely used especially in underdeveloped countries? (3) What is the current gap in terms of data sources, modeling, and analytic methods? As a result, 242 peer-reviewed articles have been studied. The contribution and findings of this study are summarized as. (1) A briefing on popular approaches which used frameworks was provided. (2) Publications based on the Internet of Things (IoT) in agriculture have increased dramatically by about 27%, 40%, and 44% in the years 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. (3) Around 37% of publications used Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite images to build popular vegetation indices and land cover maps. (4) The challenges were identified as well as substantial opportunities that might serve as a roadmap for future growth. Therefore, by performing a comparative study in big data from this perspective, we explored the design principles using artificial intelligence and discussed a converged architecture to address the above-mentioned challenges.

AB  - Cancer prevention is one of the most pressing challenges that public health needs to face. In this regard, data-driven research is central to assist medical solutions targeting cancer. To fully harness the power of data-driven research, it is imperative to have well-organized machine-readable facts into a knowledge base (KB). Motivated by this urgent need, we introduce the Collaborative Oriented Relation Extraction (CORE) system for building KBs with limited manual annotations. CORE is based on the combination of distant supervision and active learning paradigms and offers a seamless, transparent, modular architecture equipped for large-scale processing. We focus on precision medicine and build the largest KB on 'fine-grained' gene expression-cancer associations-a key to complement and validate experimental data for cancer research. We show the robustness of CORE and discuss the usefulness of the provided KB. Database URL https://zenodo.org/record/7577127.

AB  - The adoption of Sign Language Communication (SLC) systems has become more significant in closing the interaction between the deaf society and the world of hearing people. In this study, researchers aim to contribute to this field by developing a system that helps sign language users communicate through BERT approaches based on deep learning frameworks as well as NLP. Accurate recognition of sign language is critical for SLC systems to work well. Deep learning models are effective in identifying sign language with high accuracy. This study aims to determine the most suitable DL model for identifying sign language and assess the impact of incorporating Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in generating frequent and accurate responses in SLC systems. The NLP model will be developed as an optimum return mechanism to generate frequent responses. This research includes testing three different deep learning models: MLP, CNN, and RestNet50v2 to recognize sign language gestures. Restnet50v2 outscored the other two approaches with a 0.97% perfection. As said earlier, the system also generates automated responses using the NLP BERT model, with an overall accuracy of 0.8% and a BLEU score of 0.83%. This method has a way to enhance interaction among the deaf community via the use of technology, opening new avenues for developing intelligent chatbots that can better understand nonverbal communication. Further research can be done to expand its functionality to recognize a broader range of sign language gestures and improve the user interface. Overall, this study demonstrates how technology can enhance the ways of people with deafness or hearing loss by addressing communication barriers.

AB  - With increasing pressure to revitalize manufacturing industries with Smart Manufacturing capability within the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) context, companies have uneven readiness reflecting their gaps and barriers for transforming to the I4.0 state. Understanding factors and measuring a company’s maturity in addressing the I4.0 transformation is crucial to diagnose the company’s current condition and provide corresponding prescriptive action plan effectively. Despite the positive trend of maturity models for the industries, companies still face challenges with low I4.0 adoption rate. Designing a corresponding diagnostic framework into an intelligent maturity model will ultimately lead the company’s pathways toward the desired capabilities. In response, we systematically review and select the state-of-the-art research through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) conduct to scrutinize the main characteristics of 14.0 Maturity Models. Subsequently, 35 exceptional articles published between 1980-2020 were selected for in-depth analysis of their structure, dimensions, and analytical features. Our analysis revealed the descriptive method have been widely used in many maturity models while few more-advanced prescriptive models design adopt fuzzy rule-base analytical hierarchy, knowledge based, Monte-Carlo methods, and even expert-system approaches. Furthermore, people, culture, organization, resources, information system, business processes, and smart technology, products and services have been treated as the popular evaluation dimensions which will define the state of an industry’s maturity level.

AB  - Background There were 2 major incentives introduced by the Chinese government to promote medical informatics in 2009 and 2016. As new drugs are the major source of medical innovation, informatics-related concepts and techniques are a major source of digital medical innovation. However, it is unclear whether the research efforts of medical informatics in China have met the health needs, such as disease management and population health. Objective We proposed an approach to mapping the interplay between different knowledge entities by using the tree structure of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) to gain insights into the interactions between informatics supply, health demand, and technological applications in digital medical innovation in China. Methods All terms under the MeSH tree parent node “Diseases [C]” or node “Health [N01.400]” or “Public Health [N06.850]” were labelled as H. All terms under the node “Information Science [L]” were labelled as I, and all terms under node “Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]” were labelled as T. The H-I-T interactions can be measured by using their co-occurrences in a given publication. Results The H-I-T interactions in China are showing significant growth and a more concentrated interplay were observed. Computing methodologies, informatics, and communications media (such as social media and the internet) constitute the majority of I-related concepts and techniques used for resolving the health promotion and diseases management problems in China. Generally there is a positive correlation between the burden and informatics research efforts for diseases in China. We think it is not contradictory that informatics research should be focused on the greatest burden of diseases or where it can have the most impact. Artificial intelligence is a competing field of medical informatics research in China, with a notable focus on diagnostic deep learning algorithms for medical imaging. Conclusions It is suggested that technological transfers, namely the functionality to be realized by medical/health informatics (eg, diagnosis, therapeutics, surgical procedures, laboratory testing techniques, and equipment and supplies) should be strengthened. Research on natural language processing and electronic health records should also be strengthened to improve the real-world applications of health information technologies and big data in the future.

AB  - Supply chain management (SCM) encompasses a wide variety of decision-making problems that affect business and supply chain performance. Since most of these problems involve uncertainty and hesitation on the part of decision makers (DMs), various studies have emerged recently that present SCM applications of techniques based on Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets (HFLTSs) and HFLTS extensions. Given the relevance of this subject and the lack of literature review studies, this study presents a systematic review of HFLTS and HFLTS extension applications to SCM decision-making problems. In order to answer a set of research questions, the selected papers were classified in accordance with a group of factors that are pertinent to the origins of these studies, SCM, HFLTSs, and decision making. The results demonstrated that the Source and Enable processes have been studied with greater frequency, while the most common problems have to do with supplier selection, failure evaluation, and performance evaluation. The companies of the automotive sector predominated in the analyzed studies. Even though most of the studies used techniques based on HFLTSs, we identified applications of seven distinct HFLTS extensions. The main contribution of this study consists of presenting an overview of the use of HFLTSs and their extensions in practical examples of SCM, highlighting trends and research opportunities. It is the first study to analyze applications of decision-making techniques that deal with hesitation in SCM. Therefore, the results can help researchers and practitioners develop new studies that involve the use of HFLTSs and HFLTS extensions in decision-making problems, given that this study systematizes elements that should be considered in the modeling, application, and validation of these methods.

AB  - Nitrogen (N), an indispensable mineral nutrient element for plant growth and development, is a major limiting source of productivity in many terrestrial ecosystems. Soil organic nitrogen (SON) is a crucial form of nitrogen (N) in the N cycle within terrestrial ecosystems, acting as either a “source” or a “sink” for environmental N release. In order to illustrate the research trends, evolution process and hotspots of SON, a bibliometric analysis was used to analyze 906 documents based on the ISI (Institute of Scientific Information) Web of Science (WoS) database. The results indicated that (1) the number of published papers on SON research showed a wavy growth from 2000 to 2022 and the research has entered a mature development period; China has been increasing its number of publications and has long been in the lead; (2) the most productive institutions and authors in this subject area are in the USA and China, with the Chinese Academy of Sciences being the key institution performing such research; (3) in the sample, Soil Biology and Biochemistry, Science of the Total Environment, and Biogeochemistry are the leading international journals that have played a key role in the evolution of the field and have laid a solid foundation for future research; (4) the characteristics and maintenance of SON in farmland and SON migration in small watersheds under forest conversion have become research hotspots. Through the in-depth analysis of SON research, this paper provides a better understanding of the development trends of SON over the past 20 years, which can also provide reference for future research.

AB  - Name ambiguity is common in academic digital libraries, such as multiple authors having the same name. This creates challenges for academic data management and analysis, thus name disambiguation becomes necessary. The procedure of name disambiguation is to divide publications with the same name into different groups, each group belonging to a unique author. A large amount of attribute information in publications makes traditional methods fall into the quagmire of feature selection. These methods always select attributes artificially and equally, which usually causes a negative impact on accuracy. The proposed method is mainly based on representation learning for heterogeneous networks and clustering and exploits the self-attention technology to solve the problem. The presentation of publications is a synthesis of structural and semantic representations. The structural representation is obtained by meta-path-based sampling and a skip-gram-based embedding method, and meta-path level attention is introduced to automatically learn the weight of each feature. The semantic representation is generated using NLP tools. Our proposal performs better in terms of name disambiguation accuracy compared with baselines and the ablation experiments demonstrate the improvement by feature selection and the meta-path level attention in our method. The experimental results show the superiority of our new method for capturing the most attributes from publications and reducing the impact of redundant information.

AB  - Maps of science visualizing the structure of science help us analyze the current spread of science, technology, and innovation (ST&I). ST&I enterprises can use the maps of science as competitive technical intelligence to anticipate changes, especially those initiated in their immediate vicinity. Research laboratories and universities can understand their environmental changes and use the map for their research management. However, traditional maps based on bibliometrics, such as citation and cocitation, have difficulty in representing recently published papers and ongoing projects that have few or no references; thus, maps based on contents, i.e., text-mining, have been developed in recent years for locating research papers/projects, for example, using word and paragraph vectors. The content-based maps, however, still pose difficulty in comparing documents in different languages. Therefore, aiming to construct a bilingual (English and Japanese) content-based map of science for the analyses of ST&I information resources in different languages, this article proposes a method for creating word and paragraph vectors corresponding to bilingual textual information in the same multidimensional space. In a comparison of 11 methods for generating document vectors, we confirmed that the best method achieved 87% accuracy of the bilingual content matching based on 10$\,$000 IEEE papers. Finally, we published a map of approximately 150$\,$000 funding projects of the National Science Foundation, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, and Japan Science and Technology agency from 2013 to 2017.

AB  - The ability to accurately identify tomato leaves in a field setting is crucial for achieving early yield estimation, particularly with the growing importance of Precision Agriculture.It may be difficult to determine exactly what diseases are affecting tomato plants due to the overlap in symptoms between different diseases.These are the earliest signs of disease that we found in the leaves of tomato plants.Yellow leaf curl virus, leaf mold, light blight, early blight, Mosaic virus, Septoria leaf spot, and bacterial spot are just some of the seven types of plant leaf diseases that were taken into account in this paper.For the development of a testbed environment for data acquisition, the greenhouse at the university was utilized for data on the leaves of tomato plants.This study proposes a target detection model based on the improved YOLOv7 to accurately detect and categorize tomato leaves in the field.To improve the model's feature extraction capabilities, we first incorporate the detection mechanisms SimAM and DAiAM into the framework of the baseline YOLOv7 network.To reduce the amount of information lost during the down sampling process, the max-pooling convolution (MPConv) structure is then improved.After that, this model arrived at a satisfactory outcome.Then, the image is segmented using the SIFT technique for classification, and the key regions are extracted for use in calculating feature values.After that, these data points are sent to a CNN classifier, which has a 98.8% accuracy rate and a 1.2% error rate.Finally, we compare our study to previous research to show how useful the proposed work is and to provide backing for the concept.

AB  - Engineering economics is a cross subject with a wide range of applications, and it has taken on different characteristics with the changing times. The aim of this paper is to depict a sufficiently elaborate and vivid knowledge map of this field, with further discussion and outlook on the hotspots presented therein. Based on the principles and methods of bibliometrics, we use several visualization tools, mainly Vosviewer, to present the characteristics of the published literature within the field of engineering economics from multiple perspectives. Specifically, we collect 624 engineering economics documents published in the Web of Science core collection database between 1915 and 2021, and quantitatively analyze them in the following three aspects: (1) basic data characteristics, including annual publications, annual citations, research directions, and highly cited publications; (2) outstanding performers and cooperations in the four levels of country/region, institution, source and author, including co-authorship, bibliographic coupling, co-citation and co-occurrence analyses; and (3) keyword analyses, including co-occurrence analyses, burst detection analyses, and high-frequency word clouds. In addition, we further explore important topics within the field represented by intelligent and green transformation.

AB  - Abstract Discovering authoritative links between publications and the datasets that they use can be a labor‐intensive process. We introduce a natural language processing pipeline that retrieves and reviews publications for informal references to research datasets, which complements the work of data librarians. We first describe the components of the pipeline and then apply it to expand an authoritative bibliography linking thousands of social science studies to the data‐related publications in which they are used. The pipeline increases recall for literature to review for inclusion in data‐related collections of publications and makes it possible to detect informal data references at scale. We contribute (1) a novel Named Entity Recognition (NER) model that reliably detects informal data references and (2) a dataset connecting items from social science literature with datasets they reference. Together, these contributions enable future work on data reference, data citation networks, and data reuse.

AB  - Abstract This study aims to explore technological advances and prospects in phenol treatment by providing a detailed bibliometric survey of wastewater treatment applications, highlighting innovative advances in research. Using the Web of Science database, we identified 79,104 articles from 2003 to 2023, later refined to 1848. The keywords were used for the initial search: “phenol”, “wastewater”, “degradation”, “treatment” and “removal”. The bibliographic review details the occurrence of journals, authors, newspapers, countries, institutions, keywords, highly cited articles, and prominent predominant research fields. In particular, the field of “Engineering” was responsible for 32% of the published articles, followed by “Ecology of Environmental Sciences” (25%) and “Chemistry” (12%). In addition, a keyword analysis revealed five major groups of clusters that indicate where the research is progressing. This aspect is crucial for understanding the evolution and perspectives of research interests over time. Therefore, future research in the field should prioritize wastewater treatment and feedstock diversification. This focus is essential to address significant challenges, such as production costs, stability, and durability of treatment processes. Graphical Abstract

AB  - This paper uses newly available data from Web of Science on publications matched to researchers in Survey of Doctorate Recipients to compare the quality of scientific publication data collected by surveys versus algorithmic approaches. We illustrate the different types of measurement errors in self-reported and machine-generated data by estimating how publication measures from the two approaches are related to career outcomes (e.g., salaries and faculty rankings). We find that the potential biases in the self-reports are smaller relative to the algorithmic data. Moreover, the errors in the two approaches are quite intuitive: the measurement errors in algorithmic data are mainly due to the accuracy of matching, which primarily depends on the frequency of names and the data that was available to make matches, while the noise in self reports increases over the career as researchers’ publication records become more complex, harder to recall, and less immediately relevant for career progress. At a methodological level, we show how the approaches can be evaluated using accepted statistical methods without gold standard data. We also provide guidance on how to use the new linked data.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly developing field of research that attracts significant funding from both the state and industry players. Such interest is driven by a wide range of AI technology applications in many fields. Since many AI research topics relate to computer science, where a significant share of research results are published in conference proceedings, the same applies to AI. The world leaders in artificial intelligence research are China and the United States. The authors conducted a comparative analysis of the bibliometric indicators of AI conference papers from these two countries based on Scopus data. The analysis aimed to identify conferences that receive above-average citation rates and suggest publication strategies for authors from these countries to participate in conferences that are likely to provide better dissemination of their research results. The results showed that, although Chinese researchers publish more AI papers than those from the United States, US conference papers are cited more frequently. The authors also conducted a correlation analysis of the MNCS index, which revealed no high correlation between MNCS USA vs. MNCS China, MNCS China/MNCS USA vs. MSAR, and MNCS China/MNCS USA vs. CORE ranking indicators.

AB  - Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs), as the most recognized data schema for Building Information Modeling (BIM), are increasingly combined with ontology to facilitate data interoperability across the whole lifecycle in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Facility Management (AEC/FM). This paper conducts a bibliometric analysis of 122 papers from the perspective of data, model, and application to summarize the modes of IFC and ontology integration (IFCOI). This paper first analyzes the data and models of the integration from IFC data formats and ontology development models to the IfcOWL data model. Next, the application status is summed up from objective and phase dimensions, and four frequent applications with maturity are identified. Based on the aforementioned multi-dimensional analysis, three integration modes are summarized, taking into account various data interoperability requirements. Accordingly, ontology behaves as the representation of domain knowledge, an enrichment tool for IFC model semantics, and a linkage between IFC data and other heterogeneous data. Finally, this paper points out the challenges and opportunities for IFCOI in the data, domain ontology, and integration process and proposes a building lifecycle management model based on IFCOI.

AB  - Having emerged as strategic focal points in industrial transformation and technological innovation, intelligent machine tools are pivotal in the field of intelligent manufacturing. Accurately forecasting emerging technologies within this domain is crucial for guiding intelligent manufacturing’s evolution and fostering rapid innovation. However, prevailing research methodologies exhibit limitations, often concentrating on popular topics at the expense of lesser-known yet significant areas, thereby impacting the accurate identification of research priorities. The complex, systemic, and interdisciplinary nature of intelligent machine tool technology challenges traditional research approaches, particularly in assessing technological maturity and intricate interactions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework that leverages technological communities for a comprehensive analysis. This approach clusters data into specific topics which are reflective of the technology system, facilitating detailed investigations within each area. By refining community analysis methods and integrating structural and interactive community features, our framework significantly improves the precision of emerging technology predictions. Our research not only validates the framework but also projects key emerging technologies in intelligent machine tools, offering valuable insights for business leaders and scholars alike.

AB  - As we enter an age where the behavior and capabilities of artificial intelligence and autonomous system technologies become ever more sophisticated, cooperation, collaboration, and teaming between people and these machines is rising to the forefront of critical research areas. People engage socially with almost everything with which they interact. However, unlike animals, machines do not share the experiential aspects of sociality. Experiential robotics identifies the need to develop machines that not only learn from their own experience, but can learn from the experience of people in interactions, wherein these experiences are primarily social. In this paper, we argue, therefore, for the need to place experiential considerations in interaction, cooperation, and teaming as the basis of the design and engineering of person-machine teams. We first explore the importance of semantics in driving engineering approaches to robot development. Then, we examine differences in the usage of relevant terms like trust and ethics between engineering and social science approaches to lay out implications for the development of autonomous, experiential systems.

AB  - Currently, sport is considered an entertainment and leisure industry and includes activities such as athletics, water, and skiing. The influence of a sport event exceeds the event itself, which indicates the importance of a sport facility to the building and construction. A sport facility refers to a facility related to the sport industry, mainly including not only stadiums, swimming pools, and sport centers, but also water parks, ski resorts, and other amusement facilities. At present, there is a lack of comprehensive exploration of integrated building information modeling (BIM) with sport and facilities and performance of applications to help identify potential opportunities to support sustainable development. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the integration of BIM, sport, and facility by revealing the current research status and hotspots in the field, which identifies the development lineage and emerging areas of the research and highlights the development trends and directions for future research towards sustainable development. This paper adopts a quantitative research method to investigate the current research status, hotspots, emerging areas, development trends, and important directions in the integration of BIM, sport, and facilities from macro-quantitative perspectives via bibliometric tools, i.e., VOSviewer and CiteSpace software packages. The main findings of this paper are that the hot keywords on the integration of BIM, sport, and facilities are mainly focused on BIM, facility management, framework, management, sport, construction, and design. Moreover, over the past 26 years (year 1997 to 2022), hot keywords for each year have been revealed through keyword co-occurrence overlay visualization analysis and identified in five schemes, i.e., life cycle assessment, emerging technology, behavior and sport, health and wellbeing, and sustainable built environment. Furthermore, the application of deep learning, IoT, and immersive experience technologies are current hot topics which could provide more innovative breakthroughs for the integration of BIM, sport, and facilities in the future for sustainable development.

AB  - Abstract Business operations and supporting data analysis initiatives are impeded by the silos of data present within departments, systems, and business units. Consequently, the ability of managers and engineers to harness data for operational management and informed decision-making is curtailed. The rapid advancements in technology have revolutionized various aspects of product development, manufacturing, operations, and end-of-life treatment. One such transformative concept, the digital thread, has emerged as an important paradigm. It orchestrates the integration of information and data along the entire product lifecycle, spanning from initial design and engineering through production, maintenance, use, and eventual end of life. While the digital thread has garnered increasing attention within both the research community and industrial enterprises, there remains a notable lack of standardization concerning its utilization and applications. This comprehensive literature review aims to explore the role of the digital thread in manufacturing within the context of the product lifecycle. As a result, this review synthesizes insights into the technologies, roles, and functions of the digital thread throughout the product lifecycle. Furthermore, it proposes a structured framework designed to impart a standardized perspective of the digital thread’s relevance within the manufacturing product lifecycle. Ultimately, this framework is poised to serve as a guiding resource for practitioners and researchers in designing and implementing digital threads.

AB  - Abstract Many disciplines, including the broad Field of Information (iField), offer Data Science (DS) programs. There have been significant efforts exploring an individual discipline's identity and unique contributions to the broader DS education landscape. To advance DS education in the iField, the iSchool Data Science Curriculum Committee (iDSCC) was formed and charged with building and recommending a DS education framework for iSchools. This paper reports on the research process and findings of a series of studies to address important questions: What is the iField identity in the multidisciplinary DS education landscape? What is the status of DS education in iField schools? What knowledge and skills should be included in the core curriculum for iField DS education? What are the jobs available for DS graduates from the iField? What are the differences between graduate‐level and undergraduate‐level DS education? Answers to these questions will not only distinguish an iField approach to DS education but also define critical components of DS curriculum. The results will inform individual DS programs in the iField to develop curriculum to support undergraduate and graduate DS education in their local context.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to tackle the increasing prevalence of employee burnout by introducing a novel hybrid methodology employing Bayesian networks and fuzzy logic. This approach seeks to identify and address burnout risks comprehensively. Theoretical Framework: Drawing from burnout theories alongside Bayesian networks and fuzzy logic, this research establishes a robust foundation for understanding burnout complexities and evaluating the efficacy of the proposed hybrid approach. Method: The methodology encompasses a model development phase utilizing OpenMarkov and FisPro to integrate Bayesian networks and fuzzy logic. Data collection involved a multifaceted approach including surveys, expert interviews, and a thorough review of literature focusing on workload, work environment, psychology, and other pertinent factors influencing burnout. Results and Discussion: Findings indicate that burnout tends to manifest at lower levels in scenarios characterized by weak communication, high workload, and low obstacles, while it escalates in situations marked by weak communication, occasional workload spikes, and moderate obstacles, among other contributing factors. These results are analyzed within the context of the theoretical framework, emphasizing their implications for individual well-being and organizational success. Research Implications: This study provides actionable insights for companies, particularly human resources managers, to bolster employee psychological support systems and advance organizational objectives. Proactively addressing burnout risks can enhance both employee well-being and overall organizational performance. Originality/Value: By proposing a hybrid methodology that merges Bayesian networks and fuzzy logic to comprehensively tackle burnout risks, this research contributes to the existing literature. The innovative methodology and practical implications underscore the significance and applicability of this study for organizations striving to mitigate burnout within their workforce.

AB  - Abstract Although Business Intelligence (BI) and Business Analytics (BA) have been widely adopted in the tourism sector, comparative research using BI and BA remains scarce. To fill this gap in the literature, the present study explores how BI and BA contribute to strategic innovation, address operational challenges, and enhance customer engagement. To this end, using a dual-method approach that incorporates both quantitative and qualitative methodologies, we first conduct a bibliometric analysis using SciMAT. This sets the stage for the subsequent application of the Gioia methodology. Specifically, we perform an in-depth qualitative examination of a total of 12 scholarly articles on the tourism sector, evenly split between BI and BA. Upon synthesizing the findings on the roles of BI and BA, we outline distinct pathways through which they influence tourism sector management solutions. Based on the obtained evidence, we argue that, while BI focuses on technological advancement and operational integration, BA is more aligned with predictive analytics and data-driven customer engagement. These insights provide managers with a better understanding of the roles of BI and BA, serving as a guide for their strategic applications, from improving service quality to innovating in customer engagement. The novelty of this approach lies in its use of the Gioia methodology, in a comparative analysis to evaluate the separate yet complementarily roles of BI and BA, and in enhancing tourism industry practices.

AB  - The present study offers a thorough scientometric analysis of the practice of bioclimatic retrofitting in commercial buildings, which is considered a crucial approach for mitigating energy consumption and addressing the challenges posed by climate change. Since Scopus offers advanced tools for literature search and analysis, its database was used to acquire bibliographic data for nearly 400 published papers using a bibliometric search, a scientometric methodology, and an in-depth qualitative analysis. The scientometric procedure utilizes various quantitative dimensions, such as the number of intermediate citations, occurrences, average publication year, and general connection power. A retrospective examination of research publication patterns spanning 2008 to May 2022 has unveiled an upward trajectory in scholarly investigations pertaining to commercial buildings during this 15-year period. Nevertheless, research on the topics of bioclimatic design, retrofitting strategies, and green building practices in the context of commercial buildings exhibits a more gradual incline, displaying an almost linear trend between the years 2016 and 2020. Additionally, the study provides qualitative perspectives on the research environment. The paper delineates various focal points of research within the field, encompassing thermal comfort in the context of energy management and climate control, ventilation systems, sustainable development as it pertains to architectural designs and green buildings, retrofitting strategies in commercial buildings to enhance energy efficiency, the interplay between carbon dioxide levels and energy resources, the utilization of solar energy, the relationship between energy conservation and atmospheric temperature, and the application of building energy simulation techniques.

AB  - Classifying scientific publications according to Field-of-Science taxonomies is of crucial importance, powering a wealth of relevant applications including Search Engines, Tools for Scientific Literature, Recommendation Systems, and Science Monitoring. Furthermore, it allows funders, publishers, scholars, companies, and other stakeholders to organize scientific literature more effectively, calculate impact indicators along Science Impact pathways and identify emerging topics that can also facilitate Science, Technology, and Innovation policy-making. As a result, existing classification schemes for scientific publications underpin a large area of research evaluation with several classification schemes currently in use. However, many existing schemes are domain-specific, comprised of few levels of granularity, and require continuous manual work, making it hard to follow the rapidly evolving landscape of science as new research topics emerge. Based on our previous work of scinobo, which incorporates metadata and graph-based publication bibliometric information to assign Field-of-Science fields to scientific publications, we propose a novel hybrid approach by further employing Neural Topic Modeling and Community Detection techniques to dynamically construct a Field-of-Science taxonomy used as the backbone in automatic publication-level Field-of-Science classifiers. Our proposed Field-of-Science taxonomy is based on the OECD fields of research and development (FORD) classification, developed in the framework of the Frascati Manual containing knowledge domains in broad (first level(L1), one-digit) and narrower (second level(L2), two-digit) levels. We create a 3-level hierarchical taxonomy by manually linking Field-of-Science fields of the sciencemetrix Journal classification to the OECD/FORD level-2 fields. To facilitate a more fine-grained analysis, we extend the aforementioned Field-of-Science taxonomy to level-4 and level-5 fields by employing a pipeline of AI techniques. We evaluate the coherence and the coverage of the Field-of-Science fields for the two additional levels based on synthesis scientific publications in two case studies, in the knowledge domains of Energy and Artificial Intelligence. Our results showcase that the proposed automatically generated Field-of-Science taxonomy captures the dynamics of the two research areas encompassing the underlying structure and the emerging scientific developments.

AB  - Introduction: Teaching methodologies promoting active learning result in higher-order knowledge application, a desirable outcome in health disciplines like Physiology. Flipped-classroom (FC) promotes active learning and engagement in the classroom. Although specialized research keeps accumulating, the advantages of FC for improving academic outcome and ultimately patient care remain controversial and open to further analysis. Objective: This study evaluates the benefits of applying FC to the Neurophysiology module of a Human Physiology course. Methods:We compare final grades of students exposed to standard lecturing (five-years) vs. FC (six-years), and study the FC impact on student motivation, study time and rewards. Differing from conventional FC, we performed no pre-class/in-class assessments, relying on the students' internal motivation to experience our FC model. A printed student workbook was designed as pre-class material for each session. Reading times respect the expected daily study time of students in our system. Results and discussion: Concerning academic performance, our long-term study reports a significant increase in average scores for FC groups. Overall, students get better scores in multiple choice tests than in problem-solving questions. A more detailed analysis uncovers that our FC model helps students to obtain better scores, reducing variability in performance due to assessment methods. Based on our open-ended survey questions, most students rate the FC environment and in-class activities positively and perceive a positive effect of FC on teachers' performance. An objective automatic Sentiment analysis of open-ended answers reveals that FC is positively appreciated by students, associating positive perceptions to their understanding of physiological concepts, and negative evaluations to their time management.

AB  - In the last years, smart working has been introduced as an agile and dynamic way of working which provides high levels of performance, productivity, and job satisfaction in a “triple-win” configuration for customers, employees, and organizations. Although the advantages and disadvantages related to these new working practices have been recognized by the literature, how these new work practices, widely adopted during the Covid-19 pandemic, have been generally perceived on a massive scale is still unclear. Based on these considerations, this work aims to carry out a big data analysis in order to frame the collective perception about smart working. A large-scale text analytics study has been conducted on Twitter from January to June 2021. The data-driven approach identified the most frequently used macro-concepts about smart working by Twitter’s users: five perceived in a positive way (smartness, work-life balance, flexible approach, productivity, innovative working environment) and five perceived negatively (tech paralysis, technostress, technology hiccups, demotivation, social isolation). In this sense, the study offers several insights by generating useful implications for researchers and professionals both in the organizational design and psychological and Human Resources Management field.

AB  - To reduce the conceptual ambiguity in interdisciplinary knowledge organization systems (KOSs) and enhance interdisciplinary KOS management, this paper proposes a framework for interdisciplinary semantic drift (ISD) detection based on the normal cloud model (NCM). In this framework, we first analyze the features of interdisciplinary concepts and propose a novel interdisciplinary concept extraction method based on cross-discipline statistical information. Secondly, the high-performance knowledge representation model NCM is adopted to represent each interdisciplinary concept with uncertainty, and then a new ISD degree calculation method is proposed based on the similarity cloud algorithm. Thirdly, to identify the direction of ISD after the degree calculation, we propose an ISD direction identification method according to the theory of knowledge potential energy (KPE). Fourthly, based on the above procedure, we propose an ISD detection algorithm to identify and visualize the ISD process. Finally, we evaluate the proposed framework on the concept of "information entropy" and compare the performance with three baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms[ all the baselines, and the result is comparable to experts' judgments (0.808 on Spearman correlation, p<0.001). The research indicates the meaning of an interdisciplinary concept will drift from the high KPE discipline to the low KPE discipline as long as interdisciplinary knowledge potential differences (KPD) exist between these two related disciplines. We further identify three key factors that affect the degree of ISD: the length of the discipline chain of an interdisciplinary concept transfer, the number of source disciplines that an interdisciplinary concept comes from, and the knowledge distance between the source discipline and the target discipline.

AB  - A disciplinary profile of a country is defined as the versor whose components are the number of papers produced in a given discipline divided by the overall production of the country. Starting from the Essential Science Indicators (ESI) schema of classification of subject areas, we obtained the yearly disciplinary profiles of a worldwide graph, where on each node sits a country, in the two time intervals 1988--1988 and 1992--2017, the fall of the Berlin Wall being the watershed. We analyze the empirical pairwise cross-correlation matrices of the time series of disciplinary profiles. The contrast with random matrix theory proves that, beyond measurement noise, the empirical cross-correlation matrices bring genuine information. Arising from the Shannon theorem as the least-structured model consistent with the measured pairwise correlations, the stationary probability distribution of disciplinary profiles can be described by a Boltzmann distribution related to a generalized ${n}_{d}$-dimensional Heisenberg model. The set of network interactions of the Heisenberg model has been inferred and to it, two clusterization methods, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis have been applied. This allows obtaining a characterization of the worldwide bilateral interactions based on physical modeling. A simple geopolitical analysis reveals the consistency of the results obtained and gives a boost to a deeper historical analysis. In order to obtain the optimal set of pairwise interactions, we used a pseudolikelihood approach. We analytically computed the pseudolikelihood and its gradient. The analytical computations deserve interest in whatever inference Bayesian problem involving an ${n}_{d}$-dimensional Heisenberg model.

AB  - Abstract Purpose Interdisciplinary fields have become the driving force of modern science and a significant source of scientific innovation. However, there is still a paucity of analysis about the essential characteristics of disciplines’ cross-disciplinary impact. Design/methodology/approach In this study, we define cross-disciplinary impact on one discipline as its impact to other disciplines, and refer to a three-dimensional framework of variety-balance-disparity to characterize the structure of cross-disciplinary impact. The variety of cross-disciplinary impact of the discipline was defined as the proportion of the high cross-disciplinary impact publications, and the balance and disparity of cross-disciplinary impact were measured as well. To demonstrate the cross-disciplinary impact of the disciplines in science, we chose Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) as the data source, and investigated the relationship between disciplines’ cross-disciplinary impact and their positions in the Hierarchy of Science (HOS). Findings Analytical results show that there is a significant correlation between the ranking of cross-disciplinary impact and the HOS structure, and that the discipline exerts a greater cross-disciplinary impact on its neighboring disciplines. Several bibliometric features that measure the hardness of a discipline, including the number of references, the number of cited disciplines, the citation distribution, and the Price index have a significant positive effect on the variety of cross-disciplinary impact. The number of references, the number of cited disciplines, and the citation distribution have significant positive and negative effects on balance and disparity, respectively. It is concluded that the less hard the discipline, the greater the cross-disciplinary impact, the higher balance and the lower disparity of cross-disciplinary impact. Research limitations In the empirical analysis of HOS, we only included five broad disciplines. This study also has some biases caused by the data source and applied regression models. Practical implications This study contributes to the formulation of discipline-specific policies and promotes the growth of interdisciplinary research, as well as offering fresh insights for predicting the cross-disciplinary impact of disciplines. Originality/value This study provides a new perspective to properly understand the mechanisms of cross-disciplinary impact and disciplinary integration.

AB  - Male solo travelers tend to be more frequent and mobile compared to female solo travelers. This difference can be attributed to travel constraints and safety issues. Social media connects like-minded people and serves as an inspirational resource for deciding where to go and what to do. Numerous netizen travelers are actively sharing their journeys and experiences on their social media profiles. Exciting dining options, diverse locations, recommendations for restaurants, accommodations, and personal experiences are all shared on social media platforms. Millennials rely on electronic word of mouth (e-WOM) to form perceptions about a destination. Thus, the study aims to gain insights into the experiences of solo female travelers who are active on social media platforms. Sentiment analysis is performed on Twitter data by analyzing the latest and trending tweets, which helps in gaining valuable insights regarding the safety of women travelers. Furthermore, research is being conducted to analyze the positive aspects of the travel experience using the Experience Economy model, which provides opportunities for self-discovery and personal growth.

AB  - With the rapid development of digital technology, the mode of production has been transformed into digitalization, virtualization and technologization. The labor has been changed from the real world to the virtual digital world, and digital labor has become an important part of the labor form in modern society. According to bibliometrics and Mapping Knowledge Domains, this study aims to reveal the research status, hot spots and future development trends in the field of digital labor. Based on this, this study takes the relevant core literature from 1990-2023 includes Web of Science Core Collection and Chinese CNKI as the database, and uses CiteSpace visualization software to conduct comparative analysis. The results of this study show that: the number of publications on digital labor in China is lagging behind that of the international community; the research on digital labor in China started late, and the influence of the literature is weaker than that of the international community; the growth rate of relevant literature in Chinese is faster, and the distribution of disciplines is concentrated, while the literature in English is increasing year by year and is relatively stable, and the distribution of disciplines is wide; there is a partial overlap between Chinese and international digital labor research hotspots, with digital labor being studied under the perspectives of computer science, communication studies, education, and so on; Chinese research still focuses on general theoretical discussions, while international research has been widely conducted in the fields of social media, deep learning, digital labor education, artificial intelligence, computer science and information systems. This study not only provides a theoretical perspective for understanding the interaction between digital technologies and labor, but also offers new perspectives for future research and labor education to address the challenges of digital transformation.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this article is to explore the association of the Relational Capital (RC) embedded in a medical specialist’s social–professional network with the specialist’s economic performance based on social network analysis (SNA). Design/methodology/approach Using health insurance claims data regarding ∼108,000 physicians treating ∼72,000,000 patients, social–professional networks (patient-sharing-networks (PSNs)) of ∼26,000 medical specialists were simulated. To explore the correlation of the network's characteristics (degree centrality, density, relative betweenness centrality and referrer concentration) with economic performance, ordinary-least-squares (OLS)-regression models were estimated for ten common specialties (gynecology, internal medicine, orthopedics, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, dermatology, urology, neurology, radiology and rehabilitative medicine). Findings The study confirms the applicability and strong explanatory power of SNA metrics for RC measurement in ambulatory healthcare. Degree centrality and relative betweenness centrality correlate positively with economic performance, whereas density and referrer concentration exhibit negative coefficients. These results confirm the argument that RC has a strong association with the economic performance of medical specialists. Originality/value The study pioneers SNA for RC measurement in healthcare. It is among the first publications on specialists' PSNs. Questions for future research are proposed.

AB  - Abstract The panorama of data is ever evolving, and big data has emerged to become one of the most hyped terms in the industry. Today, users are the perpetual producers of data that if gleaned and crunched, have the potential to reveal game-changing patterns. This has introduced an important shift regarding the role of data in organizations and many strive to harness to power of this new material. Howbeit, institutionalizing data is not an easy task and requires the absorption of a great deal of complexity. According to the literature, it is estimated that only 13% of organizations succeeded in delivering on their data strategy. Among the root challenges, big data system development and data architecture are prominent. To this end, this study aims to facilitate data architecture and big data system development by applying well-established patterns of microservices architecture to big data systems. This objective is achieved by two systematic literature reviews, and infusion of results through thematic synthesis. The result of this work is a series of theories that explicates how microservices patterns could be useful for big data systems. These theories are then validated through expert opinion gathering with 7 experts from the industry. The findings emerged from this study indicates that big data architectures can benefit from many principles and patterns of microservices architecture.

AB  - Social-ecological systems (SES) research has gained substantial momentum, as witnessed by the growth in SES publications, theories, and frameworks, and the traction these concepts have gained in development and policy arenas. However, the growth and development of the SES field has only been partially examined, which limits our ability to make sense of and support the future development of the field and its ability to inform pressing sustainability challenges. The aim of this study is to understand how SES research has grown and changed over time as a field of study using bibliometric methods, co-authorship and co-citation network analysis. Our study is informed by broader bodies of work that have sought to understand the development of scientific fields, concepts, and research agendas. We highlight key trends that have influenced the organization of the field as well as how key thematic areas of SES research have evolved over time. Our results indicate that the research on SES is (i) mainly carried out by authors located in North America and Europe, (ii) characterized by changes in the terminology employed, as identified through our search terms, (iii) linked to the emergence of major conferences and centers dedicated to SES research, as well as its growth over time, (iv) characterized by a highly interconnected structure, with almost 80% of scholars being connected to each other, and (v) characterized by a shift in citation patterns, with newcomers in the network carving out their niche and replacing the founding figures as the central focus. We discuss the implications of these findings, including the nature of SES research as an "epistemic network," the highly collaborative nature of SES research, and the role played by open-access journals in the growth of SES research in the digital era. We further suggest that the SES research field is at a critical transition point, with contending visions of its future following a more disciplinary path or remaining as a more open interdisciplinary space. We conclude with the questions this raises for future SES research regarding the implications of this duality on the nature, production, and validation of knowledge and its evolution.

AB  - This paper shows that pairwise PageRank orders emerge from two-hop walks. The main tool used here refers to a specially designed sign-mirror function and a parameter curve, whose low-order derivative information implies pairwise PageRank orders with high probability. We study the pairwise correct rate by placing the Google matrix G in a probabilistic framework, where G may be equipped with different random ensembles for model-generated or real-world networks with sparse, small-world, scale-free features, the proof of which is mixed by mathematical and numerical evidence. We believe that the underlying spectral distribution of aforementioned networks is responsible for the high pairwise correct rate. Moreover, the perspective of this paper naturally leads to an O(1) algorithm for any single pairwise PageRank comparison if assuming both A=G−In, where In denotes the identity matrix of order n, and A2 are ready on hand (e.g., constructed offline in an incremental manner), based on which it is easy to extract the top k list in O(kn), thus making it possible for PageRank algorithm to deal with super large-scale datasets in real time.

AB  - Interdisciplinary collaborations have recently attracted the attention of scholars, since they help bridging academic relationships and contribute to make scientific collaboration networks even stronger. However, previous works on this subject have mainly focused on characterizing such interdisciplinary collaborations in specific research groups or scientific communities. In this article, we start from a previous work in which we characterized the interdisciplinary collaborations within the entire Brazilian scientific community, as defined according to the upper level of the knowledge area classification scheme proposed by CNPq, the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, considering the following eight major areas: Agrarian Sciences, Applied and Social Sciences, Biological Sciences, Engineering, Exact and Earth Sciences, Health Sciences, Humanities, and Linguistics, Letters and Arts. Based on this interdisciplinary collaboration network, we conducted a geographic analysis that characterizes how these collaborations have been spread across the Brazilian geographic regions. Overall, our results show strong collaborative ties involving the triad formed by the three main Brazilian geographic regions (Southeast, South and Northeast) for all major areas. Besides, three of the eight major areas (Agrarian Sciences, Biological Sciences, and Health Sciences) show a massive participation in interdisciplinary collaborations across all regions. Despite that, geographic proximity is an important factor, since the proportion of interdisciplinary collaborations involving researchers from the same region is high. Finally, we analyze the patterns of interdisciplinary collaboration by regions and by major areas, thus showing that the Brazilian interdisciplinary network is highly connected.

AB  - In the chemical process, abnormal situations are precursor events of incidents and accidents. Abnormal situation management (ASM) can effectively identify abnormalities and prevent them from evolving into incidents or accidents, ensuring the safe and smooth operation of chemical plants. In recent years, ASM has attracted extensive attention from the process industry and from academia, and a lot of research work has been conducted. However, the intelligence level of ASM in actual chemical plants is still relatively low, and industrial applications still face many difficulties and challenges. This review first summarizes the concepts and involved in the contents of ASM. Then, the latest research progress in various aspects of ASM is systematically reviewed. Finally, the challenges and future research directions of ASM are analyzed based on the perspective of industrial application. This review aims to provide the most cutting-edge reference for follow-up research on ASM, and to promote the intelligent development and practical industrial application of ASM in the chemical process.

AB  - This study analyzed the historical development of resilience with respect to multidisciplinary aspects using association rule mining (ARM). ARM is a rule-based machine-learning approach tailored to identify validated relations among multiple variables in a large dataset. This study collected author keywords from all resilience-related literature in the Web of Science database and examined the changes in validated resilience-related topics using ARM. We found that resilience-related research tends to diversify and expand over time. Although topics and their academic fields related to engineering and complex adaptive systems were prominent in the early 2000s, psychosocialresilience and social-ecologicalresilience have received significant attention in recent years. The increasing interest in resilience-related topics linked to psychological and ecological factors, as well as social system components, can be attributed to the impact of a series of complex and global events that occurred in the late 2000s. Recently, resilience has been conceived as a way of thinking, perspective, or paradigm to address emergent complexity and uncertainty with vague concepts. Resilience is increasingly being regarded as a boundary spanner that promotes communication and collaboration among stakeholders who share different interests and scientific knowledge.

AB  - There is a growing interest in adopting a holistic circular economy (CE) to reach a sustainable and economically viable future, thus there is an increasing need for professionals in the field to do so efficiently. In this regard, good education and knowledge sharing are crucial. This knowledge sharing is bi-directional across generations, with everyone gaining equally from the various viewpoints and experiences. CE strategy research and education are beneficial for the implementation of sustainable development that considers economic, social, and environmental spheres. Additionally, attention is being paid to the younger generation, which is now focused on addressing climate change, as evidenced by the growth of the post-Greta Thunberg phenomena. As a result, this paper proposes a set of recommendations to improve measures for circular economy education (ECE) in order to train future CE experts who can contribute to achieving successful sustainable development. This research proposes, through a literature review and case studies analyses, that enhancing ECE can cultivate future CE specialists who can contribute to the successful pursuit of sustainable development as the demand for green jobs grows. According to our preliminary understanding, widespread ECE can be a critical tool for bringing together experienced circular professionals, students, and younger generations, in meeting their needs and advancing circular development through various forms, including specific training and reskilling of professionals required. However, we discovered a lack of consensus across the case studies on the ideal CE expert or educational modality, which is mirrored in the literature, indicating the need for greater collaboration among different disciplines and stakeholders. There also appears to be a general lack of awareness about the benefits of the CE, necessitating the collaboration between the private and public sectors in providing educational opportunities, accessible study materials, and research funding to accelerate innovation and competitiveness. Thus, institutions and businesses could play a role in standardising basic circular principles and competencies in CE as a means of providing basic guidelines that could be supplemented with specialised courses and diverse content ranging from public knowledge to more specialised professionals or students aiding the implementation of CE strategies, which reduce local disparities increasing green jobs accessibility for youth. Conclusively, this paper looks to provide recommendations for improvements in this field.

AB  - Convergence has been proposed as a revolutionary innovation paradigm that advocates the integration of multidisciplinary knowledge through collaboration to solve complex real-world challenges. From a knowledge perspective, this study examined the evolutionary characteristics and interactions between interdisciplinarity and scientific collaboration in the context of the convergence paradigm using complex networks and bibliometric methods for publications (n = 35,227) in the materials genome engineering (MGE) field in China from 2000 to 2021. The findings are as follows: (1) Under the convergence paradigm, knowledge from five core disciplines forms the skeleton of the multidisciplinary knowledge system in the MGE field. The goal of interdisciplinarity gradually evolves from theoretical exploration to applied research, and the knowledge from various disciplines is increasingly integrated. (2) The development of the scientific collaboration network has gone through three phases: 2000–2009, 2005–2014, and 2015–2021, and its core-periphery structure has been gradually optimized. (3) The evolution of interdisciplinarity is nearly synchronized with the evolution of the scientific collaboration network. (4) The promotion of interdisciplinarity through collaboration is becoming increasingly evident. The proportion of interdisciplinary partnerships increased from 0.66 to 0.87, with the proportion of partnerships involving more than two disciplines increasing from 0.24 to 0.59. (5) Institutions from core and periphery disciplines have diverse partner selection preferences, and disciplinary characteristics related to knowledge similarity and complementarity are important factors influencing scientific collaboration behavior. This study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the convergence paradigm and provides insights for better incubating convergence research projects and advancing top-down innovation management in convergence fields.

AB  - Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMSs) provide a competitive edge in the ever-evolving manufacturing landscape, offering the agility to swiftly adapt to changing customer demands and product lifecycles. Nevertheless, the complex and interconnected nature of FMSs presents a distinct challenge: the evaluation and prioritization of performance variables. This study clarifies a conspicuous research gap by introducing a pioneering approach to evaluating and ranking FMS performance variables. The Best-Worst Method (BWM), a multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach, is employed to tackle this challenge. Notably, the BWM excels at resolving intricate issues with limited pairwise comparisons, making it an innovative tool in this context. To implement the BWM, a comprehensive survey of FMS experts from the German manufacturing industry was conducted. The survey, which contained 34 key performance variables identified through an exhaustive literature review and bibliometric analysis, invited experts to assess the variables by comparing the best and worst in terms of their significance to overall FMS performance. The outcomes of the BWM analysis not only offer insights into the factors affecting FMS performance but, more importantly, convey a nuanced ranking of these factors. The findings reveal a distinct hierarchy: the “Quality (Q)” factor emerges as the most critical, followed by “Productivity (P)” and “Flexibility (F)”. In terms of contributions, this study pioneers a novel and comprehensive approach to evaluating and ranking FMS performance variables. It bridges an evident research gap and contributes to the existing literature by offering practical insights that can guide manufacturing companies in identifying and prioritizing the most crucial performance variables for enhancing their FMS competitiveness. Our research acknowledges the potential introduction of biases through expert opinion, delineating the need for further exploration and comparative analyses in diverse industrial contexts. The outcomes of this study bear the potential for cross-industry applicability, laying the groundwork for future investigations in the domain of performance evaluation in manufacturing systems.

AB  - Architectural construction is responsible for the consumption of large amounts of resources, so the optimization of architectural design and evaluation is significant for sustainable global development. Most architectural assessments focus on energy conservation, novel materials and eco-friendly strategies, but without agreed indicators and criteria. Since the consideration of natural aspects is somewhat fuzzy and vague, this study utilized data mining technology to explore the major factors related to relationships between buildings and nature. By employing the popular technique of web crawling, this study collected 38,320 architectural descriptions from the “Archdaily”, including descriptions of 11 types of buildings, four of which were taken as typical research representatives. The 100 most frequent words were used to create a word cloud. Using Python script, all of the text was refined and processed with the word2vec model, thereby allowing to conduct Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC). The frequency of words related to natural aspects were analyzed within 15 architectural design elements. Different building types in different areas have obvious similarities in terms of design elements, so it is feasible to adopt the same evaluation factors for the building evaluation systems of different regions. This paper mainly focuses on improving the accuracy and validity of assessment by providing basic evaluation indicators that could enhance connections between design and evaluation progress, stimulating the improvement of building environmental performance.

AB  - In the modern era, the imperative of digitalisation to enhance competitiveness spans various sectors, with agriculture being no exception. Agriculture 4.0, strategically positioned to address challenges like climate change, food security, and resource preservation, holds the potential to increase productivity, profitability, and sustainability in agriculture. Despite the global accessibility to digital technologies, their adoption within the agriculture sector, especially among small and medium-sized farms, encounters obstacles. Realising the full potential of Agriculture 4.0 requires understanding the factors influencing technology adoption. To address this, the study conducts a systematic literature review using the PRISMA method, focusing on identifying the primary drivers and barriers associated with the implementation of Agriculture 4.0 technologies. The study is complemented by a network analysis of the identified drivers and barriers. A total of 42 articles from 2011 to 2023, sourced from the Scopus database, are examined. Individual and farm-related factors play a crucial role in driving the adoption of smart farming technologies, along with social trust and influence. Economic constraints and lack of infrastructure, such as internet access, emerge as significant barriers. The identified drivers and barriers can inform the development of strategies to promote the transition to Agriculture 4.0. Farmers stand to benefit from insights into potential advantages, required skills, and challenges, aiding informed decision-making in the adoption of Agriculture 4.0 technologies.

AB  - The early detection of emerging technologies is crucial for organizations to stay ahead of the technological curve and adapt to the changing market landscape.For this matter, several approaches were proposed to detect emerging technologies.However, these methods often suffer from limitations such as subjectivity because of manual curation and lack of scalability and predictability.In this extended abstract, we present a hybrid approach to detect emerging technology terms using the burst detection algorithm and predict their future trends by combining machine learning techniques with burst detection.We test the proposed approach in artificial intelligence (AI)-related patents.The results show that the proposed approach can predict the future prevalence of AI technology terms with an accuracy of 90.5%.It is also demonstrated that deploying a deep neural network classifier can increase the accuracy by 10-15% compared to a conventional tree-based classifier.We hope the proposed framework supports decision-makers in better identifying emerging terms, especially in evolving multidisciplinary fields such as AI.

AB  - The irreplaceable key to the triumph of Question & Answer (Q&A) platforms is their users providing high-quality answers to the challenging questions posted across various topics of interest. From more than a decade, the expert finding problem attracted much attention in information retrieval research. Based on the encountered gaps in the expert identification across several Q&A portals, we inspect the feasibility of identifying data science experts in Reddit. Our method is based on the manual coding results where two data science experts labelled not only expert and non-expert comments, but also out-of-scope comments, which is a novel contribution to the literature, enabling the identification of more groups of comments across web portals. We present a semi-supervised approach which combines 1,113 labelled comments with 100,226 unlabelled comments during training. The proposed model uses the activity behaviour of every user, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), crowdsourced and user feature sets. We conclude that the NLP and user feature sets contribute the most to the better identification of these three classes. It means that this method can generalise well within the domain. Finally, we make a novel contribution by presenting different types of users in Reddit, which opens many future research directions.

AB  - In a globally interconnected economy marked by volatility, this study employs the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model to examine financial contagion’s impact on Romania’s financial stability. It investigates both conventional and unconventional channels through which financial contagion is transmitted, emphasizing its sensitivity to factors such as geopolitical events and investor sentiment. The study also assesses the influence of unemployment, market capitalization, and financial freedom on Romania’s Human Development Index (HDI) from 2000 to 2022. Using HDI, which encompasses health and education alongside economic aspects, the research provides a holistic view of well-being and quality of life. In addition to the ARDL model’s insights, this study expands its scope by conducting a multilinear regression analysis, with GDP as the dependent variable. We have incorporated independent variables such as HDI, transaction volume, and the BET-FI index to comprehensively assess their relationships and potential impact on Romania’s economic growth. This analytical approach unveils intricate connections between key economic and financial indicators, paving the way for a deeper understanding of how these variables interact. Furthermore, to shed light on the financial dynamics within Romania, a supplementary analysis in the Altreva Adaptive Modeler was undertaken, focusing on the BET-FI index. This software-based exploration provides a nuanced perspective on the index’s behavior and its interactions with other economic and social indicators. This additional dimension contributes to our holistic understanding of the effects of financial contagion and the implications for sustainable human development in Romania. By combining traditional econometric methodologies with cutting-edge modeling techniques, this study strives to offer a robust framework for comprehending the multifaceted nature of financial contagion and its implications for both the national economy and well-being. These findings have the potential to guide policymakers and financial institutions in implementing more effective risk management strategies, driving economic development, and ultimately enhancing the overall quality of life in Romania.

AB  - The rise in the service economy has been fueled by breakthroughs in technology, globalization, and evolving consumer patterns. However, this sector faces various challenges, such as issues related to service quality, innovation, efficiency, and sustainability, as well as macro-level challenges such as globalization, geopolitical risks, failures of financial institutions, technological disruptions, climate change, demographic shifts, and regulatory changes. The impacts of these challenges on society and the economy can be both significant and unpredictable, potentially endangering sustainability. Therefore, it is crucial to comprehensively study services and service economies at both holistic and local levels. To this end, the objective of this study is to develop and validate an artificial-intelligence-based methodology to gain a comprehensive understanding of the service sector by identifying key parameters from the academic literature and public opinion. This methodology aims to provide in-depth insights into the creation of smarter, more sustainable services and economies, ultimately contributing to the development of sustainable future societies. A software tool is developed that employs a data-driven approach involving the use of word embeddings, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and word importance. A large dataset comprising 175 K research articles was created from the Scopus database, and after analysis, 29 distinct parameters related to the service sector were identified and grouped into 6 macro-parameters: smart society and infrastructure, digital transformation, service lifecycle management, and others. The analysis of over 112 K tweets collected from Saudi Arabia identified 11 parameters categorized into 2 macro-parameters: private sector services and government services. The software tool was used to generate a knowledge structure, taxonomy, and framework for the service sector, in addition to a detailed literature review based on over 300 research articles. The conclusions highlight the significant theoretical and practical implications of the presented study for autonomous capabilities in systems, which can contribute to the development of sustainable, responsible, and smarter economies and societies.

AB  - This paper introduces a recommendation system aimed at enhancing the sustainable process of risk management within airport operations, with a special focus on Occupational Stress Risks (OSRs). The recommendation system is implemented via a flexible Python code that offers seamless integration into various operational contexts. It leverages Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) to conduct comprehensive risk assessments, subsequently generating prioritized recommendations for predefined risk management measures aimed at preventing and/or reducing the most critical OSRs. The system’s reliability has been validated by iterating the procedure with diverse input data (i.e., matrices of varying sizes) and measures. This confirms the system’s effectiveness across a broad spectrum of engineering scenarios.

AB  - Transformer technologies, like generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) are increasingly utilized for understanding diverse social media content. Despite their popularity, there is a notable absence of a systematic literature review on their application in disaster analytics. This study investigates the utilization of transformer-based technology in analyzing social media data for disaster and emergency crisis events. Leveraging a systematic review methodology, 114 related works were collated from popular databases like Web of Science and Scopus. After deduplication and following the exclusion criteria, 53 scholarly articles were analyzed, revealing insights into the geographical distribution of research efforts, trends in publication output over time, publication venues, primary research domains, and prevalently used technology. The results show a significant increase in publications since 2020, with a predominant focus on computer science, followed by engineering and decision sciences. The results emphasize that within the realm of social-media-based disaster analytics, BERT was utilized in 29 papers, BERT-based methods were employed in 28 papers, and GPT-based approaches were featured in 4 papers, indicating their predominant usage in the field. Additionally, this study presents a novel classification scheme consisting of 10 distinct categories that thoroughly categorize all existing scholarly works on disaster monitoring. However, the study acknowledges limitations related to sycophantic behavior and hallucinations in GPT-based systems and raises ethical considerations and privacy concerns associated with the use of social media data. To address these issues, it proposes strategies for enhancing model robustness, refining data validation techniques, and integrating human oversight mechanisms.

AB  - This study proposes a framework for proactive and intelligent continuous control monitoring (CCM), which can help executives feel more secure in their company's operations while also easing the stress of being flooded with data. The framework was developed by the Continuous Control Monitoring Consortium (CCMC). The development of CCM artifacts, such as the display of operational and internal control violations and the identification of multidimensional abnormalities, is approached from a design science perspective by our team. In order to demonstrate the architecture, we will give a case study of a real-world implementation. This implementation will involve a company that provides accounting services, a client in the healthcare industry, and the research team all working together to improve the dependability of payroll audits. This paper makes a contribution to the CCM literature by proposing that the utilization of machine learning and interactive data visualization can assist relieve the problem of managers having access to an excessive amount of data. Following this, we present evidence that, from both an economic and a behavioral point of view, the control monitoring approach is an improvement over the traditional one. We demonstrate how cutting-edge technology improves risk assessment, the identification of anomalies, and the avoidance of loss both more efficient and accurate. In addition, we provide guidelines for the production and utilization of artifacts, which is another way that we contribute to the field of control monitoring.

AB  - The proliferation and great variety of low-cost air quality (AQ) sensors, combined with their flexibility and energy efficiency, gives an opportunity to integrate them into Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). However, with these sensors, AQ monitoring poses a significant challenge, as the data collection and analysis process is complex and prone to errors. Although these sensors do not meet the performance requirements for reference regulatory-equivalent monitoring, they can provide informative measurements and more if we can adjust and add further processing to their raw measurements. Therefore, the integration of these sensors aims to facilitate real-time monitoring and achieve a higher spatial and temporal sampling density, particularly in urban areas, where there is a strong interest in providing AQ surveillance services since there is an increase in respiratory/allergic issues among the population. Leveraging a network of low-cost sensors, supported by 5G communications in combination with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques (using Convolutional and Deep Neural Networks (CNN and DNN)) to predict 24-h-ahead readings is the goal of this article in order to be able to provide early warnings to the populations of hazards areas. We have evaluated four different neural network architectures: Multi-Linear prediction (with a dense Multi-Linear Neural Network (NN)), Multi-Dense network prediction, Multi-Convolutional network prediction, and Multi-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network prediction. To perform the training of the prediction of the readings, we have prepared a significant dataset that is analyzed and processed for training and testing, achieving an estimation error for most of the predicted parameters of around 7.2% on average, with the best option being the Multi-LSTM network in the forthcoming 24 h. It is worth mentioning that some pollutants achieved lower estimation errors, such as CO2 with 0.1%, PM10 with 2.4% (as well as PM2.5 and PM1.0), and NO2 with 6.7%.

AB  - The adoption of drones and other emerging digital technologies (DTs) has proven essential in revolutionizing humanitarian logistics as standalone solutions. However, the interoperability of humanitarian drones with other DTs has not yet been explored. In this study, we performed a systematic literature review to attempt to fill this gap by evaluating 101 mathematical models collected from Scopus. After conducting a descriptive analysis to identify the trends of publications in terms of year, type, source, and country of origin, a content analysis ensued to investigate the complementarity, interoperability, and level of integration of humanitarian drones with eight DTs. Next, we researched how these DTs can help drones exploit their capabilities to their full potential and facilitate the various drone operations deployed across different disaster scenarios, types, and stages. Last, the solving approaches employed by the models were examined. Overall, we shifted our research focus toward several overlooked aspects in the literature and identified multiple challenges needing to be addressed. Our work resulted in the formulation of a holistic framework aiming to standardize the cooperative utilization of DTs during the execution of humanitarian drone operations, so as to enhance their real-life application and scalability.

However, modern networked dynamical sociotechnical systems have some features that allow for realizing the benefits of self-organization in a wide range of systems in economic and social areas. The review examines the general principles of self-organized systems, as well as the features of the implementation of self-organization in sociotechnical systems. We also delve into the production systems, in which the technical component is decisive, and social networks, in which the social component dominates; we analyze models used for modeling self-organizing networked dynamical systems. It is shown that discrete models prevail at the micro level. Furthermore, the review deals with the features of using continuous models for modeling at the macro level.

AB  - Analysing user passwords used around the world is a very broad topic and involves a variety of factors. Password analysis is usually based on detailed studies by security experts, cyber security researchers and encryption experts. Weak passwords, repeated passwords, simple patterns, short passwords, personal information are critical contents that create vulnerabilities and are ignored by users. Attackers or attack tools working for password interception can easily intercept passwords that contain security measures below a certain level, that is, passwords that are not complex. The purpose of this study is to analyse global password usage, to increase users' awareness about password security and to encourage users to use stronger passwords. Small program snippets and new tools have been coded to achieve this goal. In future studies, it is aimed to improve the current application by automating the control of the distance of the texts from each other as a new password suggestion method and hybridising machine learning methods.

AB  - The descriptive concepts of “semantic” taxonomies are assigned to content items of the publishing domain for supporting a plethora of operations, mostly regarding the organization and discoverability of the content, as well as for recommendation tasks. However, either not all publishers rely on such structures, or in many cases employ their own proprietary taxonomies, thus the content is either difficult to be retrieved by the end users or stored in publisher-specific fragmented “data-silos”, respectively. To address these issues, the modular and scalable “Dominance Metric” methodology is proposed for rating the dominance and importance of concepts in semantic taxonomies. Our proposed metric is applied both on the vast multidisciplinary Microsoft Academic Graph Fields of Study taxonomy and the MeSH controlled vocabulary in order for their enhanced and refined versions to be produced. Moreover, we describe the cleansing process of the resulting taxonomy from Microsoft’s structure by deduplicating concepts and refining the hierarchical relations towards the increase of its representation quality. Our evaluation procedure provided valuable insights by showcasing that high volume, namely the number of publications a concept is assigned to, does not necessarily imply high influence, but the latter is also affected by the structural and topological properties of the individual entities.

AB  - As a versatile energy carrier, hydrogen possesses tremendous potential to reduce greenhouse emissions and promote energy transition. Global interest in producing hydrogen from renewable energy sources and transporting, storing, and utilizing hydrogen is rising rapidly. However, the high costs of producing clean hydrogen and the uncertain application scenarios for hydrogen energy result in its relatively limited utilization worldwide. It is necessary to find new promising technological paths to drive the development of hydrogen energy. As part of technological innovation, emerging technologies have vital features such as prominent impact, novelty, relatively fast growth, etc. Identifying emerging hydrogen-energy-related technologies is important for discovering innovation opportunities during the energy transition. Existing research lacks analysis of the characteristics of emerging technologies. Thus, this paper proposes a method combining the latent Dirichlet allocation topic model and hydrogen-energy expert group decision-making. This is used to identify emerging hydrogen-related technology regarding two features of emerging technologies, novelty and prominent impact. After data processing, topic modeling, and analysis, the patent dataset was divided into twenty topics. Six emerging topics possess novelty and prominent impact among twenty topics. The results show that the current hotspots aim to promote the application of hydrogen energy by improving the performance of production catalysts, overcoming the wide power fluctuations and large-scale instability of renewable energy power generation, and developing advanced hydrogen safety technologies. This method efficiently identifies emerging technologies from patents and studies their development trends. It fills a gap in the research on emerging technologies in hydrogen-related energy. Research achievements could support the selection of technology pathways during the low-carbon energy transition.

AB  - Abstract The integration of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) into geoscience has experienced a pronounced uptick in recent years, a trend propelled by the intricate nature of geosystems and the abundance of data they produce. These computational methods have been harnessed across a spectrum of geoscientific challenges, from climate modeling to seismic analysis, exhibiting notable efficacy in extracting valuable insights from intricate geological datasets for applications such as mineral prediction. A thorough analysis of the literature indicates a marked escalation in AI-centric geoscience research starting in 2018, characterized by a predictive research orientation and a persistent focus on key computational terms. The thematic network and evolution analyses underscore the enduring prominence of “deep learning” and “machine learning” as pivotal themes, alongside progressive developments in “transfer learning” and “big data”. Despite these advancements, other methodologies have garnered comparatively lesser focus. While ML and DL have registered successes in the realm of mineral prediction, their amalgamation with domain-specific knowledge and symbolic reasoning could further amplify their interpretability and operational efficiency. Neuro-Symbolic AI (NSAI) emerges as a cutting-edge approach that synergizes DL’s robust capabilities with the precision of symbolic reasoning, facilitating the creation of models that are both powerful and interpretable. NSAI distinguishes itself by surmounting traditional ML constraints through the incorporation of expert insights and delivering explanatory power behind its predictive prowess, rendering it particularly advantageous for mineral prediction tasks. This literature review delves into the promising potential of NSAI, alongside ML and DL, within the geoscientific domain, spotlighting mineral prediction as a key area of focus. Despite the hurdles associated with infusing domain expertise into symbolic formats and mitigating biases inherent in symbolic reasoning, the application of NSAI in the realm of critical mineral prediction stands to catalyze a paradigm shift in the field. By bolstering prediction accuracy, enhancing decision-making processes, and fostering sustainable resource exploitation, NSAI holds the potential to significantly reshape geoscience’s future trajectory.

AB  - Abstract Soft set theory, initially introduced through the seminal article “Soft set theory—First results” in 1999, has gained considerable attention in the field of mathematical modeling and decision-making. Despite its growing prominence, a comprehensive survey of soft set theory, encompassing its foundational concepts, developments, and applications, is notably absent in the existing literature. We aim to bridge this gap. This survey delves into the basic elements of the theory, including the notion of a soft set, the operations on soft sets, and their semantic interpretations. It describes various generalizations and modifications of soft set theory, such as N -soft sets, fuzzy soft sets, and bipolar soft sets, highlighting their specific characteristics. Furthermore, this work outlines the fundamentals of various extensions of mathematical structures from the perspective of soft set theory. Particularly, we present basic results of soft topology and other algebraic structures such as soft algebras and $$\sigma$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mi>σ</mml:mi> </mml:math> -algebras. This article examines a selection of notable applications of soft set theory in different fields, including medicine and economics, underscoring its versatile nature. The survey concludes with a discussion on the challenges and future directions in soft set theory, emphasizing the need for further research to enhance its theoretical foundations and broaden its practical applications. Overall, this survey of soft set theory serves as a valuable resource for practitioners, researchers, and students interested in understanding and utilizing this flexible mathematical framework for tackling uncertainty in decision-making processes.

However, it is crucial to understand the focus of Nigerian AI researchers and identify unexplored areas of research that could lead to unprecedented development. To address this need, we used natural language processing, machine learning, and statistical algorithms to investigate the main areas of interest of Nigerian AI researchers. We identified ten topics and used scientometric analyses to reveal key concepts, keyword co-occurrences, and authorship networks. Our study found that Covenant University was the most prolific institution, with 375 publications, followed by the Federal University of Technology with 135 publications and the University of Ibadan with 121 publications. Overall, our research provides valuable insights into the structure and progression of AI research in Nigeria and highlights areas for improvement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

AB  - Considering the emergence and adoption of various innovative technologies, the construction industry has undergone transformation into a more secure, highly efficient, and ecologically sustainable landscape. An increasing number of studies uses the structural equation modeling (SEM) method to explore the dynamics of technology adoption and use within the construction sector. Previous studies have mainly focused on qualitative analysis using the SEM method to analyze technology adoption and usage in the construction industry. This study, however, distinguishes itself from previous research by focusing on the SEM method itself and conducting a systematic analysis using scientometric methods. Based on a total of 140 relevant journal articles, this study adopts a scientometric analysis approach to conduct a holistic review encompassing sources, researchers, keywords, and highly cited documents. The research findings are as follows: (1) the primary focus of the current research topics is on BIM technology; (2) most studies employ cross-sectional SEM instead of longitudinal SEM; (3) there is a deficiency in the theoretical foundation for designing SEM in current research; and (4) the selection of either reflective or formative measures lacks sufficient rigor. Qualitative analysis is used to examine prevailing issues in research design and address the intricate technicalities and potential challenges inherent in the SEM method. Three research gaps and future directions are presented: diversifying regions of study and research topics, incorporating theoretical support for research design, and carefully choosing reflective or formative measures. The findings provide a comprehensive roadmap and valuable reference for future research in this field.

AB  - The use of vegetation and infiltration into soils to manage stormwater and water quality—called green stormwater infrastructure (GSI)—is now widely recognized as a viable alternative or supplement to the pipes and pumps of conventional, or “gray”, drainage infrastructure. Over the years, much research has emerged regarding spatial aspects of GSI implemented at large scales, including where it is located, where it should be located, and what metrics best represent the benefits it brings to different locations. Research in these areas involves expertise from multiple academic disciplines, but it is unclear whether and how researchers from different disciplines identify and approach questions related to the spatiality of GSI. By adopting the explanatory sequential mixed method design, we identified four categories of spatial GSI studies through a literature review of over 120 research papers: empirical, ecological, decision support systems, and optimization. Here, we present representative examples of these categories of spatial GSI studies, as well as associations between the academic disciplines represented in these categories of spatial GSI papers. Then, we conducted semi-structured interviews with a sample of GSI researchers which revealed the value of interdisciplinary training and knowledge. Finally, in this paper, we identify several gaps that could be addressed to improve interdisciplinary research on GSI implementation, and sustainability transitions in general.

An Arduino Uno, a temperature humidity sensor, soil moisture sensor, water level sensor, water pumps, and DC motors strength this system. If the smart farming tracking system turns on, the sensors find the field’s water level and the soil’s moisture level. If the irrigation water stage falls below the level defined for a specific crop grown in the growing area, the irrigation system is going to start to pump water. The IOT warns concerning current level of water, soil moisture stage, and motor beginning will be shown on the LCD panel of the section. We are able to use the pumps by hand via a webpage. The farmers are additionally getting this data via mobile phone. By hitting a system- provided link, the individual using it may firmly prevent the water’s flow within the field.

AB  - In complex systems constrained by multiple factors, it is very important to identify the key influencing factors for mastering the evolution and development law of a system and for obtaining scientific decision-making suggestions or schemes. At present, the method based on experimental simulation is limited by the difficulty of system model construction; DEMATEL (Factual Decision Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) is inevitably influenced by subjective factors. In view of this, we propose a novel model based on heuristic causal inference. By combining the network analysis in complex network science, the model defines the global/local causal pathway and the causal pathway’s length in the causal network and takes the causal pathway contribution degree as an indicator to measure the approximate causal effects. The model includes steps such as causal network learning, causal pathway contribution degree calculation, and key influencing factor identification. The model uses the Fast Causal Inference (FCI) algorithm with prior knowledge to learn the global causal network of the complex system and uses the heuristic causal inference to calculate the causal pathway contribution degree. The heuristic method draws on the idea of complex network topology analysis and measures the influence degree between variables by the number and distance of causal pathways. The key influencing factors are finally identified according to the causal pathway contribution degree. Based on the SECOM dataset, we carried out simulation experiments and demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - This study endeavors to utilize CiteSpace software to construct and examine co-citation networks of references within the domains of sports and artificial intelligence (AI), gathered from the Web of Science. The aim is to delineate the progression of AI applications in sports and to pinpoint current research focal points. Analyzing a corpus of 2,493 papers sourced from the Web of Science via CiteSpace, the findings reveal a year-on-year escalation in the application of AI within sports over the last twelve years (2010 to 2021). Machine learning has found extensive application in sports, notably in the analysis of athlete behavior, prediction of match outcomes, and physiological monitoring, among other areas. The evolution of sports and AI has witnessed two significant fluctuations within the past twelve years, specifically in 2011 and 2014. The modularity shift in 2011 indicated an uptick in the analysis of tasks and the identification of human activities. The year 2014 was marked as a pivotal moment with the advent of visualization utilization in team sports and wearable technologies. The study underscores the presence of numerous unexplored intellectual avenues within the sports and AI domain, which warrant further exploration in future research endeavors. Key milestones spanning from 2010 to 2021 are elucidated through visual analysis.

AB  - Introduction The objectives of this study are twofold. The first is to identify potential green infrastructure construction sites by building rooftops and sidewalks. The second is to analyze internal flooding for a wide range of drainage areas and to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of stormwater runoff control. Methods The target area has approximately 600 ha with a runoff coefficient of 0.71. Using Arc GIS Desktop 10.8.1, this study has identified green roofs and bioswales that would be highly beneficial in capturing large amounts of rainfall. In addition, Info Works ICM was used for the inundation analysis, which can simultaneously calculate the flow in sewer pipelines and above-ground inundation flow. Runoff coefficients were calculated for each land use using the urban land use subdivision mesh data with 100 m unit. This study targeted a 10-year probability rainfall (total rainfall: 86.3 mm, maximum hourly rainfall: 52.3 mm/h, duration: 3 h) with a middle concentrated rainfall waveform obtained from past experiments in the d4PDF database of ensemble climate prediction contributing to global warming. Results The amount of land availability for green roofs and bioswales was about 1 and 0.1% of the drainage area, respectively. The runoff coefficients for green roofs only, bioswales only, with and without introduction of both green roofs and bioswales were 70.34, 70.87, 70.28, and 70.93%, respectively. The difference in runoff coefficients was about 0.65 percentage points even when both were constructed. As a result of inundation analysis, the reduction was 2.5% for the maximum waterlogged area, 1.5% for the flooded area, and 0.7% for the average depth of waterlogging divided by the maximum waterlogged area. The construction of green roofs and bioswales in the same area or downstream of the area shows little mitigation effect when flooding occurs in an area near the downstream end of the sewer network. Discussion Although this study has mainly discussed the stormwater runoff control aspect, the most important feature of green infrastructure is its multifunctionality. In terms of utilizing and promoting green infrastructure, it is important to visualize its multifaceted effects and share them with many stakeholders.

AB  - The escalating dynamism of external pressures and the persistent demand from stakeholders for systems to maintain value amidst continuous change necessitates a re-evaluation of how system value is delivered. This literature review addresses the ambiguously defined concept of changeability, which spans domains, incorporates various 'ilities' and has in part impeded the formulation of effective comprehensive industry strategies. As a successful approach to cope with change, changeability involves the design of engineering systems that can continue to change, quickly (agile) and easily (flexible). This paper elucidates how changeability is defined, and the elements used to evaluate change in engineering systems. Subsequently, it reviews the methods and strategies employed to quantify, measure, and analyse changeability and change-related 'ilities'. An examination of various cases and applied research sets allowed the researchers to illustrate the roles, features and effects of changeability in the design of complex engineering systems throughout the entire lifecycle, thereby confirming and consolidating how changeability is both perceived and executed. Based on these findings, future research related to the quantification of changeability levels, and the cost implications associated are proposed, with an emphasis on utilising and integrating systems models (model-based systems engineering) to standardise and simplify implementation across various engineering systems.

AB  - The Biden administration openly declares Washington’s intention to “play offense, act more aggressively” against China, which, in its opinion, is an “unfriendly” country and pursues a policy of “military-civilian fusion” aimed at undermining American production and national security. In accordance with the doctrine of “precision decoupling”, the desire to “actively strangle large segments of the Chinese technology industry” becomes a priority instrument of pressure on China and is put above the commercial interests of American companies and concerns about the possible diplomatic or economic consequences of these steps. Subsidies, tax incentives, as well as regulations obliging American enterprises to use local raw materials, components and parts become the main instruments of competition designed to “put an end” to US dependence on imports of semiconductor products. The possibility of extending restrictions on the sale of almost any equipment containing at least a small proportion of American technologies is being studied. The actions of the Biden administration are based on the presumption of the existence of an insurmountable gap in the scientific and technical power of the United States and China. However, an objective analysis of the existing global economic relations in the semiconductor industry indicates a high degree of dependence of this industry in the United States on the state of cooperation with firms in China, Taiwan and South Korea. A radical restructuring of supply and logistics chains can lead to an increase in production costs and, ultimately, to disruptions in the US manufacturing sector. Despite the sanctions, China aims to increase its share in the semiconductor technology market and intends to concentrate resources on original and innovative scientific and technical research to pursue a course towards self-sufficiency.

AB  - The green vehicle routing problem (GVRP) is a relatively new topic, which aims to minimize greenhouse gasses (GHG) emissions produced by a fleet of vehicles. Both internal combustion vehicles (ICV) and alternative fuel vehicles (AFV) are considered, dividing GVRP into two separate subclasses: ICV-based GVRP and AFV-based GVRP. In the ICV-based subclass, the environmental aspect comes from the objective function which aims to minimize GHG emissions or fuel usage of ICVs. On the other hand, the environmental aspect of AFV-based GVRP is implicit and comes from using AFVs in transport. Since GVRP is NP-hard, finding the exact solution in a reasonable amount of time is often impossible for larger instances, which is why metaheuristic approaches are predominantly used. The purpose of this study is to detect gaps in the literature and present suggestions for future research in the field. For that purpose, we review recent papers in which GVRP was tackled by some metaheuristic methods and describe algorithm specifics, VRP attributes, and objectives used in them.

AB  - Due to the increase in scientific production, especially in recent years, management and decision support challenge also increase significantly. The task of recommending researchers, for example, to a project is not simple. Even with the proper amount of data, ranking and recommending researchers becomes a challenging process. Despite the different methods, what can happen is that the datasets of an institution or research areas do not have a ranking value, that is, a value that can be used to assess the position of a researcher. Even having a necessary dataset, there is no ranking information for these researchers, and this process of obtaining data for training a model can be costly. We propose to use clustering techniques to support the ranking process, reducing the human effort to obtain examples for models training. Then, we used this dataset to train the regression models and Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) to evaluate them. Tests demonstrate that our solution can support the researchers' recommendation process in an adaptive process to the needs of an organization.

AB  - This study examined the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) annual reports of selected logistics firms over the period from 2006 through 2021 for risk management terms. The purpose was to identify which risks are considered most important in supply chain logistics operations. Section 1A of the SEC reports includes risk factors. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a heavy impact on global supply chains. We also know that trucking firms have long had difficulties recruiting drivers. Fuel price has always been a major risk for airlines but also can impact shipping, trucking, and railroads. We were especially interested in pandemic, personnel, and fuel risks. We applied topic modeling, enabling us to identify some of the capabilities of unsupervised text mining as applied to SEC reports. We demonstrate the identification of terms, the time dimension, and correlation across topics by the topic model. Our analysis confirmed expectations about COVID-19’s impact, personnel shortages, and fuel. It also revealed common themes regarding the risks involved in international trade and perceived regulatory risks. We conclude with the supply chain management risks identified and discuss means of mitigation.

AB  - ABSTRACT ‘Word of mouth’ (WOM) as a communication tool has evolved quite significantly over the last few decades. Originally, word-of-mouth communication was limited to local coverage, i.e. it was restricted only to the closest people in the circle of the sender of the message. Technological developments over the past 30 years, particularly in computer and mobile technologies, have brought about significant changes in this form of communication. The information provided has become global; the consumer can communicate directly with the entrepreneur. Examples of bibliographic analyses of only electronic word of mouth (eWOM) without consideration of traditional WOM can be found in the literature. It therefore seems important to try to analyse the literature collection on both WOM and eWOM. The article aims to identify and present the most frequently cited works (along with their authors), as well as the publications most frequently referred to by authors publishing works related to WOM. Citation analysis and co-citation analysis were used to realise the stated aim. The basis for the analyses is a collection of publications from the WoS database. The results obtained made it possible to identify and create a list of the most frequently cited and co-cited publications.

AB  - The application of Information Technology (IT) in education has opened new scenarios for this ancient process. With rapidly changing field of IT, the adoption of IT in education has been changed drastically. It is quite difficult for researchers to keep pace with changing research trends. An analysis based on the keywords could provide a synopsis on the use of IT in education. The keywords can be extracted and clustered to draw a sketch of trend changes over time. In this paper, we propose two empirical methods based on classic TF/IDF, i.e., overall rating (OR) and dynamic character (DC) of a keyword for in-depth keyword analysis to examine changing trends in research. The method help in disclosing time based changes in research focuses by comparing TF/IDF weights of keywords in different years. A total of 8131 scholarly articles from 12 well recognized journals were used in this analysis. The analysis shows that proposed methods provide sufficient insight into the research trends of application of IT in education in 11 years, i.e., 2007-2017.

AB  - Abstract Figures are an essential part of scientific communication. Yet little is understood about how accessible (e.g., color-blind safe), readable (e.g., good contrast), and explainable (e.g., contain captions and legends) they are. We develop computational techniques to measure these features and analyze a large sample of them from open access publications. Our method combines computer and human vision research principles, achieving high accuracy in detecting problems. In our sample, we estimated that around 20.6% of publications contain either accessibility, readability, or explainability issues (around 2% of all figures contain accessibility issues, 3% of diagnostic figures contain readability issues, and 23% of line charts contain explainability issues). We release our analysis as a dataset and methods for further examination by the scientific community.

AB  - A Covid-19, por sua alta taxa de transmissão fez com que a Organização Mundial de Saúde decretasse estado de pandemia, sua circulação gerou muitas consequências econômicas, sanitárias e psicossociais, o que criou a necessidade de ações rápidas e assertivas das autoridades competentes. Ferramentas de tomada de decisão como por exemplo os modelos matemáticos preditivos, são necessárias para mitigar os riscos envolvidos nas decisões em tempos de pandemia. O objetivo desta pesquisa é verificar por meio da bibliometria se a comunidade científica tem utilizado a lógica fuzzy, que se torna conveniente ante incertezas, aplicada a estudos da Covid-19 no Brasil e no mundo. Pesquisas biliométricas podem ser úteis pois medem diversas variáveis das pesquisas publicadas em periódicos científicos pelo mundo e através de bases de dados científicas, portanto, são ferramentas que ajudam a direcionar possíveis novas pesquisas e acompanhar a evolução dos temas em estudo. Dentre as observações realizadas nesta pesquisa, viu-se que no momento da extração dos dados e com os critérios adotados, que o Brasil possuía apenas 10 publicações de estudos da Covid-19 com o uso de lógica fuzzy, o que pode ser considerado pouco se comparado a países asiáticos como a China e a Índia por exemplo, portanto é possível que haja muito espaço para pesquisas em nosso país que abordem o assunto.

AB  - Abstract As “big and broad” social media data continues to expand and become a more prevalent source for research, much remains to be understood about its epistemological and methodological implications. Drawing on an original data set of 12,732 research articles using social media data, we employ a novel dictionary-based approach to map the use of methods. Specifically, our approach draws on a combination of manual coding and embedding-enhanced query expansion. We cluster journals in groups of densely connected research communities to investigate how heterogeneous these groups are in terms of the methods used. First, our results indicate that research in this domain is largely organized by methods. Some communities tend to have a monomethod culture, and others combine methods in novel ways. Comparing practices across communities, we observe that computational methods have penetrated many research areas but not the research space surrounding ethnography. Second, we identify two core axes of variation—social sciences vs. computer science and methodological individualism vs. relationalism—that organize the domain as a whole, suggesting new methodological divisions and debates.

AB  - Abstract: Soft robotics is a subfield of robotics that concerns the design, control, and fabrication of robots composed of complaint materials, instead of rigid links. In contrast to the rigid-bodied robots built from metals, ceramics, and hard plastics, the compliance of soft robots can improve their safety when working in close contact with humans. The main objective of this project is to pluck flowers using a soft robot. The proposed system is designed to provide gentle manipulation of flowers in a horticultural setting. The soft robot is composed of flexible and deformable materials, such as silicone or elastomer, and is designed to mimic the motion and compliance of human fingers. The system is implemented and tested in a real-world scenario, and the results show that it can effectively pluck flowers without causing damage or injury to the plant. The proposed approach has potential applications in the floriculture industry, where the system can improve efficiency and reduce labour costs, while also minimizing damage to the flowers

AB  - Cities never function in isolation but as nodes in overarching systems characterised by flows of goods, people, and information. To fully understand the evolution of cities, a relational approach is needed, which investigates cities in relation to other cities and urban regions. While a significant part of urban system research has focused on aspects such as the concentration of populations and economic activities, the understanding of the actual networks connecting cities and their impact is still limited. However, the required data is notoriously difficult to obtain. This dissertation contributes to knowledge on the relationship between cities in the Netherlands by exploiting – in novel ways – three data sources: web pages mentioning cities, local historical newspapers, and administrative registers. After providing an overview of the systems of cities literature, the toponym co-occurrences method is explored. This method aims at identifying patterns of relations between cities in a systematic way by looking at the co-mentions of cities in text documents (here in web pages). Using text as data appeared as a great direction for studying urban systems, and elements from this first exploration are used in the next section of the thesis where the past dynamics of the Dutch urban system is reconstructed using information flows retrieved from digitised historical newspapers. Finally in a last empirical part, the potential of information from individual-level registers about professional and residential trajectories for measuring relations between places at multiple spatial scales is investigated. This measure is then used to reveal the nested hierarchy of functional regions in the Netherlands.

AB  - The problem of identifying common concepts in the sciences and deciding when new ideas have emerged is an open one. Metascience researchers have sought to formalize principles underlying stages in the life cycle of scientific research, understand how knowledge is transferred between scientists and stakeholders, and explain how new ideas are generated and take hold. Here, we model the state of scientific knowledge immediately preceding new directions of research as a metastable state and the creation of new concepts as combinatorial innovation. Through a novel approach combining natural language clustering and citation graph analysis, we predict the evolution of ideas over time and thus connect a single scientific article to past and future concepts in a way that goes beyond traditional citation and reference connections.

AB  - The decrease in oil production, the rise in environmental pollution, and the impending need to power areas in Colombia that do not currently have access to electricity have given the nation the task of finding new, decentralized, sustainable energy generation methods. Due to its favorable geographic location, renewable energy sources are a very appealing and affordable option in Colombia. This document presents a systematic literature review (SLR) developed to assess the recent techno-economic models and financial strategies in rural electrification using renewable energy systems. As a result, 19 documents were obtained, where the most informed funding sources included governmental, private and mixed shares. According to the information, the financial models were limited to estimate economic variables as levelized cost of electricity and net present cost. Finally, an emphasis on the need of governmental support to promote this kind of projects were reported.

To overcome the barriers and crown the assets with their proper management, dynamic applications of digital tools and techniques of Industry 4.0 need to emerge in the construction industry. Therefore, this study aims to present an integrative approach that combines quantitative and qualitative analysis techniques to critically review the available literature on the potential contributions of digital construction technologies to building economics through the post-design phases of the life cycle. The primary focus of the investigation is how digital technologies can overcome prevalent problems and how they can impact building economics. The study contributes to the field by providing an awareness that will inform researchers and practitioners of the trends, gaps, and more profound exchange of ideas in future research efforts.

AB  - This study aims at forming research teams for interinstitutional collaborations. Research institutes have their own purposes and topics of interest. Thus, supporting joint research between multiple institutes, we have to consider not only synergies between scholars but also purposes of the institutes. To solve this problem, we propose a bibliographic network embedding method that can learn characteristics of institutes, not only of each scholar. First, we compose a bibliographic network that consists of scholars, publications, venues, research projects, and institutes. Collaboration styles and research topics of institutes and scholars are extracted by mining subgraphs from the bibliographic network. Then, vector representations of network nodes are learned based on occurrences of subgraphs on the nodes and neighborhoods of the nodes. Based on the vector representations, we train multilayer perceptrons (MLP) to assess collaboration probability between scholars affiliated in different institutes. For training the MLP, we suggest three strategies: (i) considering every collaboration, (ii) focusing on interinstitutional collaborations, and (iii) focusing on collaboration outcomes. To evaluate the proposed methods, we have analyzed research collaborations of POSTECH (Pohang University of Science and Technology) and RIST (Research Institute of Industrial Science and Technology) from 2011 to 2020. Then, we conducted the research team formation for joint research of the two institutes according to two purposes: pure research and commercialization research.

AB  - The aim of this literature review is to suggest future research on industrial symbiosis. This study is based on the analysis of the latent topics related with the industrial symbiosis found in a collection of 611 scientific articles retrieved from Web of Science on 2022/3/11. Our research process applies the topic modelling technique, which allows the grouping of documents that discuss similar topics, even if these topics are not explicitly mentioned in the documents themselves The initial classification of the existing body of works made it possible to identify current trends and developments in the field and the most promising lines of future research. Specifically, we identified 12 themes, which we characterised with a short sentence rather than a single label. Among the 12 themes, we have highlighted those that are attracting increasing attention from scholars, while others are declining or remaining stable over time.

AB  - Scholarly publications are among the most tangible forms of knowledge production. Therefore, it is important to analyse them, amongst other features, for gender or country differences and the incumbent inequalities. While there are many quantitative studies of publication activities and success in terms of publication numbers and citation counts, a more content-related understanding of differences in the choice of research topics is rare. The present paper suggests an innovative method of using term communities in co-occurrence networks for detecting and evaluating the gender- and country-specific distribution of topics in research publications. The method is demonstrated with a pilot study based on approximately a quarter million of publication abstracts in seven diverse research areas. In this example, the method validly reconstructs all obvious topic preferences, for instance, country-dependent language-related preferences. It also produces new insight into country-specific research focuses. It emerges that in all seven subject areas studied, topic preferences are significantly different depending on whether all authors are women, all authors are men, or there are female and male co-authors, with a tendency of male authors towards theoretical core topics, of female authors towards peripheral applied topics, and of mixed-author teams towards modern interdisciplinary topics.

AB  - Forest ecological benefit compensation protects the ecological environment, increases enthusiasm among forest ecological builders, protects the legitimate economic interests of forest landowners, and maintains environmental security. In this study, a systematic analysis was conducted on 4062 publications in the field of international forest ecological benefit compensation identified using the Web of Science core collection Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E) and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) databases alongside CiteSpace optical measurement software. The research status and influence of countries were tracked, scientific research institutions and important authors were identified, and interdisciplinary and scientific hotspots were analyzed. The results show that the number of studies in this field has significantly increased over time and has strong development potential. The journals and articles presenting cutting-edge research in this field are all considered highly professional. The selected research is highly interdisciplinary but primarily involves environmental science and ecology. Despite the publication volume of China ranking second among the top 10 countries, its average citation volume was the lowest, indicating the urgent need to increase the international influence of China. Forest biodiversity, ecosystem services, and climate change are current research hotspots in this field. Dynamic changes in forest ecological benefit compensation and the driving forces behind its evolution are of great concern to researchers.

AB  - Over the last decade, event prediction has drawn attention from both academic and industry communities, resulting in a substantial volume of scientific papers published in a wide range of journals by scholars from different countries and disciplines. However, thus far, a comprehensive and systematic survey of recent literature has been lacking to quantitatively capture the research progress as well as emerging trends in the event prediction field. Aiming at addressing this gap, we employed CiteSpace software to analyze and visualize data retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database, including authors, documents, research institutions, and keywords, based on which the author co-citation network, document co-citation network, collaborative institution network, and keyword co-occurrence network were constructed. Through analyzing the aforementioned networks, we identified areas of active research, influential literature, collaborations at the national level, interdisciplinary patterns, and emerging trends by identifying the central nodes and the nodes with strong citation bursts. It reveals that sensor data has been widely used for predicting weather events and meteorological events (e.g., monitoring sea surface temperature and weather sensor data for predicting El Nino). The real-time and multivariable monitoring features of sensor data enable it to be a reliable source for predicting multiple types of events. Our work offers not only a comprehensive survey of the existing studies but also insights into the development trends within the event prediction field. These findings will assist researchers in conducting further research in this area and draw a large readership among academia and industrial communities who are engaged in event prediction research.

AB  - This paper proposes new ideas to be implemented in the design of intelligent decision support systems (IDSSs) for the management of industrial risks and safety.This class of information systems links different departments of an enterprise in case of emergency and supports multiple threat management.It can also cover financial risk management and long-term resilience planning.The first idea consists of the active use of AI alignment principles in the design of IDSSs, while taking into account the best AI technologies available to the developer and expected adversarial technologies.According to the AIalignment paradigm, the AI evolution is modelled to identify the most suitable techniques to solve security, safety and risk management problems within a given time frame.This approach is aimed at enterprise resilience building with system design and can be combined with DevOps.The other idea consists of ensuring optimal emergency action planning by adjusting the IDSS features to cyber-human capabilities and the technical background of an emergency response.This type of alignment applies anticipatory networks to model ad hoc organizational structures created to handle crisis situations, including natural disasters, technical accidents, as well as anthropogenic threats.The above ideas have been applied to the IDSS design for a large industrial plant.

AB  - ABSTRACT The health care system encompasses the participation of individuals, groups, agencies, and resources that offer services to address the requirements of the person, community, and population in terms of health. Parallel to the rising debates on the healthcare systems in relation to diseases, treatments, interventions, medication, and clinical practice guidelines, the world is currently discussing the healthcare industry, technology perspectives, and healthcare costs. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the healthcare systems research paradigm, we offered a novel contextual topic modeling approach that links up the CombinedTM model with our healthcare Bert to discover the contextual topics in the domain of healthcare. This research work discovered 60 contextual topics among them fifteen topics are the hottest which include smart medical monitoring systems, causes, and effects of stress and anxiety, and healthcare cost estimation and twelve topics are the coldest. Moreover, thirty-three topics are showing in-significant trends. We further investigated various clusters and correlations among the topics exploring inter-topic distance maps which add depth to the understanding of the research structure of this scientific domain. The current study enhances the prior topic modeling methodologies that examine the healthcare literature from a particular disciplinary perspective. It further extends the existing topic modeling approaches that do not incorporate contextual information in the topic discovery process adding contextual information by creating sentence embedding vectors through transformers-based models. We also utilized corpus tuning, the mean pooling technique, and the hugging face tool. Our method gives a higher coherence score as compared to the state-of-the-art models (LSA, LDA, and Ber Topic).

AB  - Delineating the flood extent using SAR data has been an unexceptional activity since the launch of the first sensors. The methodologies applied to image classification vary in complexity and accuracy and, for Sentinel-1, the technical procedures must be adapted considering their polarization, band, temporal resolution, and other factors. Considering these aspects, this article aimed to realize a systematic literature review discussing the most frequent methodologies applied to flood mapping classification employing Sentinel-1 data; describe the preferred methods by areas of expertise; and, inform about their accuracy level. Results indicate that thresholding is the most common methodologies used to flood delineation whatsoever is the researcher area of work. Excellent accuracy levels (reaching 99%) can be obtained using thresholding as the major method, with refinement provided by additional procedures to correct limitations and misclassification. The Sentinel-1data is a good source of information to realize classification in flooded areas but has its limitations in small areas. The choice of methodology for processing SAR data is subjective and requires specific knowledge in the remote sensing field from who executes a hydrological study.Keywords: Flood mapping, thresholding, synthetic aperture radar, remote sensing. Delineamento de extensão de inundação usando dados Sentinel-1 como fonte de informação: revisão sistemática dos métodos de processamento RESUMODelinear a extensão da inundação usando dados SAR tem sido uma atividade comum desde o lançamento dos primeiros sensores. As metodologias aplicadas à classificação de imagens variam em complexidade e precisão e, para o satélite Sentinel-1, os procedimentos técnicos devem ser adaptados considerando sua polarização, banda, resolução temporal, entre outros fatores. Considerando esses aspectos, este artigo teve como objetivo realizar uma revisão sistemática de literatura discutindo as metodologias frequentemente aplicadas à classificação do mapeamento de inundações empregando dados do Sentinel-1; descrever os métodos preferidos por áreas de especialização do analista; e, informar sobre seu nível de precisão. Os resultados indicam que a limiarização é a metodologia mais comum utilizada para o delineamento de inundação, seja qual for a área de trabalho do pesquisador. Excelentes níveis de precisão (cerca de 99%) podem ser obtidos usando a limiarização como o método principal, com refinamento fornecido por procedimentos adicionais para corrigir limitações e erros de classificação. Os dados do Sentinel-1 são uma boa fonte de informação para realizar a classificação em áreas inundadas, mas têm suas limitações em áreas pequenas. A escolha da metodologia para o processamento de dados SAR revela-se subjetiva, inerente ao campo de estudo do pesquisador, e requer conhecimento específico na área de sensoriamento remoto de quem executa um estudo hidrológico.Palavras-chave: Mapeamento de inundação, limiarização, radar de abertura sintética, sensoriamento remoto.

AB  - This study aims to determine the relationship between inflation and the independence of central banks in post-Soviet, developed, and developing countries. The hypothesis of a negative statistical relationship between the inflation rate and the values of the CWN and GMT central bank independence indices and their constituent subindices for post-Soviet, developed, and developing countries for 2001–2020 was tested. Based on the results of the econometric assessment, the paper finds that high values of the central bank independence indices and their sub-indices help to keep inflation in a certain corridor: if inflation is high, central bank independence reduces it, and if inflation is low, it helps to keep inflation at a low level. The impact of central bank independence on inflation weakens as inflation decreases.

AB  - Promoting safe behaviors among construction workers and mitigating unsafe behaviors is an effective approach to enhancing safety performance in the construction industry. Although progress has been made, the research themes concerning construction workers’ safety-related behaviors (CWSRB) and the detailed progress of each theme remain unclear due to differences in review perspectives and conceptual scopes. This study utilized CiteSpace software (V6.2R3 version) to conduct an analysis of co-authorship networks, co-word networks, and co-citations on 563 published articles in this field from 2013 to 2023. This study’s outcomes highlight several key insights: (1) journals such as Safety Science play a pivotal role in the domain; (2) institutions such as the City University of Hong Kong and Hong Kong Polytechnic University, along with prolific authors like Li, are major contributors to the field; (3) the focus of research has evolved from early organizational factors towards a more diverse range of topics, with deep learning emerging as a significant current research hotspot; (4) this study has identified high-cited literature and 11 primary clusters within the field. Current research focuses on five areas: safety-related behavior concepts, influencing factors and consequences, formation mechanisms, interventions, and applications of new technologies. Establishing clear classification criteria for unsafe behaviors, comprehensively understanding the formation mechanisms of safety-related behaviors, evaluating the effectiveness of intervention strategies, and exploring the practical applications of new technologies are future research directions. This study provides researchers with a holistic view of the present state of research and potential avenues for future exploration, thereby deepening the knowledge and comprehension of stakeholders within this domain.

AB  - Information behavior describes the many ways in which human beings interact with information – how people seek and utilize information, but also includes other activities such as avoiding/stopping, distorting, encountering by chance, organizing, storing, creating, sharing, diffusing, and deciding to stop using information. Prior studies have attempted to review the history of information seeking and information behavior research in the past 50-60 years. While there have been recent studies looking at different aspects of information behavior, there is a need to bring the key conclusions from these together in one place. &nbsp;This paper seeks to answer the question, “What is the trajectory of information behavior research in the 21st century? What are some of the future directions?” The unit of analysis is research articles published on information behavior between the years 2000 and 2023. These include papers published in Information Research, the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, and those presented in Information Seeking in Context conferences and the Annual Meetings of the Association for Information Science and Technology, and research on information behavior models and context. While not meant to be exhaustive, this paper should bring new and existing researchers up to speed on some of the recent developments in the field during the past two decades.

AB  - In recent years, the recognition of hot topics and the analysis of their evolution path in the frontier of a field have received widespread attention from the academic community. It can not only reveal the development trend of a certain field but also discover the evolution law of topic content in different development stages of the field. However, there are still some problems in some current research methods, such as inaccurate recognition of hot topics and unclear evolution path, which seriously affect the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the analysis. To solve the above problems, the paper uses LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model to propose a hot topic recognition and evolution analysis method, which aims to reveal the evolution law of topic content level in different development stages of the field, such as inheritance, merging, division, and other topic evolution trends so as to provide decision support for domain knowledge innovation services. LDA adopts the Gibbs symmetric sampling method, which can make the adopted data converge, and under the given conditions, the data is symmetrical in the high-dimensional space structure, which makes the analysis result more accurate. Main research process: Firstly, LDA is used to extract global topics and stage topics. Second, the topics are filtered using a similarity calculation algorithm. Thirdly, novelty and support are used to recognize hot topics. Finally, three paths of inheritance evolution, merging evolution, and division evolution are formed for hot topics.

AB  - Whether behavioural economics has a fundamental influence on economics is debated by behavioural and heterodox economists as well as by methodologists and historians of economics. At the core of this debate is the question whether behavioural economics is shaped by large-scale content imports from psychology, or whether these transfers have been too selective to challenge dominant approaches in economics. This study contributes to the debate in analysing a variety of bibliographic data from the disciplinary boundary between economics and psychology. Two datasets from the boundary of behavioural economics and psychology are compared to sets of economic and psychology publications in quantifying the use of mathematics, the share of empirical contributions, the authors’ academic background, and their cross-citations via network analysis. In contrast to proposals made by some methodologists and behavioural economists, the statistical results confirm content transfers from psychology via behavioural economics only to a limited extend. The observed level of interaction provides evidence for a selective import of specific psychological findings by a small number of established investigators in behavioural economics. These findings were then intensively debated as divergences from rationality within the growing, but econ-centered community of behavioural economists.

AB  - For decades, cancer has remained a persistent health challenge; this project represents a significant stride towards refining treatment approaches and prognostic insights. Proton beam therapy, a radiation therapy modality employing high-energy protons to target various malignancies while minimizing damage to adjacent healthy tissue, holds immense promise. This study analyzes the relationship between delivered radiation doses and patient outcomes, using various approximation functions and graphical representations for comparison. Statistical analysis is performed through the Monte Carlo method based on repeated sampling to estimate the variables of interest in this analysis, namely, the survival rates, financial implications, and medical effectiveness of proton beam therapy. To this end, open-source data from research centers that publish patient outcomes were utilized. The second study considered the estimation of pay gaps that can have long-lasting effects, leading to differences in retirement savings, wealth accumulation, and overall financial security. After finding a representative sample containing the relevant variables that contribute to pay gaps, such as gender, race, experience, education, and job role, MC modeling is used to simulate a range of possible pay gap estimates. Based on the Monte Carlo results, a sensitivity analysis is performed to identify which variables have the most significant impact on pay gaps.

AB  - Identifying hotspot words associated with disease symptoms is paramount for disease prevention and diagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel method for hotspot word recognition in disease symptoms, integrating contextual weights and co-occurrence information. First, we establish the MDERank model, which incorporates contextual weights. This model identifies words that align well with comprehensive weights, forming a collection of disease symptom words. Next, we construct a graph network for disease symptom words within each time period. Utilizing the graph attention network model, we incorporate word co-occurrence degree to identify potential hotspot words associated with disease symptoms. We conducted experiments using user-generated posts from the Dingxiangyuan Forum as our data source. The results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the extraction quality of disease symptom words compared to other existing methods. Furthermore, the performance of our constructed recognition model for disease symptom hotspot words surpasses that of alternative models.

AB  - Detection and identification become the prediction of future research hotspots in the discipline, which is important to grasp the current status and development trend of the discipline research. In this paper, we use the cumulative topic heat model to calculate the research heat of each research topic in intelligence science from 2000 to 2020 and use the first 70% of the data as the training set, use the LSTM model for prediction, and construct the ECM model for error correction. The actual topic hotness of intelligence science for the latter 30% of data was used as the validation set to verify the effectiveness of the method. It was found that the average deviation rate of the method's prediction results fluctuated between 9.75% and 12.68%, and the average number of error entries was about 0.161, which had high validity. The study also predicts that by 2025, topics such as “crisis warning” and “health information services” in intelligence will continue to rise in popularity and “scientific data” and “data mining” will continue to rise in popularity. The hotness of “data mining” will remain stable, while the hotness of “citation analysis” and “ontology” will gradually decline.

AB  - Mathematical ranking plays a critical role in the era of the internet and bigdata. Google's PageRank is well-known as a trillion-dollar algorithm. Definitely, algorithmic ranking frameworks are found on every search engine. In this paper, the article shall investigate how PageRank can be applied in the blockchain space to build up reliable and verifiable social credit and reputation systems. It is expected to provide a measure of credibility complementary and parallel with FICO, which is not applicable for individuals lacking credit information in financial institutions. Moreover, the approach proposes an unbiased method of interpreting and measuring real social interaction and reputation ranking on a blockchain network. The authors envision a future of payment based on cryptocurrencies (especially stable coins) and digital fiats; thus the proposed credit scoring framework shall be helpful for P2P credit and lending networks, possibly for decentralized finance (Defi) applications.

AB  - Crises globais, como pandemias e guerras, evidenciam como os projetos de construção são afetados por eventos inesperados, normalmente ignorados pelas equipes de planejamento. Portanto, o objetivo deste estudo é revisar a literatura para entender como as incertezas são consideradas nos métodos de planejamento de obra e quais são as próximas etapas para enfrentar novas crises. Assim, os autores mapearam as variáveis tradicionais que são incluídas como incertezas nos métodos de planejamento, como tempo e custo do projeto, bem como as variáveis incomuns que não são normalmente incluídas como incertezas nos métodos, como questões de segurança e sustentabilidade. O estado da arte dos métodos de planejamento com incertezas envolveu uma leitura minuciosa de 103 artigos de periódicos encontrados por meio de uma revisão sistemática adaptada da literatura, que incluiu, além dos processos tradicionais, um estudo cienciométrico e uma análise de bola de neve. Como resultado, descobriu-se que as principais incertezas consideradas estão relacionadas a tempo, custo e recursos. Além disso, foi possível observar que não existe uma única técnica consolidada para incorporar incertezas nos métodos de planejamento, mas sim uma combinação de diferentes técnicas, desde as mais tradicionais com análise analítica até as mais contemporâneas com algoritmos de inteligência artificial.

AB  - Colletotrichum kahawae (Coffee Berry Disease) spreads through spores that can be carried by wind, rain, and insects affecting coffee plantations, and causes 80% yield losses and poor-quality coffee beans. The deadly disease is hard to control because wind, rain, and insects carry spores. Colombian researchers utilized a deep learning system to identify CBD in coffee cherries at three growth stages and classify photographs of infected and uninfected cherries with 93% accuracy using a random forest method. If the dataset is too small and noisy, the algorithm may not learn data patterns and generate accurate predictions. To overcome the existing challenge, early detection of Colletotrichum Kahawae disease in coffee cherries requires automated processes, prompt recognition, and accurate classifications. The proposed methodology selects CBD image datasets through four different stages for training and testing. XGBoost to train a model on datasets of coffee berries, with each image labeled as healthy or diseased. Once the model is trained, SHAP algorithm to figure out which features were essential for making predictions with the proposed model. Some of these characteristics were the cherry's colour, whether it had spots or other damage, and how big the Lesions were. Virtual inception is important for classification to virtualize the relationship between the colour of the berry is correlated with the presence of disease. To evaluate the model's performance and mitigate excess fitting, a 10-fold cross-validation approach is employed. This involves partitioning the dataset into ten subsets, training the model on each subset, and evaluating its performance. In comparison to other contemporary methodologies, the model put forth achieved an accuracy of 98.56%.

AB  - In order to find significant patterns and fresh ideas, free-form content is transformed into structured format using a process known as text mining or text data mining. It enables businesses to easily locate important information in texts like emails, social media posts, support requests, chatbots, and other sorts of text. Text mining enables businesses to anticipate possible threats from rivals, react quickly to production or delivery problems, and provide more individualised customer service. Businesses employ text mining for a range of functions, including production, IT, marketing, sales, and customer service. By carefully examining the phrases used in the source texts, topic modelling aims to pinpoint the recurrent themes in a corpus. These concepts are known as “topics”. As a result, textual data may be measured and used in quantitative analysis. In this sector, there are several subject modelling kinds that differ from one another based on a few unique traits and criteria. In our paper we have represented mainly 3 types of topic modelling techniques namely Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP), and Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) and calculated the coherence score of each method and compared them. And we have infused the concept of BERT with this topic modelling models and proposed a new model called HDP BERT and calculated the coherence Score and clusters the topics. At the end the n-grams features are applied to all 4 models and compared among each other in bases of uni, bi and trigram rate percentage.

This paper presents a methodology for developing these kinds of systems in a lightweight, modular, and flexible way with a particular focus on providing powerful search tools in domains where non-expert users encounter challenges in exploring the data repository at hand. Using an academic expertise finder tool as a case study, we demonstrate how this methodology allows us to leverage powerful off-the-shelf technology to enable the rapid, low-cost development of semantic search engines, while also affording developers with the necessary flexibility to embed user-centric design in their development in order to maximise uptake and application value.

AB  - In order to advance civil aircraft manufacturing to higher levels, there is an urgent need to identify technological innovation opportunities to help new technology development. This paper first analyses the current state of the research field and determines the topic. It preprocesses papers and patents within the research topic to obtain a base database. Then, the database is analyzed using the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Analysis) cluster analysis method. The TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm processes the data to obtain critical technical words. The abstracts of patents and papers are processed to construct a binary-based vector of technical keywords. The papers and patents are visualized in a two-dimensional space technology map by generative topographic mapping (GTM) to create a technology map to identify technology blank dots. The combination of technologies characterized by each technology blank dot is obtained by GTM inverse mapping. Finally, technology opportunities with a high probability of development are identified to achieve innovation opportunity identification. It also provides countermeasures for the research institution, enterprise, sector, and industry. After research and analysis, the future in the mechanical connection technology of civil aircraft is necessary to strengthen basic technology development and improve the study of intelligence, integration, and flexibility. Technology such as sensors and lasers can improve the precision and efficiency of mechanical connections.

AB  - Abstract It has been acknowledged that global challenges are in the way of delivering responsible innovation, as reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals – a set of strategic objectives formulated by the United Nations General Assembly, to promote environmentally, societally, and economically-sustainable development. Design higher education has an important role to play in equipping the next generation of professionals with knowledge and skills for tackling pressing system-level challenges. Sustainable design research and ways of integrating emerging technologies in future design higher education curricula have, separately, attracted significant interest in recent years. However, comparatively little effort has concentrated on the role that a broader range of technologies can play in shaping the design higher education provision with system-level sustainability challenges in mind. This article presents an analysis of 180 Design MSc dissertation projects, implemented at a UK higher education institution between 2019 and 2022, focusing on research challenges of societal and industrial relevance. The data set includes a mapping of dissertation projects to relevant technologies, industry sectors, and Sustainable Development Goals. Data analysis suggests a balanced distribution of projects across a range of sustainability goals, although under-represented thematic areas have also been highlighted. The methods adopted for this study, based on a systematic study of relational patterns reflecting associations of dissertation projects with technologies, industry sectors, and sustainability goals, provide a blueprint for future data-driven research on the role played by technologies within student projects in design higher education, with an emphasis on their relevance to sustainable innovation challenges.

AB  - In academia, it is rare for an event or issue to foster the extensive participation of multiple disciplines. Research related to COVID-19 has undeniably yielded a wealth of valuable insights and impetus for the progress of interdisciplinary research, encompassing concepts, methodologies, intellectual approaches, theories, frameworks, data integration and analysis, and pertinent considerations. In the academic community, there is a widespread expectation that as science and technology continue to progress, the convergence of medicine with various other fields will gain momentum. Fields like computer science are anticipated to see expanded applications in domains such as medicine, vaccine research, disease diagnosis, and more. This study aims to examine interdisciplinary approaches in health-related research, particularly in the context of COVID-19. The goal is to analyze and comprehend the involvement and collaboration patterns of various disciplines in pandemic research, with a specific emphasis on the role and integration level of computer science. This study analyzed 240,509 COVID-19 related articles published from December 2019 to September 2022 using methods such as chord diagrams, modularity analysis, and eigenvector centrality analysis in Social Networking Analysis (SNA). The findings revealed an emerging trend of integration trend between Humanities &amp; Social Sciences and Natural Sciences. Expectations that computer science would prominently feature in pandemic research during this technology-driven era haven’t materialized. While it maintains links with engineering, it hasn’t formed strong connections with medicine. This indicates a gap between computer science and core medical research in large-scale health crises, where COVID-19 research remains centered on medicine with varying interdisciplinary collaboration, and high-tech disciplines like computer science have not achieved their expected influence in these studies.

AB  - Patent analysis is a field that concerns the analysis of patent records, for the purpose of extracting insights and trends, and it is widely used in various fields. Despite the abundance of proprietary software employed for this purpose, there is currently a lack of easy-to-use and publicly available software that can offer simple and intuitive visualizations, while advocating for open science and scientific software development. In this study, we attempt to fill this gap by offering PatentInspector, an open-source, public tool that, by leveraging patent data from the United States Trademark and Patent Office, is able to produce descriptive analytics, thematic axes and citation network analysis. The use and interpretability of PatentInspector is illustrated through a use case on human resource management-related patents, highlighting its functionalities. The results indicate that PatentInspector is a practical resource for conducting patent analytics and can be used by individuals with a limited or no background in coding and software development.

AB  - Research papers reflect scientific advances. Citations are widely used in research publications to support the new findings and show their benefits, while also regulating the information flow to make the contents clearer for the audience. A citation in a research article refers to the information’s source, but not the specific text span from that source article. In biomedical research articles, this task is challenging as the same chemical or biological component can be represented in multiple ways in different papers from various domains. This paper suggests a mechanism for linking citing sentences in a publication with cited sentences in referenced sources. The framework presented here pairs the citing sentence with all of the sentences in the reference text, and then tries to retrieve the semantically equivalent pairs. These semantically related sentences from the reference paper are chosen as the cited statements. This effort involves designing a citation linkage framework utilizing sequential and tree-structured siamese deep learning models. This paper also provides a method to create a synthetic corpus for such a task.

AB  - In the rapidly evolving digital health landscape, technology plays a pivotal role in transforming the healthcare industry. With the exponential growth of data, uncovering valuable insights has become a daunting task. In today's data-driven world, healthcare businesses must leverage emerging technologies to stay informed about trends in their field. This research article presents a novel approach to deriving business insights in digital health enabled by technology, including artificial intelligence, and other cutting-edge advancements. We propose a methodology that utilizes news mining techniques and the global data on events, location, and tone database as the primary data source. By employing natural language processing, we developed a practical way of extracting relevant insights from vast amounts of public data. We implemented named-entity recognition (NER) enriched with the DBpedia knowledge base and relationship extraction. In addition, we leveraged graph analytics to identify and analyze the most significant concept relationships within the text corpus and their evolution in time. By integrating these advanced techniques, healthcare businesses can extract actionable insights from public datasets, empowering them to stay abreast of emerging trends and advancements in digital health, such as telehealth, precision medicine, or medical imaging.

AB  - One way to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change, is for society to move towards a biobased economy, where fossil resources are replaced by biobased ones. This replacement requires the development of biobased supply chains that differ significantly from the conventional supply chain. For example, seasonality and variability of the feedstocks create specific challenges for biobased systems and call for customized solutions for the design and operation of biobased chains. As a result, the modelling efforts to support decision-making processes for biobased logistics and supply chains have some different requirements. This paper presents a systematic literature review on logistics and supply chain modelling studies for the biobased economy published in a period of 2011–2020. The literature analysis shows that most modelling studies for the biobased economy are strategic optimization models aiming to minimize economic impact. As biomass source, forest and agricultural residues are mostly used, and fuel and energy are the most common biobased applications. Modelling strategies, biomass sources and applications are however diversifying, which is what we encourage for future research. Also, not only focusing on economic optimization but also optimizing social and environmental performance is an important future research direction, to deal with the sustainability challenges the world is facing.

AB  - Abstract Nowadays, literature review is a necessary task when trying to solve a given problem. However, an exhaustive literature review is very time-consuming in today’s vast literature landscape. It can take weeks, even if looking only for abstracts or surveys. Moreover, choosing a method among others, and targeting searches within relevant problem and solution domains, are not easy tasks. These are especially true for young researchers or engineers starting to work in their field. Even if surveys that provide methods used to solve a specific problem already exist, an automatic way to do it for any use case is missing, especially for those who don’t know the existing literature. Our proposed tool, SARBOLD-LLM, allows discovering and choosing among methods related to a given problem, providing additional information about their uses in the literature to derive decision-making insights, in only a few hours. The SARBOLD-LLM comprises three modules: (1: Scopus search) paper selection using a keyword selection scheme to query Scopus API; (2: Scoring and method extraction) relevancy and popularity scores calculation and solution method extraction in papers utilizing OpenAI API (GPT 3.5); (3: Analyzes) sensitivity analysis and post-analyzes which reveals trends, relevant papers and methods. Comparing the SARBOLD-LLM to manual ground truth using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, the performance results of AI in the oncology case study are 0.68, 0.9, and 0.77, respectively. SARBOLD-LLM demonstrates successful outcomes across various domains, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness. The SARBOLD-LLM addresses engineers more than researchers, as it proposes methods and trends without adding pros and cons. It is a useful tool to select which methods to investigate first and comes as a complement to surveys. This can limit the global search and accumulation of knowledge for the end user. However, it can be used as a director or recommender for future implementation to solve a problem.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, the scientific literature related to SARS-COV-2 has been growing dramatically. These literary items encompass a varied set of topics, ranging from vaccination to protective equipment efficacy as well as lockdown policy evaluations. As a result, the development of automatic methods that allow an in-depth exploration of this growing literature has become a relevant issue, both to identify the topical trends of COVID-related research and to zoom-in on its sub-themes. This work proposes a novel methodology, called LDA2Net , which combines topic modelling and network analysis, to investigate topics under their surface. More specifically, LDA2Net exploits the frequencies of consecutive words pairs (i.e. bigram ) to build those network structures underlying the hidden topics extracted from large volumes of text by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Results are promising and suggest that the topic model efficacy is magnified by the network-based representation. In particular, such enrichment is noticeable when it comes to displaying and exploring the topics at different levels of granularity.

AB  - Abstract Leveraging previously untapped data sources offers significant potential for value creation in the manufacturing sector. However, asset-heavy shop floors, extended machine replacement cycles, and equipment diversity necessitate considerable investments for achieving smart manufacturing, which can be particularly challenging for small businesses. Retrofitting presents a viable solution, enabling the integration of low-cost sensors and microcontrollers with older machines to collect and transmit data. In this paper, we introduce a concept and a prototype for retrofitting industrial environments using lightweight web technologies at the edge. Our approach employs WebAssembly as a novel bytecode standard, facilitating a consistent development environment from the cloud to the edge by operating on both browsers and bare-metal hardware. By attaining near-native performance and modularity reminiscent of container-based service architectures, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. Our prototype was evaluated with an actual industrial robot within a showcase factory, including measurements of data exchange with a cutting-edge data lake system. We further extended the prototype to incorporate a peer-to-peer network that facilitates message routing and WebAssembly software updates. Our technology establishes a foundational framework for the transition towards Industry 4.0. By integrating considerations of sustainability and human factors, it further extends this groundwork to facilitate progression into Industry 5.0.

AB  - Challenges to reproducibility and replicability have gained widespread attention, driven by large replication projects with lukewarm success rates. A nascent work has emerged developing algorithms to estimate the replicability of published findings. The current study explores ways in which AI-enabled signals of confidence in research might be integrated into the literature search. We interview 17 PhD researchers about their current processes for literature search and ask them to provide feedback on a replicability estimation tool. Our findings suggest that participants tend to confuse replicability with generalizability and related concepts. Information about replicability can support researchers throughout the research design processes. However, the use of AI estimation is debatable due to the lack of explainability and transparency. The ethical implications of AI-enabled confidence assessment must be further studied before such tools could be widely accepted. We discuss implications for the design of technological tools to support scholarly activities and advance replicability.

AB  - Abstract Citation network analysis attracts increasing attention from disciplines of complex network analysis and science of science. One big challenge in this regard is that there are unreasonable citations in citation networks, i.e., cited papers are not relevant to the citing paper. Existing research on citation analysis has primarily concentrated on the contents and ignored the complex relations between academic entities. In this paper, we propose a novel research topic, that is, how to detect anomalous citations. To be specific, we first define anomalous citations and propose a unified framework, named ACTION, to detect anomalous citations in a heterogeneous academic network. ACTION is established based on non-negative matrix factorization and network representation learning, which considers not only the relevance of citation contents but also the relationships among academic entities including journals, papers, and authors. To evaluate the performance of ACTION, we construct three anomalous citation datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Detecting anomalous citations carry profound significance for academic fairness.

AB  - Edge embedding is a technique for constructing low-dimensional feature vectors of edges in heterogeneous graphs, which are also called heterogeneous information networks (HINs). However, edge embedding research is still in its early stages, and few well-developed models exist. Moreover, existing models often learn features on the edge graph, which is much larger than the original network, resulting in slower speed and inaccurate performance. To address these issues, a multi-view learning-based fast edge embedding model is developed for HINs in this paper, called MVFEE. Based on the “divide and conquer” strategy, our model divides the global feature learning into multiple separate local intra-view features learning and inter-view features learning processes. More specifically, each vertex type in the edge graph (each edge type in HIN) is first treated as a view, and a private skip-gram model is used to rapidly learn the intra-view features. Then, a cross-view learning strategy is designed to further learn the inter-view features between two views. Finally, a multi-head attention mechanism is used to aggregate these local features to generate accurate global features of each edge. Extensive experiments on four datasets and three network analysis tasks show the advantages of our model.

AB  - This research is imperative due to the pressing need for improved patient recruitment in clinical trials, addressing challenges such as delays and high costs.By introducing a classification model and a game theoretic approach for clinical trial setting, we aim to boost trial efficiency, advance healthcare research, and enhance patient outcomes.This research is critical for revolutionizing recruitment strategies and accelerating medical progress.In this paper, we present a classification model that has been specifically designed to address this issue effectively.The proposed model employs an Autoencoder, augmented by a super classification model that merges Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest Trees, and Decision Trees using a stacking classifier.The output of the super classifier is further processed by a meta classifier to obtain the final result.Notably, the model achieves a training accuracy of 99.576% and a validation accuracy of 83.45%, illustrating its robust classification performance and its potential to streamline patient recruitment, reducing delays and resource consumption.In addition to the classification model, this study formulates a three-layer game theoretic model involving Patients, Doctors or Clinical Investigators, and Research Firms.Within this static repeated game setting, players sequentially strategize to optimize their recruitment strategies, while research firms aim to optimize their overall interaction.The paper proposes a novel optimal solution that strikingly balances the payoffs of all three players.Moreover, the work presents a necessary condition and closed form for the existence of an equilibrium in the game, offering a strategic approach to recruitment optimization, and striking a balance between stakeholders.This equilibrium-seeking solution has the potential to revolutionize recruitment dynamics and foster collaboration.Additionally, the study's theoretical contributions lay the groundwork for future research in this critical healthcare domain.

Az AVOBMAT szöveg- és adatbányászati eszköz újdonságai a következők: (i) számos nyelven képes előfeldolgozni, (szemantikusan) gazdagítani és elemezni metaadatokat és szövegeket; (ii) a beépített funkciók lehetőséget biztosítanak a szoros és távoli olvasásra egyaránt; (iii) egy felhasználóbarát, interaktív grafikus felületen integrál metaadat és szövegelemzéssel kapcsolatos kutatási eszközöket. A platformfüggetlen alkalmazás elsősorban olyan felhasználók számára lett kifejlesztve, akik nem rendelkeznek programozási ismeretekkel. Az egyszerűen használható felület interaktív paraméterbeállítást és vezérlést biztosít a normalizálást is támogató előfeldolgozástól az analitikai szakaszokig. A felhasználók interaktív módon kísérletezhetnek az elemzések különböző beállításaival a munkafolyamat során. Ezáltal az AVOBMAT segít felismerni a számítógépes szöveg- és adatelemzés episztemológiai kihívásait, korlátait és erősségeit, valamint kritikus módon értelmezni az alkalmazott módszereket és eredményeket.

AB  - Digitization and the digital humanities (DH) continue to shape the field of American studies. This forum brings together ten international scholars who assess where we as (German) Americanists stand on digital scholarship, (inter)disciplinarity, data, and publishing. Some of the statements collected here were originally presented during a digital town hall meeting of the German Association of American Studies (GAAS) on April 1, 2022; others were written specifically for this forum. Together, they discuss how digitization impacts our work environments, the role DH methods play in American studies, and the production, use, and sustainability of research data in the humanities. Contributors define DH and its connection to literary and cultural studies and trace its history in German American studies and beyond. Several contributions shed light on the (in)accessibility of digital publishing and practices of data tracking. They critically flag neoliberal logics of exploitative research designs but also point to collaborative endeavors and open-access formats as useful tools to resist them. The statements reflect and resume the conversation initiated in April 2022 to chart a possible direction for American studies.

AB  - In recent years, tensor decomposition has gained increasing interest in the field of link prediction, which aims to estimate the likelihood of new connections forming between nodes in a network. This study highlights the potential of the Canonical Polyadic tensor decomposition in enhancing link prediction in complex networks. It suggests effective tensor decomposition algorithms that not only take into account the structural characteristics of the network but also its temporal evolution. During the process of tensor decomposition, the initial tensor is decomposed into two-way tensors, also known as factor matrices, representing different modes of the data. These factor matrices capture the underlying patterns or relationships within the network, providing insights into the structure and dynamics of the network. For evaluation, we examine a dataset derived from the WSDM. After preprocessing, the data is represented as a multi-way tensor, with each mode representing different aspects such as users, items, and time. Our primary objective is to make precise predictions about the links between users and items within specific time periods. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves prediction accuracy for evolving networks, as measured by the AUC.

AB  - Current models for evaluating sustainable transport corridors often lack a comprehensive framework capturing the multifaceted performance measures vital for holistic assessment especially at the early stages of operation, when detailed information on the performance indicators of these transport corridors is not available. This gap motivates a Petri net-based modeling approach that integrates key sustainability indicators into a flexible simulation tool. This paper details a versatile methodology harnessing Petri nets, specifically Evaluation Petri nets (E-Nets), to assess corridor sustainability across environmental, social, and economic dimensions. The proposed framework equips planners and policymakers to explore diverse green corridor configurations under varying conditions. Case studies showcase the model’s capabilities in analyzing real-world corridors, identifying performance bottlenecks, and comparing alternative solutions. The model provides a practical decision-support tool to strengthen strategies for efficient, socially responsible, and environmentally sound transport infrastructure. This research advances the theoretical foundations and demonstrates the practical value of Petri nets as an enabling methodology for modeling the intricate dynamics of sustainable transport corridors. This paper demonstrates how E-Nets provide a visual and quantitative representation of transport operations, enabling stakeholders to identify inefficiencies and potential improvements. This paper discusses the theoretical underpinnings of the E-Net modeling of transport corridors, the advantages and limitations of its application, and suggests avenues for future research to enhance the model’s predictive power and real-world application. The paper concludes that the E-Net approach is a scalable, adaptable tool that can significantly con-tribute to the sustainable development of international transport corridors, providing a framework for continuous improvement in alignment with global sustainability objectives.

AB  - Digitization and the digital humanities (DH) continue to shape the field of American studies.This forum brings together ten international scholars who assess where we as (German) Americanists stand on digital scholarship, (inter)disciplinarity, data, and publishing.Some of the statements collected here were originally presented during a digital town hall meeting of the German Association of American Studies (GAAS) on April 1, 2022; others were written specifically for this forum.Together, they discuss how digitization impacts our work environments, the role DH methods play in American studies, and the production, use, and sustainability of research data in the humanities.Contributors define DH and its connection to literary and cultural studies and trace its history in German American studies and beyond.Several contributions shed light on the (in)accessibility of digital publishing and practices of data tracking.They critically flag neoliberal logics of exploitative research designs but also point to collaborative endeavors and open-access formats as useful tools to resist them.The statements reflect and resume the conversation initiated in April 2022 to chart a possible direction for American studies.
