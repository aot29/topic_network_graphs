AB  - The goal of this study is to comprehensively analyze the dynamics and structure of TikTok research since its initial development. The scholarly composition of articles dealing with TikTok was dissected via a bibliometric study based on a corpus of 542 journal articles from the Scopus database. The results show that TikTok research has flourished in recent years and also demonstrate that the authors’ collaboration networks are disjointed, indicating a lack of cooperation among TikTok researchers. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that research collaboration among academic institutions reflects the North-South divide, also highlighting a limited research collaboration between institutions in developed and developing countries. Based on the keyword co-occurrence network and topic modeling, TikTok research revolves mainly around five thematic areas, including public health, health communication and education, platform governance, body image, and its impact on children and students. Based on these findings, numerous suggestions for further research are offered. As far as the authors are aware, this is the first application of bibliometrics and topic modeling to assess the growth of TikTok research and reveal the intellectual base of this knowledge domain. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - This paper focuses on building a more precise and comprehensive understanding of the state of social entrepreneurship (SE) research by using an integrated bibliometric and unsupervised machine learning approach. Bibliometric analysis, along with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling enables us to identify key trends and themes in the SE domain. This approach is superior to tools and methods used in the past, which primarily employed systematic literature reviews and bibliometric analysis. While systematic manual literature reviews become impractical as the literature grows, bibliometric analysis focuses on the most cited articles, ignoring recent influential work, suffering from citation biases, and giving more weight to impact over thematic discovery. The methodology used by us overcomes these issues by first extracting large amounts of information through advanced computational methods and then using unsupervised machine learning to discover the latent themes and topics in this large collection of publications. This research uses the Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases to extract corpora of 3844 texts (titles, abstracts, and keywords) from published research on SE. We decipher the key trends in the literature and segregate them into three broad categories – individual attributes and motivation, organizational actions, and institutional conditions and development, with 21 sub-topics to enhance the understanding of this field of inquiry. This study is the first in the entrepreneurship domain to use this integrated approach to review the literature, and the findings lay the groundwork for future research. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - With the fast progress in information technologies and artificial intelligence (AI), smart healthcare has gained considerable momentum. By using advanced technologies like AI, smart healthcare aims to promote human beings’ health and well-being throughout their life. As smart healthcare develops, big healthcare data are produced by various sensors, devices, and communication technologies constantly. To deal with these big multi-source data, automatic information fusion becomes crucial. Information fusion refers to the integration of multiple information sources for obtaining more reliable, effective, and precise information to support optimal decision-making. The close study of information fusion for healthcare with the adoption of advanced AI technologies has become an increasingly important and active field of research. The aim of this is to present a systematic description and state-of-the-art understanding of research about information fusion for healthcare with AI. Structural topic modeling was implemented to detect major research topics covered within 351 relevant articles. Annual trends and correlations of the identified topics were also investigated to identify potential future research directions. In addition, the primary research concerns of top countries/regions, institutions, and authors were shown and compared. The findings based on our analyses provide scientific and technological perspectives of research on information fusion for smart health with AI and offer useful insights and implications for its future development. We also provide valuable guidance for researchers and project managers to allocate research resources and promote effective international collaborations. © 2022

AB  - Electricity Supply Chain Management has become one of the foremost vital areas of research, as energy firms are extensively concerned about their supply chains in order to maximize profitability, reduce expenses, and gain market share. Thus, numerous research evaluations and implementation methodologies are observed in this area. However, only a few exceptional attempts have been undertaken in the past to summarize sporadic elements of knowledge obtained from these scientific endeavors. As a result, aiming to present a particular viewpoint of this topic, the paper utilizes three analyses—bibliometric analysis through Bibliomatrix R and VOSviewer, thematic analysis through Biblioshiny and text mining technique—topic modelling to give a summary of ESCM scientific investigation accomplished from 1975 to 2021. This study analyzes trends in publication, authorship patterns, and keyword usage. The study utilizes a probabilistic procreative model through structural topic modeling to decipher and extricate esoteric themes from ESCM-related research papers. According to this research, the most popular topics in the ESCM area are carbon emission, energy saving, risk and uncertainties, price regulations, smart grid, IoT, and game theory analysis. Other significant components include life cycle assessment, ICT system, static and dynamic transportation network equilibrium, and network modelling for evaluation and selection of suppliers. The article also identifies knowledge gaps that may guide future research. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Operational Research Society of India.

AB  - Despite increasing awareness of the need to promote diversity, equity and inclusion in regional science, it remains unclear how and to what extent underrepresentation exists in the field. In addition, although inequalities in science along these lines have been studied empirically across a wide range of fields and disciplines, they have yet to be examined specifically in the field of regional science per se. This study aims to fill this research gap by investigating the extent to which there are disparities in publication and citation rates based on race, gender and region, and how topic selection affects these differentials. To achieve this goal, we analyzed 4,930 bibliometric records for nine journals with an explicit regional science brand over the period from 1961 to 2021, we apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique regression modeling to assess how citation impact is affected by the gender, race, nationality of authors, topic selections, and other relevant factors. The results of this study provide evidence on patterns of inequality in regional science and help to understand the distribution of scientific productivity and impact by gender, race and origins. While the field is becoming more diverse and inclusive in terms publications and citations, significant gaps and disparities remains, especially regarding the Global South and minorities. We conclude with policy and programmatic recommendations for promoting broader participation in regional science in the future. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The field of climate justice has been growing in relevance since its conception in 1997. This paper presents a comprehensive bibliometric and topic modelling analyses to examine the evolution and trajectory of the climate justice literature. We analyse 1,683 publications covering the period from 1997 to 2021, highlighting foundational works, influential authors, leading nations and institutions, and prevailing research topics within this field. We employ Latent Dirichlet Allocation to uncover latent research trends in the literature providing a crucial baseline for future scholarly endeavours and policy development in the realm of climate justice. Our results show that the field of climate justice has grown exponentially from less than 5 papers annually between 1997 and 2005, to around 200 papers annually in recent years. This growth has seen a diversification of research themes with an increase in papers around the topics of health, vulnerability and adaptation, and policy and activism. There has been a consistent backdrop of publications around the topics of sustainable development and policy, and international relations and carbon emissions. Other prominent topics in the literature include education and food security, and human rights and Indigenous people. The field has moved from theoretical research to examining actual examples of climate injustices, with an increased diversification of topics. Future research could usefully focus on exploring future generations and more-than-human entities; the integration of climate justice and climate activism with broader struggles for justice; re-thinking climate adaptation “success” and “effectiveness” through the lens of climate justice, and the ramifications of the Global Goal on Adaptation on climate justice led-approaches that are inclusive, build on human rights approaches, and extend the scale of adaptation analysis beyond the local. It is imperative to prioritise addressing the climate justice needs of those most affected by climate change, transcending national borders, generational gaps, cultural differences, and even the well-being of various species. Such a holistic approach will help inform and refine global climate policy and action. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Digital technologies have been used for a vast amount of bibliometric analysis research. Although these technologies have made scientific investigation more accessible and efficient, scholars now face the daunting task of sifting through an overwhelming number of documents. This study aims to identify bibliometric research analysis's primary topics, categories, and latent topics from a global perspective. This study utilized topic modeling techniques to analyze the abstracts of 16,039 eligible papers published between 1977 and 2023 in the Scopus database. Through the use of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, the study was able to identify four distinct research topics and observe how they have evolved over time. The research topic has shifted its focus from individual concepts and words to relationships between nodes and conceptual, intellectual, and social structures. The study’s findings have significant implications for bibliometric analysis-related research, providing valuable insights into trends and patterns in bibliometric analysis content within large digital article archives. The LDA has proven to be an efficient tool for analyzing these trends and patterns quickly. This study's novel approach considers factors for word embedding usage and optimal topic numbers. It focuses on a full understanding of the LDA results and combines statistical analysis, domain knowledge, and temporal exploration to better understand how data structures work. © 2024, Ital Publication.

AB  - In the evolving landscape of entrepreneurship, digital technologies have ushered in new possibilities, attracting considerable academic attention. Despite the burgeoning research in Digital Entrepreneurship, the field remains fragmented, warranting a synthesized overview and structured research agenda. Consistently with the above, the paper presents a quantitative mapping of Digital Entrepreneurship through a bibliometric analysis of its publications. The research aims to address the need for a comprehensive, bibliometric overview of the topic, which has been echoed in recently published papers. In order to achieve this goal, we collected data from the Web of Science database, a common and scientifically sound choice in entrepreneurship research. The data were analyzed by applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation and topic modeling, thus providing a unique approach to bibliometric mapping. Topic modeling allows for the processing and analysis of significant amounts of scientific data, thus making it an ideal tool for bibliometric research. We find the field of Digital Entrepreneurship to be rather lively and in rapid development, with several publication outlets, affiliations, and countries contributing to it. We found four main topics to be extracted: the implications of Digital Entrepreneurship for innovation, Digital Entrepreneurship as an enabler for empowerment, the transformation of business models through digitalization, and the surge of digital platforms as entrepreneurial ecosystems. Additionally, we have provided a comprehensive overview of the theoretical lenses used amid the sample and a structured research agenda built upon extant gaps. From a theoretical perspective, the article serves as a starting point for future research on the topic and a comprehensive analysis of its present and past. From a practical perspective, the study is of interest to digital entrepreneurs willing to learn more about the opportunities and challenges provided by the digital landscape. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - This paper provides a systematic overview of existing literature on the interdependence between terrestrial Ecosystem Services (ES) and agricultural landscape management. To this end, we constructed a structured methodological approach that future researchers and other stakeholders may use to explore potential gaps for potential avenues for research. The framework starts with a constructed bibliometric dataset comprising 2478 paper abstracts (and associated metadata) published between 2010 and 2019 that contain references to specific ES classes and case study location references worldwide. Next, the dataset was used to construct a Structural Topic Model (STM), which features marginal effect estimation of metadata covariates on topic prevalence and topic prevalence correlation. The estimated topic graph structure is then used for community detection of interconnected topics via cluster identification, which allowed us to determine the current structure of the academic discourse on the interaction between terrestrial ES and agricultural landscape management. We expect this novel approach to enable identification of research priorities, prioritization of project portfolios for our field of interest, and reusable methodological guidelines that can be employed to target other fields of knowledge similarly. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Text mining methods can find large scale trends within research communities. For example, using stable Latent Dirichlet Allocation (a topic modeling algorithm) this study found 10 major topics in 35,391 SE research papers from 34 leading SE venues over the last 25 years (divided, evenly, between conferences and journals). Out study also shows how those topics have changed over recent years. Also, we note that (in the historical record) mono-focusing on a single topic can lead to fewer citations than otherwise. Further, while we find no overall gender bias in SE authorship, we note that women are under-represented in the top-most cited papers in our field. Lastly, we show a previously unreported dichotomy between software conferences and journals (so research topics that succeed at conferences might not succeed at journals, and vice versa). An important aspect of this work is that it is automatic and quickly repeatable (unlike prior SE bibliometric studies that used tediously slow and labor intensive methods). Automation is important since, like any data mining study, its conclusions are skewed by the data used in the analysis. The automatic methods of this paper make it far easier for other researchers to re-apply the analysis to new data, or if they want to use different modeling assumptions.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.

AB  - As a part of technology acceptance studies, customer acceptance of smart grid technology is important for its successful implementation. The worldwide implementation of smart grid technology has increased the attention of researchers in this realm. However, a thorough bibliometric analysis of customer acceptance for smart grid technology has not been carried out so far. Hence, to address this gap, the present work aims to provide the current scenario of research pertaining to the customer acceptance of smart grid technology. The bibliometric data from the year 2012 to 30 May 2021 was extracted from the Scopus database. Bibliometric analysis and network analysis were applied to obtain the research trends, contributing authors and nations working in the domain of customer acceptance of smart grid technology. In addition, topic-modelling technique was applied in the selected literature, which eventually extracted six different topics. Further, the extracted topics led us to develop a conceptual framework for customer acceptance of smart grid technology. The framework will help the practitioners, policymakers and the government to formulate long-term strategies for the successful adoption of smart grid technology.

AB  - The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries are more vulnerable to many transmissible diseases, including tuberculosis (TB). This study is to identify the scientific publications related to TB in the GCC countries using topic modeling and co-word analysis. A bibliometric analytic study. The R-package, VOSviewer software, IBM SPPS, and Scopus Analytics were used to analyze performance, hotspots, knowledge structure, thematic evolution, trend topics, and inter-gulf and international cooperation on TB in the past 30 years (1993-2022). A total of 1999 publications associated with research on GCC-TB were published. The annual growth rate of documents was 7.76%. Saudi Arabia is the most highly published, followed by the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and Bahrain. The most-cited GC country is Kingdom Saudi Arabia, followed by Kuwait. One hundred sixty research institutions contributed to the dissemination of TB-related knowledge in the GCC, where the highest publishing organizations were King Saud University (Kingdom Saudi Arabia; n = 518). The number of publications related to TB is high in GCC Countries. The current tendencies indicated that GCC scholars are increasingly focused on deep learning, chest X-ray, molecular docking, comorbid covid-19, risk factors, and Mycobacterium bovis.

AB  - This paper identifies trends in the application of big data in the transport sector and categorizes research work across scientific subfields. The systematic analysis considered literature published between 2012 and 2022. A total of 2671 studies were evaluated from a dataset of 3532 collected papers, and bibliometric techniques were applied to capture the evolution of research interest over the years and identify the most influential studies. The proposed unsupervised classification model defined categories and classified the relevant articles based on their particular scientific interest using representative keywords from the title, abstract, and keywords (referred to as top words). The model’s performance was verified with an accuracy of 91% using Naïve Bayesian and Convolutional Neural Networks approach. The analysis identified eight research topics, with urban transport planning and smart city applications being the dominant categories. This paper contributes to the literature by proposing a methodology for literature analysis, identifying emerging scientific areas, and highlighting potential directions for future research. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The concept of resilience has been applied in several fields of academic research and has also grown in popularity among economists. The main contribution of this article is the systematic analysis and interpretation of the existing large body of resilience literature in economics by using topic modeling, a modern machine-learning research method. The advantage of this method is that it offers a more in-depth understanding of the themes in the resilience literature as opposed to the terminological classifications typically used in bibliometric studies. The results show that the identified topics are spread widely across different subareas of economics and deal with diverse themes, such as adaptation to climate change, stability of the financial system, and various types of shocks in regional economies. The findings reveal that the literature can be divided into two domains: one that deal with incremental changes occurring over a long period of time and the other dealing with unexpected, transient, and sudden changes. Furthermore, according to the results, well-known, highly cited research papers combine knowledge from different fields. Policymakers seeking to support cutting-edge research projects may benefit from this finding, as it emphasizes the need for policy measures to enhance cross-fertilized research. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - As deep underground digital twins have not yet been established worldwide, this study extracted keywords from national or city-led digital twin practices and elements of digital twins and through these keywords selected research papers and topics that could contribute to the establishment of deep underground digital twins in the future. We applied the concept of digital twins in geology and underground research to collect 1702 papers from the Web of Science and conducted semantic network analysis and topic modeling. The keywords digital, three dimensions, and real time were placed in the middle and have many links in the word network. Artificial intelligence, deep learning, and neural networks all showed a low degree of centrality. As a result of topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), topics related to topography, geological structure, and rock distribution, which are the basic data for building a deep underground digital twin, were noted, and topics related to earthquakes/vibrations, landslides, groundwater, and volcanoes were identified. Energy resources and space utilization have emerged as the main themes. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Blockchain and immersive technology are the pioneers in bringing digitalization to tourism, and researchers worldwide are exploring many facets of these techniques. This paper analyzes the various aspects of blockchain technology and its potential use in tourism. We explore high-frequency keywords, perform network analysis of relevant publications to analyze patterns, and introduce machine learning techniques to facilitate systematic reviews. We focused on 94 publications from Web Science that dealt with blockchain implementation in tourism from 2017 to 2022. We used Vosviewer for network analysis and artificial intelligence models with the help of machine learning tools to predict the relevance of the work. Many reviewed articles mainly deal with blockchain in tourism and related terms such as smart tourism and crypto tourism. This study is the first attempt to use text analysis to improve the topic modeling of blockchain in tourism. It comprehensively analyzes the technology’s potential use in the hospitality, accommodation, and booking industry. In this context, the paper provides significant value to researchers by giving an insight into the trends and keyword patterns. Tourism still has many unexplored areas; journal articles should also feature special studies on this topic. © 2023 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Introduction: The purpose of this study was to assess the landscape of thyroid nodules research during the last 22 years using machine learning and text analysis. Methods: In November 2021, we obtained from PubMed all works indexed under the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) subject line “thyroid nodules.” The entire set of search results was retrieved in XML format, and metadata such as title, abstract, keywords, MeSH words, and year of publication were extracted for bibliometric evaluation from the original XML files. To increase the specificity of the investigation, the Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling method was applied. Results: Our study included 5,770 research papers. By using frequency analysis of MeSH terms, research on thyroid nodules was divided into two categories: clinical and basic. The proportion of clinical research is nearing 89% and is dominated by the differential diagnosis of thyroid nodules. In contrast, the proportion of MeSH terms relating to basic research was just 11%, with DNA mutation analysis being the most common topic. Following this, LDA analysis revealed the thyroid nodule study had three clusters: Imaging Studies, Biopsy and Diagnosis, and Epidemiology and Screening of Thyroid Cancer. The result suggests that current thyroid nodule research appears to have focused on ultrasonography and histological diagnosis, which are tightly correlated. Molecular biomarker research has increased, therefore enhancing the diagnostic precision of thyroid nodules. However, inflammation, anxiety, and mental health disorders related to thyroid nodules have received little attention. Conclusion: Basic research on thyroid nodules has unmet research requirements. Future research could focus on developing strategies to more efficiently identify malignant nodules, exploring the mechanism of thyroid nodule development, and enhancing the quality of life of thyroid patients.

AB  - As the volume and diversity of COVID-19 manuscripts grow, trend topic detection has become a more crucial issue to utilize information from pandemic-specific literature. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and bibliometric analysis are common ways of detecting trend topics. In this study, a hybrid approach is suggested by combining both techniques as a novelty perspective to attain comprehensive information. The topics studied in the COVID-19 literature were outlined with the LDA analysis, and then the COVID-19 studies were examined specifically in the field of information systems (IS) with bibliometric analysis. As an outcome of LDA analysis, it has been determined that the topics studied on COVID-19 are concentrated under the categories of clinical studies, epidemiology and transmission of COVID-19, national and global policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impacts of the COVID-19. Infodemiology in social media, computer-aided detection methods for diagnosis, information systems for contact tracing and health systems, distance learning solutions, data analytics for modeling and forecasting COVID-19, epidemiology, molecular docking of COVID-19 are primary topics of IS literature in COVID-19 era. This paper assists researchers in providing a comprehensive view of the compatibility of COVID-19 literature at a macro level and in the scope of IS and also offers suggestions for future work by IS researchers. © 2023, International Journal of Information Science and Management.

AB  - Discovering promising research themes in a scientific domain by evaluating semantic information extracted from bibliometric databases represents a challenging task for Natural Language Processing (NLP). While existing NLP methods generally characterize the research topics using unique key terms, we take a step further by more accurately modeling the research themes as finite sets of key terms. The proposed approach involves two stages: identifying the research themes from paper metadata using LDA topic modeling; and, evaluation of research theme trends by employing a version of the Mann-Kendall test that is able to cope with multivariate time series of term occurrences. The results obtained by applying this general methodology to Information Security domain confirm its viability.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This paper incorporates scholarly articles, conference papers, and published books, analyzing these sources to explore how topic modeling is used to uncover trends, identify research areas, and contribute to understanding the digital economy. The study utilizes bibliography data and Python libraries for topic modeling to examine 8,321 documents from the Scopus database. Through rigorous analysis, three distinct topics were identified, and their development trends were traced, providing insights into the shifting focus within the field. The study also validates the classification proposed by the coherence coefficient and contributes theoretically and methodologically by employing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling technology within text analytics. The results of this study indicated that "Digital Transformation" emerged as the most popular, accounting for 56.6% of tokens. However, the "Digitalization" topic exhibited relatively lower popularity, representing only 21.2% of tokens. The findings help enhance the understanding of global research trends and offer a valuable framework for comprehending digital economy research. Furthermore, the study emphasizes the significance of analyzing digitalization, data governance, and digital transformation, highlighting the efficacy of LDA as a powerful tool for efficient and accurate text analytics. The research findings are especially pertinent for scholars in information science, data mining, econometrics, and bibliometrics. They offer a foundational understanding of topic modeling, facilitating further investigation and exploration in these fields. However, the study identifies two limitations, including the limited dataset extracted solely from Scopus and the restriction to abstracts rather than full texts. Future research should consider expanding data sources and incorporating full texts from authoritative articles in multiple languages to attain more comprehensive outcomes. ©Author (s) 2024 Distributed under Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0.

AB  - Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have driven extensive research into developing diverse multimodal data analysis approaches for smart healthcare. There is a scarcity of large-scale analysis of literature in this field based on quantitative approaches. This study performed a bibliometric and topic modeling examination on 683 articles from 2002 to 2022, focusing on research topics and trends, journals, countries/regions, institutions, authors, and scientific collaborations. Results showed that, firstly, the number of articles has grown from 1 in 2002 to 220 in 2022, with a majority being published in interdisciplinary journals that link healthcare and medical research and information technology and AI. Secondly, the significant rise in the quantity of research articles can be attributed to the increasing contribution of scholars from non-English speaking countries/regions and the noteworthy contributions made by authors in the USA and India. Thirdly, researchers show a high interest in diverse research issues, especially, cross-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for brain tumor analysis, cancer prognosis through multi-dimensional data analysis, and AI-assisted diagnostics and personalization in healthcare, with each topic experiencing a significant increase in research interest. There is an emerging trend towards issues such as applying generative adversarial networks and contrastive learning for multimodal medical image fusion and synthesis and utilizing the combined spatiotemporal resolution of functional MRI and electroencephalogram in a data-centric manner. This study is valuable in enhancing researchers’ and practitioners’ understanding of the present focal points and upcoming trajectories in AI-powered smart healthcare based on multimodal data analysis. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The bibliometrics research on nanotechnology highlights close interrelationships between scientific and technological activities (S&T) in the field of nanotechnology. Notwithstanding abundant empirical evidence on the mutual relations between S&T, the dynamics of the relationship from a contextual perspective have gained relatively little attention. Accordingly, our understanding of how science- and technology-oriented nanotechnology identifies development opportunities from each other is still at a nascent stage. To address this gap, by focusing on nanotechnology in the semiconductor industry, we use structural topic model to empirically explore the dynamic interrelationships between science- and technology-oriented nanotechnology. We empirically delineate the dynamic development trends in the context of the interrelationships between S&T and demonstrate how development opportunities are identified from each other. These findings show a new window of opportunities for how state-of-the-art models for semantic analysis can be used in the literature on S&T interrelationships. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objectives: This study aims to demonstrate the capacity of natural language processing and topic modeling to manage and interpret the vast quantities of scholarly publications in the landscape of stroke research. These tools can expedite the literature review process, reveal hidden themes, and track rising research areas. Materials and methods: Our study involved reviewing and analyzing articles published in five prestigious stroke journals, namely Stroke, International Journal of Stroke, European Stroke Journal, Translational Stroke Research, and Journal of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Diseases. The team extracted document titles, abstracts, publication years, and citation counts from the Scopus database. BERTopic was chosen as the topic modeling technique. Using linear regression models, current stroke research trends were identified. Python 3.1 was used to analyze and visualize data. Results: Out of the 35,779 documents collected, 26,732 were classified into 30 categories and used for analysis. "Animal Models," "Rehabilitation," and "Reperfusion Therapy" were identified as the three most prevalent topics. Linear regression models identified "Emboli," "Medullary and Cerebellar Infarcts," and "Glucose Metabolism" as trending topics, whereas "Cerebral Venous Thrombosis," "Statins," and "Intracerebral Hemorrhage" demonstrated a weaker trend. Conclusions: The methodology can assist researchers, funders, and publishers by documenting the evolution and specialization of topics. The findings illustrate the significance of animal models, the expansion of rehabilitation research, and the centrality of reperfusion therapy. Limitations include a five-journal cap and a reliance on high-quality metadata. © 2024

AB  - The financial sector, by mobilizing capital, is fundamental to adapt and mitigate the impact of climate change in the economy. This has led to the emergence of a new research field, climate finance, where experts are starting to harness Machine Learning (ML) as a tool to solve new problems, due to the need to use big datasets and to model complex non-linear relationships. We propose a review of the academic literature that goes beyond the existing bibliometric studies in the field, with the aim of identifying relevant application domains of this technology to inform ML experts where and how their modeling expertise may add value in climate finance. To achieve this, we first assemble a corpus of texts from three scientific databases and use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling, to uncover seven research areas which we label as: natural hazards, biodiversity, agricultural risk, carbon markets, energy economics, Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors & investing, and climate data. Second, we perform an analysis of publication trends, which confirms that ML is growing both in breadth and depth in climate finance, in particular topics related to energy economics, ESG factors and climate data. Interestingly, some methods stand out in each area, based on data characteristics and modeling requirements. © 2024 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The prevention of crime is a multifaceted challenge with legal, political, and cultural implications. Surveillance technologies play a crucial role in assisting law enforcement and other relevant parties in this mission. Drones, cameras, and wiretaps are examples of such devices. As their use increases, it becomes essential to address related challenges involving various stakeholders and consider cultural, political, and legal aspects. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of surveillance technologies and identify commonalities and differences in perspectives among social media users and researchers. Data extraction was performed from two platforms: Scopus (for academic research papers) and platform X (formerly known as Twitter). The dataset included 88,989 tweets and 4,874 research papers. Topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning approach, was applied to analyze the content. The research results revealed that privacy received little attention across the datasets, indicating its relatively low prominence. The military applications and their usage have been documented in academic research articles as well as tweets. Based on the empirical evidence, it seems that contemporary surveillance technology may be accurately described as possessing a bi-directional nature, including both sousveillance and surveillance, which aligns with Deleuzian ideas on the Panopticon. The study’s findings also indicate that there was a greater level of interest in actual applications of surveillance technologies as opposed to more abstract concepts like ethics and privacy.

AB  - Background: In the last five years, there has been an accelerated growth in the scientific production about Artificial Intelligence and Healthcare by Scholars of the most diverse disciplines. Recently, the scientific corpus has been enriched with considerable literature reviews ranging from the overview of large collections of scientific documents to the recognition of the state of knowledge on specific aspects (e.g., in the medical field, ophthalmology, cardiology, nephrology, etc.). Methods: The methodological approaches belong to the scientific fields of bibliometrics and topic modeling. Following a bibliometric analysis of the literature on the subject, conducted on a vast collection of scientific contributions, we also searched for the "latent" themes in the semantic structures of these documents, identified the relationships between them and recognized the most likely to be investigated in the future. Results: Results show 24 topics about future trends in literature review connecting the field of AI and Healthcare. Conclusions: This bibliometric review of the literature on artificial intelligence and healthcare allows identifying of some privileged areas of attention by scholars of different disciplines. However, it also reveals the limits of hard clustering techniques, as demonstrated by the presence of some keywords in several groups. The numerous existing reviews must be integrated by reviews based on Topic Modeling techniques, which make it possible to identify topics, historical trends (classical and emerging topics), associations between the documents and to predict, on a probabilistic basis, which scientific fields will be most likely to see development in the future. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Objective To analyze the current research status of uveitis in China. Methods It was a bibliometric analysis study. Using search formulas covering uveitis and its multiple subtypes, uveitis‑related literature in English with publication dates from 2013 to 2022 was retrieved in Web of Science core databases through certain search strategies. This study used the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithm to build topic models and analyzed the trends of research topics in recent years. Bibliometric analysis was used to analyze and visualize the bibliometric indicators (e.g., number of publications, citations, and H‑index) of the included literature using tools such as VOSviewer software. Results Over the past decade, China has published 1 657 papers on uveitis, ranking second globally. However, there is still room for improvement in terms of the H‑index (58) and citation (12.28 per publication). Countries such as the USA (43.04%) and the United Kingdom (62.54%) were engaged in more international collaboration. We identified ten optimal LDA topics for uveitis literature in China such as immunotherapy, Behçet′s disease, and Vogt‑Koyanagi‑Harada syndrome. Research on uveitis in China was mostly published in Ocular Immunology and Inflammation (92). Conclusions China has made remarkable progress in uveitis research. Nonetheless, there is still untapped potential to enhance our global academic influence. It is encouraged to promote international collaborations, harness our expertise in areas like Behçet′s disease and VKH syndrome, and publish our scientific achievements in high‑impact journals. © 2024 Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co.Ltd.

AB  - Background: With the exponential growth of publications in the field of investigator-initiated research/trials (IIRs/IITs), it has become necessary to employ text mining and bibliometric analysis as tools for gaining deeper insights into this area of study. By using these methods, researchers can effectively identify and analyze research topics within the field. Methods: This study retrieved relevant publications from the Web of Science Core Collection and conducted bioinformatics analysis. The latent Dirichlet allocation model, which is based on machine learning, was utilized to identify subfield research topics. Results: A total of 4315 articles related to IIRs/IITs were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection. After excluding duplicates and articles with missing abstracts, a final dataset of 3333 articles was included for bibliometric analysis. The number of publications showed a steady increase over time, particularly since 2000. The United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada, Denmark, Japan, Switzerland, and France emerged as the most productive countries in terms of IIRs/IITs. The citation analysis revealed intriguing trends, with certain highly cited articles showing a significant increase in citation frequency in recent years. A model with 45 topics was deemed the best fit for characterizing the extensively researched fields within IIRs/IITs. Our analysis revealed 10 top topics that have garnered significant attention, spanning domains such as community health, cancer treatment, brain development and disease mechanisms, nursing research, and stem cell therapy. These top topics offer researchers valuable directions for further investigation and innovation. Additionally, we identified 12 hot topics, which represent the most cutting-edge and highly regarded research areas within the field. Conclusion: This study contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the current research landscape and provides valuable insights for researchers working in this domain. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - The research interest of knowledge in human resource management (HRM) is significant. Bibliometric or systematic literature review studies capture the main areas and trends in the field of HRM. However, many HRM studies work only with a limited number of analyzed documents (systematic literature review) or go more in breadth than in depth of researched topics (bibliometric reviews). This smart literature review study is based on processing metadata to get results from 7,318 documents related to human resource management and knowledge, published between 1960 and 2021, retrieved from the Scopus database with research directions linked to knowledge and human resources and the current topic Covid-19 pandemic. Such a broad study has not yet been published in the field of knowledge and HRM. The study answers three research questions related to trends and innovative journeys in knowledge-based HRM. Descriptive and inferential statistics was used to capture basic trends in knowledge and HRM themes. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used for topic modelling with Gibbs sampling, which we use on a corpus of abstracts. Used method allowed us to identify latent topics which describe a more in-depth relationship between HRM and knowledge. We identified 13 topics related to HRM and knowledge research as the most relevant and showed directions and trends among the authors of HRM and knowledge management. The last part is devoted to the current topic of Covid-19, key areas identified in the literature and their impact on knowledge management from the perspective of HRM. During the analyzed period, the highest increase of research interest and research impact was recorded by two topics - Employee performance and Risk management. Our study maps the development of these and other topics and more deeply characterizes research in knowledge-based HRM during the pandemic. The results thus offer an up-to-date scientific map of this rapidly developing field and can be the basis for a broader discussion on the future direction of HRM. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose: The emergence of machine learning has opened a new way for researchers. It allows them to supplement the traditional manual methods for conducting a literature review and turning it into smart literature. This study aims to present a framework for incorporating machine learning into financial statement fraud (FSF) literature analysis. This framework facilitates the analysis of a large amount of literature to show the trend of the field and identify the most productive authors, journals and potential areas for future research. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a framework was introduced that merges bibliometric analysis techniques such as word frequency, co-word analysis and coauthorship analysis with the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling approach. This framework was used to uncover subtopics from 20 years of financial fraud research articles. Furthermore, the hierarchical clustering method was used on selected subtopics to demonstrate the primary contexts in the literature on FSF. Findings: This study has contributed to the literature in two ways. First, this study has determined the top journals, articles, countries and keywords based on various bibliometric metrics. Second, using topic modeling and then hierarchy clustering, this study demonstrates the four primary contexts in FSF detection. Research limitations/implications: In this study, the authors tried to comprehensively view the studies related to financial fraud conducted over two decades. However, this research has limitations that can be an opportunity for future researchers. The first limitation is due to language bias. This study has focused on English language articles, so it is suggested that other researchers consider other languages as well. The second limitation is caused by citation bias. In this study, the authors tried to show the top articles based on the citation criteria. However, judging based on citation alone can be misleading. Therefore, this study suggests that the researchers consider other measures to check the citation quality and assess the studies’ precision by applying meta-analysis. Originality/value: Despite the popularity of bibliometric analysis and topic modeling, there have been limited efforts to use machine learning for literature review. This novel approach of using hierarchical clustering on topic modeling results enable us to uncover four primary contexts. Furthermore, this method allowed us to show the keywords of each context and highlight significant articles within each context. © 2023, Milad Soltani, Alexios Kythreotis and Arash Roshanpoor.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising field in cardiovascular disease (CVD) research, offering innovative approaches to enhance diagnosis, treatment, and patient outcomes. In this study, we conducted bibliometric analysis combined with topic modeling to provide a comprehensive overview of the AI research landscape in CVD. Our analysis included 23,846 studies from Web of Science and PubMed, capturing the latest advancements and trends in this rapidly evolving field. By employing LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) we identified key research themes, trends, and collaborations within the AI-CVD domain. The findings revealed the exponential growth of AI-related research in CVD, underscoring its immense potential to revolutionize cardiovascular healthcare. The annual scientific publication of machine learning papers in CVD increases continuously and significantly since 2016, with an overall annual growth rate of 22.8%. Almost half (46.2%) of the growth happened in the last 5 years. USA, China, India, UK and Korea were the top five productive countries in number of publications. UK, Germany and Australia were the most collaborative countries with a multiple country publication (MCP) value of 42.8%, 40.3% and 40.0% respectively. We observed the emergence of twenty-two distinct research topics, including “stroke and robotic rehabilitation therapy,” “robotic-assisted cardiac surgery,” and “cardiac image analysis,” which persisted as major topics throughout the years. Other topics, such as “retinal image analysis and CVD” and “biomarker and wearable signal analyses,” have recently emerged as dominant areas of research in cardiovascular medicine. Convolutional neural network appears to be the most mentioned algorithm followed by LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours). This indicates that the future direction of AI cardiovascular research is predominantly directing toward neural networks and image analysis. As AI continues to shape the landscape of CVD research, our study serves as a comprehensive guide for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, providing valuable insights into the current state of AI in CVD research. This study offers a deep understanding of research trends and paves the way for future directions to maximiz the potential of AI to effectively combat cardiovascular diseases. 2024 Shiferaw, Wali, Waltemath and Zeleke.

AB  - This study offers a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 research in education. A multi-methods approach was used to capture the full breadth of educational research. As such, a bibliometric analysis, structural topic modeling, and qualitative synthesis of top papers were combined. A total of 4,201 articles were retrieved from Scopus, mostly published from 2019 to 2021. In this work special attention is paid to analyzing and synthesizing findings about: (i) status of research about COVID-19 regarding frequencies, venues, publishing countries, (ii) identification of main topics in the COVID-19 research, and (iii) identification of the major themes in most cited articles and their impact on the educational community. Structural topic modeling identified three main groups of topics that related to education in general, moving to online education, or diverse topics (e.g., perceptions, inclusion, medical education, engagement and motivation, well-being, and equality). A deeper analysis of the papers that received most attention revealed that problem understanding was the dominating theme of papers, followed by challenges, impact, guidance, online migration, and tools and resources. A vast number of papers were produced. However, thoughtful, well-planned, and meaningful research was hard to conceptualize or implement, and a sense of urgency led to a deluge of research with thin contributions in a time of dire need to genuine insights. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - In recent years, supply chain research has grown at a tremendous pace. Many review papers use systematic literature reviews to describe longer-term trends and perspectives. However, many of these studies analyze a limited number of documents, which does not always guarantee representativeness of results. This paper presents a smart bibliometric literature review of supply chain research. The objectives are: (i) to identify supply chain research interest and research impact across subject areas; (ii) to capture trends of supply chain research in the last four decades; (iii) to identify research domains related to supply chain and development of these research domains over time; (iv) to explore the impact of COVID-19 on areas of supply chain research. Authors process 116,759 documents related to supply chain research, published between 1969 and 2021, retrieved from the Scopus database. After providing statistics regarding research interest and research impact, they use a corpus of abstracts to perform topic modeling. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with Gibbs sampling, 13 research domains related to supply chain research are identified: Ecology; Food supply chain; IT support of supply chain; Retail-oriented supply chain; Risk and disruptive aspects of supply chain; Performance management; Value management and social aspect; Production; Sustainability & development; Models & optimization; Effective inventory management; Supply chain management systems; Supplier and logistic analytics. We also present the individual areas of supply chain research during COVID-19 pandemic. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article aims to shed light on the infodemic of disinformation, misinformation, and malinformation in the digital era of a new normal where deepfake and fake news are omnipresent. To do so, this article establishes a general theory of information and engages in big data analytics involving a scientometrics (bibliometrics) analysis with topic modeling of the major trends in the field. In doing so, this article reveals three noteworthy findings. First, infodemic is multifaceted in terms of its content, platform, manifestation, and solution. Second, infodemic research delivers the richest insights on misinformation, followed by fake news, disinformation, infodemic solutions, and malinformation. Third, interest in the dissemination of false information is greater than its creation, with the task of ascertaining the intrinsic elements (e.g. maliciousness in disinformation and malinformation) being more challenging than that of extrinsic elements (e.g. truth of misinformation). The article concludes with implications for theory and practice as well as directions for future research. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Previous reviews of cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) have not provided an integrative and evolutionary analysis, and the academic literature generally reflects a fragmented research perspective. Therefore, this study combined a bibliometric analysis and text mining to analyze the evolution of theories and topics as well as theory-Topic co-occurrence. We also used a topic modeling technique to divide the articles into ten subareas and further analyzed their subthemes and dynamics. Overall, we examined 1197 articles published from 1989 to 2022. This study contributes to the current literature by providing data on theory-Topic co-occurrence and its evolution in cross-border M&As, conducting theory-Topic co-occurrence analysis that identifies popular research trends and provides new insights into how to integrate M&As practices with theories, identifying ten subareas via bibliometric analysis and BERTopic modeling, and identifying key theories and emerging themes to be examined in future studies.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose: The research on social media-based academic communication has made great progress with the development of the mobile Internet era, and while a large number of research results have emerged, clarifying the topology of the knowledge label network (KLN) in this field and showing the development of its knowledge labels and related concepts is one of the issues that must be faced. This study aims to discuss the aforementioned issue. Design/methodology/approach: From a bibliometric perspective, 5,217 research papers in this field from CNKI from 2011 to 2021 are selected, and the title and abstract of each paper are subjected to subword processing and topic model analysis, and the extended labels are obtained by taking the merged set with the original keywords, so as to construct a conceptually expanded KLN. At the same time, appropriate time window slicing is performed to observe the temporal evolution of the network topology. Specifically, the basic network topological parameters and the complex modal structure are analyzed empirically to explore the evolution pattern and inner mechanism of the KLN in this domain. In addition, the ARIMA time series prediction model is used to further predict and compare the changing trend of network structure among different disciplines, so as to compare the differences among different disciplines. Findings: The results show that the degree sequence distribution of the KLN is power-law distributed during the growth process, and it performs better in the mature stage of network development, and the network shows more stable scale-free characteristics. At the same time, the network has the characteristics of “short path and high clustering” throughout the time series, which is a typical small-world network. The KLN consists of a small number of hub nodes occupying the core position of the network, while a large number of label nodes are distributed at the periphery of the network and formed around these hub nodes, and its knowledge expansion pattern has a certain retrospective nature. More knowledge label nodes expand from the center to the periphery and have a gradual and stable trend. In addition, there are certain differences between different disciplines, and the research direction or topic of library and information science (LIS) is more refined and deeper than that of journalism and media and computer science. The LIS discipline has shown better development momentum in this field. Originality/value: KLN is constructed by using extended labels and empirically analyzed by using network frontier conceptual motifs, which reflects the innovation of the study to a certain extent. In future research, the influence of larger-scale network motifs on the structural features and evolutionary mechanisms of KLNs will be further explored. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In stock markets, technical analysis plays a vital role by offering valuable insights into price trends, patterns, and anticipated market movements, aiding investors in making well-informed decisions. This study employs bibliometric and topic modelling approaches on 589 English-language journal articles indexed in Scopus in the last two decades (from 2003 to 2023), exclusively focusing on technical analysis in stock markets. The keyword co-occurrence analysis identifies five topic clusters. The application of structural topic modelling also unravels five prominent thematic clusters, namely pattern-based forecasting, rule-based trading, algorithmic trading, techno-fundamental trading, and machine learning & sentiment analysis. The topic of pattern-based forecasting involves researching the application of various patterns or models to predict stock prices. Rule-based trading concentrates on utilizing technical analysis tools to generate buy and sell signals, aiming for profitability. The algorithmic trading cluster explores the use of algorithms to systematically execute buy and sell actions, especially in high-frequency trading scenarios. Techno-fundamental trading investigates the integration of both fundamental and technical analysis in trading and investment decisions. Lastly, machine learning & sentiment analysis focus on applying advanced machine learning techniques and sentiment analysis for predicting stock prices, highlighting the use of sophisticated methods in this domain. The three predominant topics in the dataset are “rule-based trading,” “machine learning & sentiment analysis,” and “algorithmic trading” constituting 26.79%, 23.52%, and 21.11% of the dataset, respectively. These findings underscore the prominence and significance of these themes within the context of the research domain. © Sarveshwar Kumar Inani, Harsh Pradhan, Surender Kumar, Baidyanath Biswas, 2024.

AB  - The pandemic and a series of subsequent disruptive events fully exposed the vulnerability of supply chains. Research in the field of resilience in supply chain risk management has recorded significant interest across a wide range of academic disciplines. Therefore, there is a need to synthesize, categorize and explain existing and newly emerging research directions, which may represent relevant platforms for developing supply chain concepts in the future. This study addresses this need by providing a bibliometric review of published papers on resilience in supply chain risk management. By analyzing more than 2500 published papers through bibliometric and machine-learning-based methods, we identified ten topics related to risk and resilience of supply chains: Pandemic impacts of food supply chain; Practices for capability and performance; Supplier-related modeling and optimization; System security and critical infrastructure; Production changes; IT in manufacturing process; Sustainability in global economy; Management and business approach; Modeling and design of complex networks; Operational strategies for risk mitigation. By analyzing articles published since 2020, we also identified a change in the direction of research dedicated to supply chain risk and resilience; we identified three other topics that were not recognized as distinct topics prior to 2020—Operational management; strategy; Sustainable production. The results of this study help in understanding the change in the direction of research in the area of risk and resilience of supply chains and thus provide up-to-date information for further research in this dynamically developing area. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - [Purpose/Significance] The introduction of national poverty alleviation policies and rural revitalization strategies has thrust the issue of education for left-behind children into the spotlight of scholarly attention. Education, far beyond serving as a mere instrument for personal growth and human capital accumulation for left-behind children, emerges as a pivotal measure in consolidating rural poverty alleviation endeavors and breaking the transmission of intergenerational poverty in China. It stands as a vital force propelling the future of rural revitalization. Yet, the existing literature on the education of left-behind children remains sporadic and dispersed. A more profound organizational effort, integrating, synthesizing, and evaluating this scattered literature, is imperative to establish a foundational framework for future research, fostering more cohesive and focused research endeavors. Presently, literature review studies primarily fall into three categories: qualitative review methods, meta-analysis, and bibliometric analysis methods employing tools like Citespace. This study sets out to achieve a systematic and comprehensive understanding of education-related issues for rural left-behind children through text mining methods grounded in topic models. [Method/Process] The advent of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies has empowered the processing and analysis of vast amounts of textual data. Previous research, employing latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic models, successfully mined texts related to teacher team construction reform policies, internationalization in higher education literature, news reports, and online comments. In this study, a corpus was meticulously constructed using abstract texts extracted from 2037 journal articles published between 2002 and 2023. The structural topic model (STM) was chosen for topic modeling, overcoming the limitations associated with LDA, with a specific emphasis on exploring the diversity and dynamism of topics within the existing literature. [Results/Conclusions] The culmination of this research effort identified eight distinct research themes: psychological well-being, factors leading to left-behind children, macro-level coping strategies, types of guardianship, review studies, family education, media literacy, and micro-level coping strategies. By synergizing document metadata information, the study systematically unraveled the evolving trends of these topics over time, providing crucial insights into potential shifts in the focus of left-behind children's education research. It is essential to note that this study, while collecting abstracts instead of full texts, may not capture the entirety of information contained in complete research articles. Future research endeavors should explore left-behind children's education more comprehensively, leveraging full-text mining techniques for a more nuanced understanding of this critical subject. © 2024 Chinese Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology/Zhonghua Fu Chan Ke Za Zhi.

AB  - The study utilized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) Topic modeling to identify prevalent latent topics within Open Access (OA) Library and Information Science (LIS) journals from 2013 to 2022. Eight core OA Scopus indexed journals were selected based on their SJR scores and DOAJ listing. Titles, Abstracts and keywords of 2589 articles were extracted from the Scopus database. R software packages were used to perform data analysis and LDA topic modeling. The optimal value of k was determined to be 9. The analysis revealed that 53.89% of documents comprise over 50% of a certain topic (θ > 0.50). Notably, ‘Scholarly Communication’ and ‘Information Systems, Models and Frameworks’ emerged as dominant topics with the highest proportions of research literature in the corpus. The topic ‘Scholarly Communication’ experienced significant growth with an average annual growth rate (AAGR) of 4.37%, while ‘Collection development and E-resources’ exhibited the lowest research proportion and a negative AAGR of − 4.22%. Additionally, topics such as ‘Information Seeking Behaviour and User Studies’, ‘User Education and Information Literacy’, and ‘Information Retrieval and Systematic Review’ remained stable and persistent topics. Conversely, research on traditional topics like ‘Librarianship and Profession’, ‘Bibliometrics’ and ‘Medical Library and Health Information’ showed a gradual decline. The LDA topic modeling approach unveiled previously unknown or unexplored topics in open access LIS research literature, enhancing our understanding of emerging trends. © Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary 2024.

AB  - Sustainability has gained prominence as a discipline for academics and professional practitioners. This article presents a bibliographic account and related analysis of research in sustainability between 1990 and 2019. A critical study of different aspects of sustainability requires a multi/interdisciplinary systems approach. Such a study may encompass ecological, economical, and sociological perspectives. For this reason, the bibliometric analysis has covered a wide range of professional disciplines. 183,779 bibliographic entries from SCOPUS were analysed with latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to discover different aspects of publications in sustainability. The study showed that all publications can be classified according to 25 topics, showing how sustainability research has evolved and the consequent gaps that need to be filled for the advancement of the research and community of practice. The LDA analysis resulted in creating a topic model that facilitates the automated categorisation of publications regarding sustainability. © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.. All rights reserved.

AB  - The outbreak of Covid-19 created disruptions in manufacturing operations. One of the most serious negative impacts is the shortage of critical medical supplies. Manufacturing firms faced pressure from governments to use their manufacturing capacity to repurpose their production for meeting the critical demand for necessary products. For this purpose, recent advancements in technology and artificial intelligence (AI) could act as response solutions to conquer the threats linked with repurposing manufacturing (RM). The study’s purpose is to investigate the significance of AI in RM through a systematic literature review (SLR). This study gathered around 453 articles from the SCOPUS database in the selected research field. Structural Topic Modelling (STM) was utilised to generate emerging research themes from the selected documents on AI in RM. In addition, to study the research trends in the field of AI in RM, a bibliometric analysis was undertaken using the R-package. The findings of the study showed that there is a vast scope for research in this area as the yearly global production of articles in this field is limited. However, it is an evolving field and many research collaborations were identified. The study proposes a comprehensive research framework and propositions for future research development. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The interest of the academic and practitioner communities on the topic of Digital Twin has grown substantially in recent years. Bibliometric analysis can serve as a useful tool to explore the roadmap of the Digital Twin across various emergent themes over time. In this paper, we compare and analyze 1270 news articles and 4036 research publications to assess the evolution of the Digital Twin paradigm according to these sources from 2016 to 2021. We apply topic modeling and sentiment analysis on the textual corpora. Our analysis shows that certain topics related to applications, simulation, and enabling technologies for Digital Twin find greater coverage and generate higher positivity over time. We ascertain the coevolution and divergence in the number and sentiment of topics through curve matching metrics and determine whether they can rouse consumer interest, captured through online search trends. Our regression analysis shows that news on applications of Digital Twin and research on process evaluation through real-time simulation significantly impact the search frequency of consumers. Our research helps the digital product and service providers to understand the academia-industry gap in their effort to investigate Digital Twin and guides them on steps to take and themes to pursue for generating consumer interest. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques are decision support systems that provide systematic approaches to solve hospitality and tourism (H&T) problems while minimizing the risk of failure. However, less is known about the application of MCDM techniques in H&T research. This study aims to systematically assess the use of MCDM techniques in H&T research to classify its current application and determine its application potential for H&T research. Design/methodology/approach: This study used bibliometric analysis to examine all published MCDM studies focused on H&T industries, since 1997. In addition, topic modelling was used to discover key concepts. Finally, top cited studies in terms of total citations per year and total citations were qualitatively reviewed for more insights. Findings: The findings revealed an ongoing interest in applying MCDM techniques in H&T research. Specifically, the extension of fuzzy theory in MCDM techniques is burgeoning among H&T researchers. However, a certain number of MCDM techniques seem to be ignored in this field with a repetitive application of MCDM techniques in particular areas. Research limitations/implications: The data for the current research was solely retrieved from Scopus and other databases were not included. Therefore, future research is called for to re-examine the study by considering data from various databases. Originality/value: This study contributes to extant H&T literature by identifying the most prolific and influential countries, journals, publications and trends by applying MCDM techniques in H&T research, and elucidating the implications and characteristics of MCDM techniques in H&T research. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Due to the importance of maternal health for the development of society and the role of information systems in improving healthcare, this study aims to investigate and analyze the characteristics and topics of articles published in the field of information systems in maternal health. The articles were retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) on October 23, 2021. The bibliometric indicators included the number of documents and citations, top journals, institutes, and countries. The co-authorship collaboration network of the countries was examined using Bibliometrix 3.1 package and VOSviewer software (ver. 1.6.17). In addition to bibliometric analysis, the related topic modelling was calculated with Non-Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm in Python programming language. Overall, 1140 original articles were published in the selected field in the WoS database within the years 1991-2021. The results demonstrated an ascending growth in the number of publications. The "The University of London", the "London School of Hygiene Tropical Medicine", and the "World Health Organization" (WHO) contributed the most to this field orderly. Researchers from the USA with 372 (32.63%), Brazil with 267 (23.42%), and England with 150 (13.2%) documents had the most scientific collaboration on publishing in this regard. The USA and England had the most collaboration in 38 articles in the co-authorship network of countries. Based on topic modelling analysis, five topic clusters, including "maternal mortality", "child and infant mortality", "risk factors related to pregnancy and maternal health", "Geographic Information Systems (GISs)", and "data quality in Health Information Systems (HISs)" were considered for this research. According to the research results, it can be concluded that there is a rising trend in the number of articles published in the field of information systems in maternal health. The USA, Brazil, and England have played a prominent role in scientific production in this regard. Given that this study gives a snapshot of the current status of the research topic and visualizes the collaboration between countries, the obtained results can guide future collaboration and encourage scientific institutes to expand their interactions. © 2023,International Journal of Information Science and Management.

AB  - Economics in Europe has become more international since the 1970s. To a certain extent, this internationalisation is also an ‘Americanisation’ as many European economists have adopted the standards and approaches of US economics. This prompts an important question: amidst this convergence, are there any fields that have managed to retain a distinctively European character? In this article, we use topic modelling and bibliometric coupling to identify European specialties between 1969 and 2002. We focus on macroeconomic articles published in the European Economic Review and compare their bibliographic references and textual content to what has been published in the top 5 journals. Despite economics internationalization since the 1970s, European macroeconomics displayed distinct characteristics across two distinct periods. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, European macroeconomists maintained a certain distance from US debates centred around rational expectations and new classical economics. However, they embraced the concept of microfoundations through the lens of disequilibrium theory, fostering transnational collaborations and offering a unique framework for addressing various macroeconomic issues. Nevertheless, both the prominence of new classical economics in the US and the decline of the disequilibrium approach after the mid-1980s, European macroeconomics shifted towards closer alignment with US approaches. In the 1990s, Political economy, inspired by pioneering US contributions like Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Barro and Gordon (1983a,b), emerged in the 1990s as a new framework offering a common language for many European macroeconomists. However, specific European challenges like high unemployment rates and European integration continued to drive research in distinctive directions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The landscape of Demand-Side Energy Management (DSM) research is rapidly evolving, shaped by technological innovations and policy developments. This paper presents an exhaustive bibliometric analysis and methodological framework to explore the research trends within the DSM domain. By synthesizing data from Scopus and OpenAlex, we compile a comprehensive dataset of DSM publications that serve as the basis for our analysis. Through rigorous data acquisition and cleaning, we ensure the reliability and relevance of our dataset. We employ state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and topic modeling techniques, including GPT and BERTopic, to perform semantic analysis and uncover thematic structures within the literature. Statistical analysis of the literature dataset reveals a steady increase in DSM publications, with significant contributions from prestigious journals and institutions worldwide. We observe that articles are the predominant publication type, while reviews often cite more references and receive higher citation counts. The distribution of publications over time indicates a growing interest in DSM, particularly since 2014. Geographical mapping of institutions highlights key regions contributing to DSM research, with notable outputs from Europe, North America, and East Asia. Coupled with citation network analysis, our approach reveals the influential works and emerging trends that define the scientific progression of DSM research. Our unsupervised topic modeling, powered by BERTopic, clusters the publications into distinct themes, while our advanced visualization techniques using UMAP and t-SNE provide insights into the semantic space of DSM literature. The resulting thematic classification is presented in a hierarchical structure, offering a comprehensive understanding of the field's focus areas. Our citation network analysis, utilizing force-directed graph computation and edge-bundling algorithms, maps the interconnectivity and impact of research contributions, providing a dynamic view of the field's evolution. This study not only charts the landscape of DSM research but also offers a methodological blueprint for future bibliometric analyses. The insights gained from this multi-faceted exploration serve as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and industry practitioners looking to navigate the complexities of DSM and contribute to its scientific advancement. © 2024

AB  - The analysis of patent certificates for the purpose of determining the technologies of an industry is a method that has been used by experts and researchers of technology management and technology forecasting for nearly two decades. Meanwhile, using different techniques and software and completing the experiences of past researches have increased the speed, accuracy, and practicality of the relevant reports. In this study, the tire industry has been investigated with regard to its prominent role in the future automobile and transportation industry. All tire-related patent certificates in the last 20 years were extracted from the Derwent Innovation Index database using a search string and IPC codes, and with the help of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) which is an unsupervised machine learning method, the relevant technology areas were extracted. The analysis of technologies and forecasting future technology areas were conducted regarding the share and growth rate of each technology in two 10-year periods (2000–2009 and 2010–2019) and the study of trends and technical indicators related to the industry and value chain. The analysis of nine technology areas considered by tire industry innovators during the last 20 years, as well as the analysis of trends and effective factors on these technologies indicated that the fields of airless tires and intelligent tires technology areas would be highly welcomed in the future and become the dominant and extensively-used technologies of the tire industry in the future. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In recent years, publications on microlearning have substantially increased, as this topic has received extensive attention from scholars in the instructional design and technology discipline. To better characterize and understand microlearning, there is a need for comprehensive bibliometrics assessments of the literature on microlearning. To this end, this bibliometric study collected 208 relevant publications on microlearning from the Scopus database, published in diverse contexts. Using quantitative topic modeling and qualitative content analysis methods, we identified four major themes in these publications, namely: (1) design of microlearning; (2) implementation of microlearning as an instructional method strategy and an intervention; (3) evaluation of microlearning; and (4) the utilization of mobile devices for microlearning. Based on the study findings, we discuss the significance of the study and provide implications for research and practice, particularly in fostering rigorous inquiry on the topic of microlearning, expanding the context of research to include K-12 settings, and focusing on mobile-based microlearning. © 2022, Association for Educational Communications & Technology.

AB  - Policymakers and funding agencies tend to support scientific work across disciplines, thereby relying on indicators for interdisciplinarity. Recently, text-based quantitative methods have been proposed for the computation of interdisciplinarity that hold promise to have several advantages over the bibliometric approach. In this paper, we provide a systematic analysis of the computation of the text-based Rao index, based on probabilistic topic models, comparing a classical LDA model versus a neural network topic model. We provide a systematic analysis of model parameters that affect the diversity scores and make the interaction between its different components explicit. We present an empirical study on a real data set, upon which we quantify the diversity of the research within several departments of Fraunhofer and Max Planck Society by means of scientific abstracts published in Scopus between 2008 and 2018. Our experiments show that parameter variations, i.e. the choice of the Number of topics, hyper-parameters, and size and balance of the underlying data used for training the model, have a strong effect on the topic model-based Rao metrics. In particular, we could observe that the quality of the topic models impacts on the downstream task of computing the Rao index. Topic models that yield semantically cohesive topics are less affected by fluctuations when varying over the number of topics, and result in more stable measurements of the Rao index. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - This study identifies the topical areas of research that have attempted a psychological approach to soccer research over the last 33 years (1990–2022) and explored the growth and stagnation of the topic as well as research contributions to soccer development. Data were obtained from 1863 papers from the Web of Science database. The data were collected through keyword text mining and data preprocessing to determine the keywords needed for analysis. Based on the keywords, latent Dirichlet allocation-based topic modeling analysis was performed to analyze the topic distribution of papers and explore research trends by topic area. The topic modeling process included four topic area and fifty topics. The “Coaching Essentials in Football” topic area had the highest frequency, but it was not statistically identified as a trend. However, coaching, including training, is expected to continue to be an important research topic, as it is a key requirement for success in the highly competitive elite football world. Interest in the research field of “Psychological Skills for Performance Development” has waned in recent years. This may be due to the predominance of other subject areas rather than a lack of interest. Various high-tech interventions and problem-solving attempts are being made in this field, providing opportunities for qualitative and quantitative expansion. “Motivation, cognition, and emotion” is a largely underrated subject area in soccer psychology. This could be because survey-based psychological evaluation attempts have decreased as the importance of rapid field application has been emphasized in recent soccer-related studies. However, measuring psychological factors contributes to the study of football psychology through a new methodology and theoretical background. Recognizing the important role of psychological factors in player performance and mental management, as well as presenting new research directions and approaches that can be directly applied to the field, will advance soccer psychology research. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Advancements in knowledge are pivotal to academic progress, necessitating efficient methods for discovering the state-of-the-art in various fields. Existing approaches, however, are language-specific and lack automation, limiting their efficacy. This study aims to develop a language-agnostic software that streamlines the process of identifying state-of-the-art research across diverse academic topics. The software automatically retrieves articles from multiple databases and preprocesses the content through tokenization, case folding, token cleansing, stopword removal, and lemmatization. Subsequently, a numeric document-phrase matrix is created and analyzed using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) to discover and label topics automatically. The study introduces a novel topic-filtering method based on entity linking and filtering model outputs using a knowledge database to ensure topic relevance. The visual representation employs nested bubble and line charts, effectively illustrating current topics, gaps, and research evolution trends. A user survey spread to 52 student researchers assessing the interface, topic relevance, and research output of the developed software, revealed that the interface is user-friendly, easy to navigate, and the presented information is comprehensible. Survey results also indicated that the generated topics are consistent with the processed article content and relevant to the investigated topic. The visualization effectively aids in understanding the state-of-the-art and research map. This study demonstrates that integrating LDA, BERT, and the proposed topic filtering and labeling method yields a robust tool for preliminary research analysis with high precision and relevance.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Academic interest concerning inclusion of sustainability principles in the field of procurement has been in steady increase over the last 20 years. However, there is an apparent void in bibliometric analyses in this field. To address this gap, VosViewer is used in this study to examine the academic literature on responsible sourcing. 575 peer-reviewed papers from Scopus were analyzed to reveal important topics, authors, and publications connected to the subject in hand. The first part of the analysis analyzed publication activity and listed all high impact journals covering the topic. Geographical distribution of findings showed that developed countries are the most productive in the field, in addition to an increasing interest from developing countries over the last decade. Keyword analysis generated from Vosviewer yielded to four main clusters covering the topic and shaping the intellectual structure of the study: (1) sustainable development & supply chain management, (2) environmental impact of procurement, (3) lifecycle analysis, (4) social responsibility and ethical sourcing. The article discusses the four main clusters and ends with concluding remarks encompassing six knowledge gaps and potential future research fields. © 2023 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG-7) promises to ensure the affordable and clean energy to the world. The United Nations (UN) has set a target for 2030, which can only be achieved through academic excellence. The present study aims to analyze the academic research support of SDG 7 from a global perspective by using bibliometric analysis and topic modelling approaches using Orange Python-based software. The present study extracts the scholarly publications from the lens database from 2015 to 2022 and the dataset consisted of 918 publications with 18,377 citations related to the SDG 7. These including 121 single-author and 797 multiple-authors publications. Most of the papers have been published in open-access journals. Environmental Science and Pollution Research International (5343 citations; 225 publications and CPP 23.74) was the most impactful journal, Muntasir Murshed (13 publications, 421 citations, CPP 32.3) was the most influential author, and China was the most productive country. Under co-occurrence analysis, Clean Energy, Environmental Economics, Health, Affordable Energy, Climate Change, and Business, six different denoted clusters were found, while in the topic modeling approach, six key topics were identified, in which three topics were related to economics and the other were energy-related and climate change. Environmental, renewable energy, and economics were the top words used in SDG 7, and six key documents on each topic were identified according to the distribution and weighting of the topics. The Implications of the research findings and addressing research gaps can inform researchers, policymakers, and funding agencies involved in advancing SDG 7 to help accelerate the achievement of the SDGs in the decision-making process. © 2024 Phcog.Net.

AB  - The term “digital natives” was introduced in 2001 to describe a generation that has grown up surrounded by technology and the internet. The accompanying claims of a new way of thinking among digital natives were influential in shaping educational policy. Still, they were challenged by research that found no evidence of generation-wide cognitive changes in learners. Yet, the digital natives narrative persists in popular media and the education discourse. This study set out to investigate the reasons for the persistence of the digital native myth. It analyzed the metadata from 1886 articles related to the term between 2001 and 2022 using bibliometric methods and structural topic modeling. The results show that the concept of “digital native” is still both warmly embraced and fiercely criticized by scholars mostly from western and high income countries, and the volume of research on the topic is growing. However, the results suggest that what appears as the persistence of the idea is actually evolution and complete reinvention: The way the “digital native” concept is operationalized has shifted over time through a series of (metaphorical) mutations. The concept of digital native is one (albeit a highly successful) mutation of the generational gap discourse dating back to the early 1900s. While the initial digital native literature relied on Prensky's unvalidated claims and waned upon facing empirical challenges, subsequent versions have sought more nuanced interpretations. Notably, a burgeoning third mutation now co-opts the “digital native” terminology for diverse purposes, often completely decoupled from the foundational literature and its critiques. This study explains the concept's persistence as dynamic evolution of the digital native discourse in contemporary academic and public spheres. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - The digital twin has recently become a popular topic in research related to manufacturing, such as Industry 4.0, the industrial internet of things, and cyber-physical systems. In addition, digital twins are the focus of several research areas: construction, urban management, digital transformation of the economy, medicine, virtual reality, software testing, and others. The concept is not yet fully defined, its scope seems unlimited, and the topic is relatively new; all this can present a barrier to research. The main goal of this paper is to develop a proper methodology for visualizing the digital-twin science landscape using modern bibliometric tools, text-mining and topic-modeling, based on machine learning models—Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The scope of the study includes 8693 publications on the topic selected from the Scopus database, published between January 1993 and September 2022. Keyword co-occurrence analysis and topic-modeling indicate that studies on digital twins are still in the early stage of development. At the same time, the core of the topic is growing, and some topic clusters are emerging. More than 100 topics can be identified; the most popular and fastest-growing topic is ‘digital twins of industrial robots, production lines and objects.’ Further efforts are needed to verify the proposed methodology, which can be achieved by analyzing other research fields. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This research aims to analyze the contribution of univariate and relational citation analysis methods, applied to patents, for the identification and characterization of scientific-technological domains, in documents indexed in the Derwent Innovation Index database. The adopted method was patentometrics associated with bibliometrics, using joint analysis of the relational bibliometric citation methods: co-citation and bibliographic coupling. The corpus of the study is composed of 144 patent families. Through the bibliographic coupling, 5 theme clusters and researchers with well-defined thematic domains were observed. Employing co-citation, 23 clusters were identified, characterizing the epistemic domains related to technological currents in which stem cell inventors operate. Such results allowed us to prospect the scientific-technological scenario in this theme, which can illustrate some institutions’ innovation potentials and explain who the actors at the forefront of such research are. It is proposed that applying this methodology allies to topic modeling techniques. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: Numerous uveitis articles were published in this century, underneath which hides valuable intelligence. We aimed to characterize the evolution and patterns in this field. Methods: We divided the 15,994 uveitis papers into four consecutive time periods for bibliometric analysis, and applied latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling and machine learning techniques to the latest period. Results: The yearly publication pattern fitted the curve: 1.21335x2 − 4,848.95282x + 4,844,935.58876 (R2 = 0.98311). The USA, the most productive country/region, focused on topics like ankylosing spondylitis and biologic therapy, whereas China (mainland) focused on topics like OCT and Behcet disease. The logistic regression showed the highest accuracy (71.6%) in the test set. Conclusion: In this century, a growing number of countries/regions/authors/journals are involved in the uveitis study, promoting the scientific output and thematic evolution. Our pioneering study uncovers the evolving academic trends and frontier patterns in this field using bibliometric analysis and AI algorithms. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI), conceived in the 1950s, has permeated numerous industries, intensifying in tandem with advancements in computing power. Despite the widespread adoption of AI, its integration into medicine trails other sectors. However, medical AI research has experienced substantial growth, attracting considerable attention from researchers and practitioners. Objective: In the absence of an existing framework, this study aims to outline the current landscape of medical AI research and provide insights into its future developments by examining all AI-related studies within PubMed over the past 2 decades. We also propose potential data acquisition and analysis methods, developed using Python (version 3.11) and to be executed in Spyder IDE (version 5.4.3), for future analogous research. Methods: Our dual-pronged approach involved (1) retrieving publication metadata related to AI from PubMed (spanning 2000-2022) via Python, including titles, abstracts, authors, journals, country, and publishing years, followed by keyword frequency analysis and (2) classifying relevant topics using latent Dirichlet allocation, an unsupervised machine learning approach, and defining the research scope of AI in medicine. In the absence of a universal medical AI taxonomy, we used an AI dictionary based on the European Commission Joint Research Centre AI Watch report, which emphasizes 8 domains: reasoning, planning, learning, perception, communication, integration and interaction, service, and AI ethics and philosophy. Results: From 2000 to 2022, a comprehensive analysis of 307,701 AI-related publications from PubMed highlighted a 36-fold increase. The United States emerged as a clear frontrunner, producing 68,502 of these articles. Despite its substantial contribution in terms of volume, China lagged in terms of citation impact. Diving into specific AI domains, as the Joint Research Centre AI Watch report categorized, the learning domain emerged dominant. Our classification analysis meticulously traced the nuanced research trajectories across each domain, revealing the multifaceted and evolving nature of AI’s application in the realm of medicine. Conclusions: The research topics have evolved as the volume of AI studies increases annually. Machine learning remains central to medical AI research, with deep learning expected to maintain its fundamental role. Empowered by predictive algorithms, pattern recognition, and imaging analysis capabilities, the future of AI research in medicine is anticipated to concentrate on medical diagnosis, robotic intervention, and disease management. Our topic modeling outcomes provide a clear insight into the focus of AI research in medicine over the past decades and lay the groundwork for predicting future directions. The domains that have attracted considerable research attention, primarily the learning domain, will continue to shape the trajectory of AI in medicine. Given the observed growing interest, the domain of AI ethics and philosophy also stands out as a prospective area of increased focus. © 2023 Journal of Medical Internet Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - Systematic maps are used to comprehensively gather and describe the literature on a topic, which is often defined by policy and practice relevance and stakeholder input, identifying trends and gaps in research. Bibliometric methods elucidate the connections between publications, for example, providing information about collaboration in research communities. Research weaving combines these approaches to produce a comprehensive view of research activity on a well-defined research area. In this paper, we conduct and describe a bibliometric analysis on a previously published systematic map on the functional roles of buffer strips in agricultural fields. Among other findings, the original systematic map found a paucity of studies addressing multiple functional roles and a huge variation in terminology related to buffer strips. We used research weaving to deepen our understanding of these findings and shed light on collaboration within and among the research communities contributing knowledge to this field. Of the 1019 papers originally included in the systematic map, 930 were identified in Lens.org and used for subsequent analyses. Co-authorship and bibliographic coupling networks identified distinct research communities, defined by geography, subdiscipline and characteristic usage of buffer strip terminology. Topic modelling provided further information about these subcommunities and aligned with manually extracted information about the studies' focus on functional roles, indicating potential utility for screening of records in large systematic maps. Practical Implication: We demonstrate that research weaving methods add insights in support of and in addition to the original systematic map. We provide a methodological approach and discuss limitations related to applying bibliometric analyses to a previously published systematic map. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and its ability to enhance and enrich the findings gained from conventional systematic mapping techniques. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - As a human-friendly system, the artificial intelligence (AI) robot is one of the critical applications in promoting precision education. Alongside the call for humanity-oriented applications in education, AI robotsupported precision education has developed into an active field, with increasing literature available. This study aimed to comprehensively analyze directions taken in the past in this research field to interpret a roadmap for future work. By adopting structural topic modeling, the Mann-Kendall trend test, and keyword analysis, we investigated the research topics and their dynamics in the field based on literature collected from Web of Science and Scopus databases up to 2021. Results showed that AI robots and chatbots had been widely used in different subject areas (e.g., early education, STEM education, medical, nursing, and healthcare education, and language education) for promoting collaborative learning, mobile/game-based learning, distance learning, and affective learning. However, a limited practice in developing true human-centered AI (HCAI)-supported educational robots is available. To advance HCAI in education and its application in educational robots for precision education, we suggested involving humans in AI robot design, thinking of individual learners, testing, and understanding the learner–AI robot interaction, taking an HCAI multidisciplinary approach in robot system development, and providing sufficient technical support for instructors during robot implementation. © 2023,Educational Technology and Society.All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Social science research on the environment has grown exponentially in the past four decades alongside increasing awareness that environmental risks, such as climate change, cannot be understood by natural science interventions alone. While prior research examines how specific disciplines, like sociology, have attended to the environment or how specific problems have been engaged across disciplines, less attention has been offered to the entire landscape of research on the environment in the social sciences. In this article, we ask: What is the landscape of environmental social science? Focusing on 124,906 social scientific articles from the Web of Science, we analyze the relationship between journals publishing research on the environment. Specifically, we construct journal citation networks and topic models on bibliographic records from 1990 to 2022. Results suggest that journals form coherent communities associated with both disciplinary and interdisciplinary research topics, indicating that journal communities may be a central organizing feature of ESS. Moreover, research topics prevalent in this field have changed over time, potentially in relation to the ongoing neoliberalization of climate change politics. As scholars want to influence policy and industrial practice, their research implicitly reflects values consistent with the current political economic order. We conclude by highlighting the implications of these findings for the field of environmental social science. © 2024 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.

Results suggest that Edu-Metaverse has been gaining increasing attention in academia since 2019. Countries/affiliations located in the same regions are close partners in scientific cooperation. By jointly interpreting topic modeling and keyword analysis results, this study reveals eight main themes in the field of Edu-Metaverse: 1) Metaverse-based physical education; 2) Metaverse-supported simulations for collaborative problem-based learning (PBL) in health/medical education; 3) 3-D virtual learning environment-supported art appreciation and creation in art education; 4) Metaverse-enabled laboratories for STEM education; 5) language and 21st century skill development through Metaverse-supported immersive language learning; 6) Metaverse for developing autism children' social communication abilities; 7) virtual world Metaverse-supported gameful experience-based education; and 8) quantitative research on Edu-Metaverse focusing on learners' experience. We also identified challenges and directions needing further attention: 1) data security and privacy protection; 2) balance between the real world and virtual world identities; 3) preparing instructors for Edu-Metaverse; and 4) assessment of higher-order thinking competencies in Edu-Metaverse-based PBL. This work helps facilitate researchers' and practitioners' understanding of Edu-Metaverse research and raises their awareness of research frontiers and future directions.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose: Intensive care medicine (ICM) has the particularity of being a multidisciplinary specialty and its literature reflects this multidisciplinarity. However, the proportion of each field in this literature and its trend dynamics are not known. The objective of this study was to analyze the ICM literature, extract latent topics and search for the presence of research trends. Material and methods: Abstracts of original articles from the top ICM journals, from their inception until December 31st, 2019, were included. This corpus was fed into a structural topic modeling algorithm to extract latent semantic topics. The temporal distribution was then analyzed and the presence of trends was searched by Mann-Kendall trends tests. Results: Finally, 49,276 articles from 10 journals were included. After topic modeling analysis and experts' feedback, 124 research topics were selected and labeled. Topics were categorized into 19 categories, the most represented being respiratory, fundamental and neurological research. Increasing trends were observed for research on mechanical ventilation and decreasing trends for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Conclusions: This study reviewed all articles from major ICM journals in a comprehensive way. It provides a better understanding of ICM research landscape by analyzing the temporal evolution of latent research topics in the ICM literature. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The rapid increase in the amount of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the utilization of fossil fuels to meet global energy needs has made the transition to cleaner energy sources imperative. Past studies show that energy transition not only improves the environment that we live in but is also a means to fulfill many of the United Nation's sustainable development goals. Even though studies as early as the 1980s focused on energy transition, there has been a spurt in the volume of literature in the mentioned area over the last five years (post-2018). Consequently, researchers face a daunting task in scanning through this large literature body and identifying the key research trends and gray areas in energy transition research. The current study tries to address this problem by the use of an unsupervised machine learning technique 'topic modeling via latent Dirichlet allocation model' implemented on the abstracts of 1221 research articles (related to energy transition) extracted from the Scopus database. The topic modeling approach reveals eight meaningfully interpretable unique topics. The use of technology and models for energy transition, energy transition and policy, environmental impacts of energy transition, and the impact of transition on energy markets are the most researched topics. However, benefits from energy transition, energy distribution, importance, and socio-economic impacts of energy transition are largely understudied. The study not only conducts a comprehensive analysis of the energy transition literature but also provides lots of implications and future research directions for the benefit of various stakeholders.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose: This study employs bibliometric analysis to map the research landscape of social media trending topics during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors aim to offer a comprehensive review of the predominant research organisations and countries, key themes and favoured research methodologies pertinent to this subject. Design/methodology/approach: The authors extracted data on social media trending topics from the Web of Science Core Collection database, spanning from 2009 to 2022. A total of 1,504 publications were subjected to bibliometric analysis, utilising the VOSviewer tool. The study analytical process encompassed co-occurrence, co-authorship, citation analysis, field mapping, bibliographic coupling and co-citation analysis. Findings: Interest in social media research, particularly on trending topics during the COVID-19 pandemic, remains high despite signs of the pandemic stabilising globally. The study predominantly addresses misinformation and public health communication, with notable focus on interactions between governments and the public. Recent studies have concentrated on analysing Twitter user data through text mining, sentiment analysis and topic modelling. The authors also identify key leading organisations, countries and journals that are central to this research area. Originality/value: Diverging from the narrow focus of previous literature reviews on social media, which are often confined to particular fields or sectors, this study offers a broad view of social media's role, emphasising trending topics. The authors demonstrate a significant link between social media trends and public events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper discusses research priorities that emerged during the pandemic and outlines potential methodologies for future studies, advocating for a greater emphasis on qualitative approaches.

AB  - Purpose: This paper explores the Adoption of Technological Innovation (ATI) in the healthcare industry. It investigates how the literature has evolved, and what are the emerging innovation dimensions in the healthcare industry adoption studies. Design/methodology/approach: We followed a mixed-method approach combining bibliometric methods and topic modeling, with 57 papers being deeply analyzed. Findings: Our results identify three latent topics. The first one is related to the digitalization in healthcare with a specific focus on the COVID-19 pandemic. The second one groups up the word combinations dealing with the research models and their constructs. The third one refers to the healthcare systems/professionals and their resistance to ATI. Research limitations/implications: The study’s sample selection focused on scientific journals included in the Academic Journal Guide and in the FT Research Rank. However, the paper identifies trends that offer managerial insights for stakeholders in the healthcare industry. Practical implications: ATI has the potential to revolutionize the health service delivery system and to decentralize services traditionally provided in hospitals or medical centers. All this would contribute to a reduction in waiting lists and the provision of proximity services. Originality/value: The originality of the paper lies in the combination of two methods: bibliometric analysis and topic modeling. This approach allowed us to understand the ATI evolutions in the healthcare industry. © 2024, Nicola Cobelli and Silvia Blasi.

AB  - Introduction: Over the last decade, there has been a growing interest in cereal-legume intercropping for sustainable agriculture. As a result numerous papers, including reviews, focus on this topic. Screening this large amount of papers, to identify knowledge gaps and future research opportunities, manually, would be a complex and time consuming task. Materials and methods: Bibliometric analysis combined with text mining and topic modelling, to automatically find topics and to derive a representation of intercropping papers as a potential solution to reduce the workload was tested. Both common (e.g. wheat and soybean) as well as underutilized crops (e.g. buckwheat, lupin, triticale) were the focus of this study. The corpus used for the analysis was retrieved from Web of Science and Scopus on 5th September 2022 and consisted of 4,732 papers. Results: The number of papers on cereal-legume intercropping increased in recent years, with most studies being located in China. Literature mainly dealt with the cereals maize and wheat and the legume soybean whereas buckwheat and lupin received little attention from academic researchers. These underutilized crops are certainly interesting to be used as intercropping partners, however, additional research on optimization of management and cultivar’s choice is important. Yield and nitrogen fixation are the most commonly studied traits in cereal-legume intercropping. Last decade, there is an increasing interest in climate resilience, sustainability and biodiversity. Also the term “ecosystem services” came into play, but still with a low frequency. The regulating services and provisioning services seem to be the most studied, in contrast terms related to potential cultural services were not encountered. Discussion: In conclusion, based on this review several research opportunities were identified. Minor crops like lupin and buckwheat need to be evaluated for their role as intercropping partners. The interaction between species based on e.g. root exudates needs to be further unraveled. Also diseases, pests and weeds in relation to intercropping deserve more attention and finally more in-depth research on the additional benefits/ecosystem services associated with intercropping systems is necessary.

AB  - Scientific cooperation is gaining importance as worldwide trends in co-authorship indicate. While clustering is an established method in this field and several have studied scientific-cooperation dynamics within a single discipline, little literature exists on its interdisciplinary facet. This paper analyses the evolution of co-authorship amongst social scientists in Slovenia over the three decades between 1991 and 2020 using bibliographic databases. The identification of groups (clusters) of authors based on patterns in their co-authorship ties both within and across decades is carried out using network-analytical method called stochastic blockmodeling (SBM). Meanwhile, previous research used generalised blockmodeling accounting only for within-period ties. Additionally, a topic model is developed to tentatively assess whether co-authorship is driven by research interests, organisational or disciplinary affiliation. Notably, while focusing on the result of the SBM for generalised multipartite networks, the paper draw compares with other SBMs. Generally, the paper identifies clusters of authors that are larger and less cohesive than those found in previous works. Specifically, there are three main findings. First, disciplines appear to become less important over time. Second, institutions remain central, corroborating the suggestion that Slovenian R&D policy reinforces parochial research practices. Yet, whether organisational segregation is an issue remains unclear. Third, interdisciplinarity’s emergence has been slow and partial, thus supporting the idea of a ‘covert interdisciplinarity.’ Importantly, it seems that members of different clusters lack fluency in a meta-language enabling effective communication across cognate paradigms. And this may hinder the implementation of long-term, up-to-date research policies in the country. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Research on financial literacy has increased over time, particularly in light of the severe effects of the 2008 global financial crisis and the necessity of empowering individuals’ financial well-being. This study employs bibliometric analysis to reaffirm the multidisciplinary nature of this topic. It displays the most influential authors, journals, articles, keywords, and time trends. In addition, using topic modeling, this study reveals the top ten sub-topics discussed in 2,538 Web of Science-extracted publications over the past quarter-century (1998–2022). Some sub-topics have persisted over time (e.g., financial education), whereas others were introduced much later (e.g., entrepreneurialism). Future research should use the findings of this study to categorize the relevant theories in financial literacy and investigate unexplored topics. © (2023), (Social Sciences Research Society).

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has brought unprecedented growth and productivity in every socioeconomic sector. AI adoption in education is transformational through reduced teacher workload, individualized learning, intelligent tutors, profiling and prediction, high-precision education, collaboration, and learner tracking. This paper highlights the trajectory of AI research in higher education (HE) through bibliometric analysis and topic modeling approaches. We used the PRISMA guidelines to select 304 articles published in the Scopus database between 2012 and 2021. VOSviewer was used for visualization and text-mining to identify hotspots in the field. Latent Dirichlet Allocation analysis reveals distinct topics in the dynamic relationship between AI and HE. Only 9.6% of AI research in HE was achieved in the first seven years, with the last three years contributing 90.4%. China, the United States, Russia and the United Kingdom dominated publications. Four themes emerged–data as the catalyst, the development of AI, the adoption of AI in HE and emerging trends and the future of AI in HE. Topic modeling on the abstracts revealed the 10 most frequent topics and the top 30 most salient terms. This research contributes to the literature by synthesizing AI adoption opportunities in HE, topic modeling and future research areas. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Currently, studies involving a digital twin are gaining widespread interest. While the first fields adopting such a concept were in manufacturing and engineering, lately, interest extends also beyond these fields across all academic disciplines. Given the inviting idea behind a digital twin which allows the efficient exploitation and utilization of simulations such a trend is understandable. The purpose of this paper is to use a scientometrics approach to study the early publication history of the digital twin across academia. Our analysis is based on large-scale bibliographic and citation data from Scopus that provides authoritative information about high-quality publications in essentially all fields of science, engineering and humanities. This paper has four major objectives. First, we obtain a global overview of all publications related to a digital twin across all major subject areas. This analysis provides insights into the structure of the entire publication corpus. Second, we investigate the co-occurrence of subject areas appearing together on publications. This reveals interdisciplinary relations of the publications and identifies the most collaborative fields. Third, we conduct a trend and keyword analysis to gain insights into the evolution of the concept and the importance of keywords. Fourth, based on results from topic modeling using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model we introduce the definition of a scientometric dimension (SD) of digital twin research that allows to summarize an important aspect of the bound diversity of the academic literature.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Background: In the field of medical imaging, the rapid rise of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has presented significant opportunities for conserving healthcare resources. However, with the wide spread application of CNNs, several challenges have emerged, such as enormous data annotation costs, difficulties in ensuring user privacy and security, weak model interpretability, and the consumption of substantial computational resources. The fundamental challenge lies in optimizing and seamlessly integrating CNN technology to enhance the precision and efficiency of medical diagnosis. Methods: This study sought to provide a comprehensive bibliometric overview of current research on the application of CNNs in medical imaging. Initially, bibliometric methods were used to calculate the frequency statistics, and perform the cluster analysis and the co-citation analysis of countries, institutions, authors, keywords, and references. Subsequently, the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) method was employed for the topic modeling of the literature. Next, an in-depth analysis of the topics was conducted, and the topics in the medical field, technical aspects, and trends in topic evolution were summarized. Finally, by integrating the bibliometrics and LDA results, the developmental trajectory, milestones, and future directions in this field were outlined. Results: A data set containing 6,310 articles in this field published from January 2013 to December 2023 was complied. With a total of 55,538 articles, the United States led in terms of the citation count, while in terms of the publication volume, China led with 2,385 articles. Harvard University emerged as the most influential institution, boasting an average of 69.92 citations per article. Within the realm of CNNs, residual neural network (ResNet) and U-Net stood out, receiving 1,602 and 1,419 citations, respectively, which highlights the significant attention these models have received. The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was unmistakable, as reflected by the publication of 597 articles, making it a focal point of research. Additionally, among various disease topics, with 290 articles, brain-related research was the most prevalent. Computed tomography (CT) imaging dominated the research landscape, representing 73% of the 30 different topics. Conclusions: Over the past 11 years, CNN-related research in medical imaging has grown exponentially. The findings of the present study provide insights into the field’s status and research hotspots. In addition, this article meticulously chronicled the development of CNNs and highlighted key milestones, starting with LeNet in 1989, followed by a challenging 20-year exploration period, and culminating in the breakthrough moment with AlexNet in 2012. Finally, this article explored recent advancements in CNN technology, including semi-supervised learning, efficient learning, trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI), and federated learning methods, and also addressed challenges related to data annotation costs, diagnostic efficiency, model performance, and data privacy. © Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery.

AB  - Today, assumptions about probable future developments (at least as far as they make use of quantifiable scientific methods and are not pure speculation) are generally based on data from the past. An interesting way to analyze the future through this type of data is text mining or individual methods out of the spectrum of text mining, such as topic modeling. Topic Modeling itself is a combination of quantitative and qualitative methodology and is based on the full spectrum of social science methodology. Therefore, the method is an interesting way for futures research to analyze futures. This publication addresses the question of how a combination of different methods can contribute to trend monitoring or trend mining. For this purpose, a set of scientific publications was first generated with the help of a search query in the Web of Science (WoS), which is the basis for all evaluations and statements and topics. In essence, the method considered here should be more fully integrated into the scientific practice of futures research because it can make a valuable contribution to estimating future development based on past development. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - In response to the many changes and uncertainties facing the future, sensing opportunities for innovation is an important agenda. Formulating strategies for sensing opportunities in innovation requires an ecosystem perspective that integrates the science, technology, and business (S-T-B) fields that shape the innovation ecosystem. This study was to identify potential in the innovation ecosystem focusing on a text mining technique and similarity-based analysis, which is the fundamental concept of Literature-Based Discovery, an approach to deriving hidden associations between two areas in bibliometric databases. The purpose of this study was sensing innovation opportunities through intelligent trends and interaction analysis in S-T-B fields in the value chain of smart grids, which is the research target area. Topic modeling, and cosine similarity measurements were carried out using scientific papers, patents, business publication data corresponding to the S-T-B ecosystem. Through multi-dimensional data sources corresponding to the S-T-B fields, the evolutionary path of the smart grid value chain and its potential as a strategic tool for future innovative challenges were identified. This study has practical and policy implications in that it identifies a niche in the innovation system and provides meaningful information that could contribute to the revitalization of participation in the private sector and consumers. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Metaverse technology is an advanced form of virtual reality and augmented technologies. It merges the digital world with the real world, thus benefitting healthcare services. Medical informatics is promising in the metaverse. Despite the increasing adoption of the metaverse in commercial applications, a considerable research gap remains in the academic domain, which hinders the comprehensive delineation of research prospects for the metaverse in healthcare. This study employs text-mining methods to investigate the prevalence and trends of the metaverse in healthcare; in particular, more than 34,000 academic articles and news reports are analyzed. Subsequently, the topic prevalence, similarity, and correlation are measured using topic-modeling methods. Based on bibliometric analysis, this study proposes a theoretical framework from the perspectives of knowledge, socialization, digitization, and intelligence. This study provides insights into its application in healthcare via an extensive literature review. The key to promoting the metaverse in healthcare is to perform technological upgrades in computer science, telecommunications, healthcare services, and computational biology. Digitization, virtualization, and hyperconnectivity technologies are crucial in advancing healthcare systems. Realizing their full potential necessitates collective support and concerted effort toward the transformation of relevant service providers, the establishment of a digital economy value system, and the reshaping of social governance and health concepts. The results elucidate the current state of research and offer guidance for the advancement of the metaverse in healthcare. © 2023 Xi'an Jiaotong University

AB  - This study aims to reveal the dominant research interests and models in serious games research using topic modeling analysis. The dataset of this study covers a comprehensive collection of 2676 articles from the past to the end of 2022, indexed in the Scopus database. The study begins by presenting descriptive attributes of the articles, including their publication years, subject areas, and the journals in which they are published. Subsequently, employing topic modeling analysis, a form of unsupervised machine learning, the study identifies concealed themes, research interests, and tendencies within the literature. The findings indicate a notable surge in publications in this domain, particularly post-2009 and 2019. Furthermore, the study identifies eleven primary topics dominating the literature, with notable emphasis on 'Training of STEM-related fields,' 'Programming learning,' and 'Medical education'. To gauge the dynamics within these topics, the study calculates accelerations both within individual topics and in comparison to others over time. Remarkably, 'Child and adolescent health' emerges as the topic with the highest self-acceleration, while 'Medical education' stands out for its acceleration in comparison to other topics. In sum, the outcomes of this study, which provides a comprehensive overview of the serious games field, are anticipated to yield valuable insights for understanding the current landscape, guiding future research endeavors, and shaping the trajectory of this field.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - A fundamental structural transformation that must occur to break global temperature rise and advance sustainable development is the green transition to a low-carbon system. However, dismantling the carbon lock-in situation requires substantial investment in green finance. Historically, investments have been concentrated in carbon-intensive technologies. Nonetheless, green finance has blossomed in recent years, and efforts to organise this literature have emerged, but a deeper understanding of this growing field is needed. For this goal, this paper aims to delineate this literature’s existing groups and explore its heterogeneity. From a bibliometric coupling network, we identified the main groups in the literature; then, we described the characteristics of these articles through a novel combination of complex network analysis, topological measures, and a type of unsupervised machine learning technique called structural topic modelling (STM). The use of computational methods to explore literature trends is increasing as it is expected to be compatible with a large amount of information and complement the expert-based knowledge approach. The contribution of this article is twofold: first, identifying the most relevant articles in the network related to each group and, second, the most prestigious topics in the field and their contributions to the literature. A final sample of 3275 articles shows three main groups in the literature. The more mature is mainly related to the distribution of climate finance from the developed to the developing world. In contrast, the most recent ones are related to climate financial risks, green bonds, and the insertion of financial development in energy-emissions-economics models. Researchers and policy-makers can recognise current research challenges and make better decisions with the help of the central research topics and emerging trends identified from STM. The field’s evolution shows a clear movement from an international perspective to a nationally-determined discussion on finance to the green transition. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Organizations are increasingly leveraging the ability of artificial intelligence to analyze and resolve complex problems. This can potentially reshape the interdependencies and interactions of complex systems, leading to our research question: To what extent and in which direction is the literature on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and System Dynamics (SD) converging within the business and management landscape? We conducted an extensive literature review using bibliometric and topic modeling methods to address this question. Through a bibliometric analysis, we identified the areas in which academic papers referred to both SD and AI literature. However, bibliometrics do not show a clear path towards convergence. The top modeling analysis highlights more details on how convergence is structured, providing insights into how SD and AI may be integrated. Two trajectories are identified. In the “soft convergence,” AI supports system dynamics analysis and modeling more deeply characterized by social interaction. In the “hard convergence,” AI shapes innovative ways of rethinking system design, dynamics, and interdependencies. Our analysis suggests that while soft convergence is more visible in the business and management landscape, hard convergence may well represent a new frontier in studying system dynamics with the potential to reshape the landscape. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - High performance work systems have coalesced into an influential body of discourse within human resource management. With the advent of knowledge-based work they have become more fragmented, sector-wise differentiated and critical to performance management. Measuring the impact of this research discipline and understanding it’s patterns is the need of the hour. A large corpus of 730 papers is quantitatively analysed to uncover insights on common research themes, differential influence of these themes and other similarity patterns in respect of authors, institutions, sources and countries that are anchored in the discourse. Bibliographic coupling, collaboration networks, keyword co-occurrence networks and topic modelling are some of the techniques employed. The three prominent research themes are: ‘Reconciling paradigm controversies’, ‘Impact of HPWS on employees’, and ‘HPWS and new workplace dynamics’. Extensive future research directions are suggested. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Management information systems (MIS) have an interdisciplinary structure. Naturally, it develops and changes with the influence of other fields. This study tries to analyze MIS through academic studies on this topic. In this context, the analysis included 25304 articles published in the Scopus database from 2016 to 2021. Then, the performance analysis, part of bibliometric analysis, was used to measure the research productivity and impact of authors, institutions, countries, and journals. This way, the field’s most influential authors, institutions, countries, and journals were determined. Afterward, the articles were gathered under 15 categories with topic modeling. These categories were examined on an annual basis, and more detailed results were tried to be revealed. This study both revealed the primary lines of the MIS field and ended up being a guide for researchers about the topics they can focus on in the future. © 2022 International Association for Computer Information Systems.

AB  - Research and development are central to economic growth, and a key challenge for countries of the global South is that their research performance lags behind that of the global North. Yet, among Southern researchers, a few significantly outperform their peers and can be styled research “positive deviants” (PDs). In this paper we ask: who are those PDs, what are their characteristics and how are they able to overcome some of the challenges facing researchers in the global South? We examined a sample of 203 information systems researchers in Egypt who were classified into PDs and non-PDs (NPDs) through an analysis of their publication and citation data. Based on six citation metrics, we were able to identify and group 26 PDs. We then analysed their attributes, attitudes, practices, and publications using a mixed-methods approach involving interviews, a survey and analysis of publication-related datasets. Two predictive models were developed using partial least squares regression; the first predicted if a researcher is a PD or not using individual-level predictors and the second predicted if a paper is a paper of a PD or not using publication-level predictors. PDs represented 13% of the researchers but produced about half of all publications, and had almost double the citations of the overall NPD group. At the individual level, there were significant differences between both groups with regard to research collaborations, capacity development, and research directions. At the publication level, there were differences relating to the topics pursued, publication outlets targeted, and paper features such as length of abstract and number of authors. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - This study investigated the evolution of library and information science (LIS) by analyzing research topics in LIS journal articles. The analysis is divided into five periods covering the years 1996–2019. Latent Dirichlet allocation modeling was used to identify underlying topics based on 14,035 documents. An improved data-selection method was devised in order to generate a dynamic journal list that included influential journals for each period. Results indicate that (a) library science has become less prevalent over time, as there are no top topic clusters relevant to library issues since the period 2000–2005; (b) bibliometrics, especially citation analysis, is highly stable across periods, as reflected by the stable subclusters and consistent keywords; and (c) information retrieval has consistently been the dominant domain with interests gradually shifting to model-based text processing. Information seeking and behavior is also a stable field that tends to be dispersed among various topics rather than presented as its own subject. Information systems and organizational activities have been continuously discussed and have developed a closer relationship with e-commerce. Topics that occurred only once have undergone a change of technological context from the networks and Internet to social media and mobile applications. © 2020, The Author(s).

We track variation across decision areas and method-usage evolution per analytics type, featuring the degree to which big data (e.g., clickstream, social media, product reviews) and analytics suited for these new data sources (e.g., machine learning) are used. Our analysis reveals a rapidly growing field that is evolving in terms of content (decisions, retail sector), data, and methodology. To determine the state of practice, we interviewed global practitioners on the current use of retail analytics. These interviews shed light on the barriers and enablers of adopting advanced analytics in retail. They also highlight what sets companies on the frontier (e.g., Amazon, Alibaba, Walmart) apart from the rest. Combining the insights from our survey of academic research and interviews with practitioners, we provide directions for future academic research that take advantage of the availability of big data. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The International Journal of Enterprise Network Management (IJENM) has been disseminating innovative research in understanding the complexity of a supply chain in an enterprise-wide scope in various industries using frameworks, adapted theories and configurable models since 2006. In this paper, we study the history of IJENM by analysing the articles published in the journal using text mining and topic modelling to bring out the evolution of topics and focus areas. We used text mining to identify the most frequently occurring terms in the title, keywords and abstract of IJENM papers and constructed co-occurrence network to analyse the interrelationship between focus areas. We then used topic modelling techniques to perform an unsupervised review and analysed the temporal trends of top ten topics in the journal. Our results showed that the focus area of IJENM started with traditional issues related to supply chain, and in the recent years has also started to cover trending topics like analytics, technology and internet of things. Our results indicate the evolving interests of the journal and its readers over the last 15 years and could benefit different stakeholders in the academic community to identify promising topics and realign the focus for journal development.

AB  - Social networks (SN) shape HIV risk behaviors and transmission. This study was performed to quantify research development, patterns, and trends in the use of SN in the field of HIV/AIDS, and used Global publications extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection database. Networks of countries, research disciplines, and most frequently used terms were visualized. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation method was used for topic modeling. A linear regression model was utilized to identify the trend of research development. During the period 1991–2019, in a total of 5,698 publications, topics with the highest volume of publications consisted of (1) mental disorders (16.1%); (2) HIV/sexually transmitted infections prevalence in key populations (9.9%); and (3) HIV-related stigma (9.3%). Discrepancies in the geographical distribution of publications were also observed. This study highlighted (1) the rapid growth of publications on a wide range of topics regarding SN in the field of HIV/AIDS, and (2) the importance of SN in HIV prevention, treatment, and care. The findings of this study suggest the need for interventions using SN and the improvement of research capacity via regional collaborations to reduce the HIV burden in low- and middle-income countries.

AB  - Product Returns (PR) are an inevitable yet costly process in business, especially in the online marketplace. How to deal with the conundrums has attracted a great deal of attention from both practitioners and researchers. This paper aims to synthesise research developments in the PR domain in order to provide an insightful picture of current research and explore future directions for the research community. To ensure research rigour, we adapt a six-step framework - defining the topic, searching databases, cleaning and clustering data, paper selection, content analysis, and discussion. A hybrid approach is adopted for clustering and identifying the distribution and themes in a large number of publications collected from academic databases. The hybrid approach combines machine learning topic modelling and bibliometric analysis. The machine learning results indicate that the overall research can be clustered into three groups: (1) operations management of PR, covering (re)manufacturing network design, product recovery, reverse distribution, and quality of cores; (2) retailer and (re)manufacturer issues including return policy, channel, inventory, pricing, and information strategies; and (3) customer's psychology, experience, and perception on marketing-operation interface. Furthermore, from the content analysis, five potential future directions are discussed, namely digitalisation in the context of PR; globalisation versus localisation in the context of PR; multi-layer (i.e., retailer, manufacturer, logistics provider, online platform) and multi-channel (i.e., online, offline, dual and omni channel) oriented bespoke return policy; understanding and predicting customer return behaviour via online footprints; and customer return perception across the marketing–operations interface. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: Employing bibliometric methods, the present study aimed to map out the general landscape of existing research on eating disorders (EDs) over the past decades. Method: Using the Web of Science database, we retrieved 41,917 research articles related to EDs published from 1981 to 2020. After removing those without an abstract, a total of 37,446 articles were retained. The study outlined the distribution of scholarship by time, languages, regions, and countries, and identified major research lines by applying latent topic modelling. Results: Results revealed a general increasing trend in the number of publications on EDs research, and researchers from Western countries dominated the production of related scholarship. The distribution of published scholarship varied significantly by languages, regions, and countries. Seven main research topics emerged from past research (i.e., animal studies of food intake, risk factors and at-risk groups for eating disorders, body image in eating disorders, studies of cognition and brain in eating disorders, symptomatology and comorbidity of eating disorders, body weight and nutrition status in eating disorders, and treatment of eating disorders), with different topics showing unique research trends across the years. Conclusions: This bibliometric analysis presents the most complete up-to-date overview on published research on EDs. While there is an increasing trend for EDs research, the available research evidence is generally from Western countries; thus, it is suggested that cooperation on EDs research should be strengthened between Western countries and other countries in the future. © 2022 Eating Disorders Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - With the increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in education, the number of published studies in the field has increased. However, no large-scale reviews have been conducted to comprehensively investigate the various aspects of this field. Based on 4,519 publications from 2000 to 2019, we attempt to fill this gap and identify trends and topics related to AI applications in education (AIEd) using topic-based bibliometrics. Results of the review reveal an increasing interest in using AI for educational purposes from the academic community. The main research topics include intelligent tutoring systems for special education; natural language processing for language education; educational robots for AI education; educational data mining for performance prediction; discourse analysis in computer-supported collaborative learning; neural networks for teaching evaluation; affective computing for learner emotion detection; and recommender systems for personalized learning. We also discuss the challenges and future directions of AIEd. © 2022,Educational Technology and Society. All rights reserved

AB  - This article reviews 26 years (1994–2020) of research on electronic business published in reputable journals of the field. The basic aim behind this study is to define the growth potential of electronic business and marketing as a theoretical field and provide insights on past, present, and future scientific production in the field. By using bibliometrics and topic modeling techniques, annual scientific production and growth, latent topic structures, and trends by years, information on total citations and networks were examined. While the authors defined the research orientations by uncovering the main topics associated with electronic business, they created an understanding of the possible future research directions of fourteen topics discovered. The results show that, while the transaction-focused publications prevailed in the early years of electronic business and marketing journals, from the mid2000s, the focus has shifted towards marketing-focused publications. Moreover, to understand the main orientations in the field, the authors conducted a citation analysis to define the most influential topics published in the journals. The article also provides information on the most influential researchers in the field. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - How is community forestry (CF) research changing as CF policies mature around the world? In this research note we use bibliometrics and topic modelling to display trends in the geographic foci and research topics mentioned in the abstracts of CF-related research papers published between 1990 and 2017. We find that studies of CF in South Asia make up a substantial proportion of the literature, although CF research in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America has also developed. Using a structural topic model, we identify four major research areas and 20 topics latent in the text of the abstracts analyzed. The trends of topic proportions over time offer evidence of a shift in research focus from broad policy analysis to local outcomes and growing interest in carbon sequestration. Results identify the most prominent CF research topics and demonstrate the potential of topic models to analyze large amounts of scientific literature. © 2018, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.

AB  - Personalized language learning (PLL), a popular approach to precision language education, plays an increasingly essential role in effective language education to meet diverse learner needs and expectations. Research on PLL has become an active sub-field of research on technology-enhanced language learning and artificial intelligence applications in education. Based on the PLL literature from the Web of Science and Scopus databases, this study identified trends and prominent research issues within the field from 2000 to 2019 using structural topic modeling and bibliometrics. Trend analysis of articles demonstrated increasing interest in PLL research. Journals such as Educational Technology & Society and Computers & Education had contributed much to PLL research. PLL associated closely with mobile learning, game-based learning, and online/web-based learning. Moreover, personalized feedback and recommendations were important issues in PLL. Additionally, there was an increasing interest in adopting learning analytics and artificial intelligence in PLL research. Results obtained could help practitioners and scholars better understand the trends and status of PLL research and become aware of the hot topics and future directions. © 2021, Educational Technology & Society.

AB  - This study investigates the evolution of information science research based on bibliometric analysis and semantic mining. The study discusses the value and application of metadata tagging and topic modeling. Forty-two thousand seven hundred thirty-eight articles were extracted from Clarivate Analytic's Web of Science Core Collection 2010-2020. This study was divided into two phases. Firstly, bibliometric analyzes were performed with VOSviewer. Secondly, the topic identification and evolution trends of information science research were conducted through the topic modeling approach latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) is often used to extract themes from a corpus, and the topic model was a representation of a collection of documents that is simplified using topic-modeling-toolkit (TMT). The top 10 core topics (tags) were information research design, information health-based, model data public, study information studies, analysis effect implications, knowledge support web, data research, social research study, study media information, and research impact time for the studied period. Not only does topic modeling assist in identifying popular topics or related areas within a researcher's area, but it may be used to discover emerging topics or areas of study throughout time. © 2022, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - This study identified the trends in end-of-life care and nursing through text network analysis. About 18,935 articles published until September 2019 were selected through searches on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. For topic modeling, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (K = 8) was applied. Most of the top ranked topic words for the degree and betweenness centralities were consistent with the top 1% through the semantic network diagram. Among the important keywords examined every five years, “care” was unrivaled. When analyzing the two-and three-word combinations, there were many themes representing places, roles, and actions. As a result of performing topic modeling, eight topics were derived as ethical issues of decision-making for treatment withdrawal, symptom management to improve the quality of life, development of end-of-life knowledge education programs, life-sustaining care plan for elderly patients, home-based hospice, communication experience, patient symptom investigation, and an analysis of considering patient preferences. This study is meaningful as it analyzed a large amount of existing literature and considered the main trends of end-of-life care and nursing research based on the core subject control and semantic structure. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This article maps the scientific literature in human mobility behavior in the context of the current pandemic. Through bibliometrics, we analyze the content of published scientific studies indexed on the Web of Science and Scopus during 2020. This enables us the detection of current hotspots and future directions of research. After a co-occurrence of keywords and evidence map analysis, four themes are identified, namely, Land Transport — Operations, Land Transport — Traffic Demand, Air Transport and Environment. We show how air transportation- and environmental-related studies tend to be more mature research whereas the understanding of changes in travel behavior (e.g., telecommuting, preventive measures or health protection behavior) tends to be immature. By using a topic modeling approach, we identify multiple sub-themes within each theme. Our framework adopts a smart literature review approach that can be constantly updated, enabling an analysis of many articles, with little investment of the researcher's time, but also provides high degree of transparency and replicability. We also put forth a research agenda that can help inform and shape transport policy and practice responses to COVID-19. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We examine how the introduction of a technology that automates research tasks influences the rate and type of researchers' knowledge production. To do this, we leverage the unanticipated arrival of an automating motion-sensing research technology that occurred as a consequence of the introduction and subsequent hacking of the Microsoft Kinect system. To estimate whether this technology induces changes in the type of knowledge produced, we employ novel measures based on machine learning (topic modeling) techniques and traditional measures based on bibliometric indicators. Our analysis demonstrates that the shock associated with the introduction of Kinect increased the production of ideas and induced researchers to pursue ideas more diverse than and distant from their original trajectories. We find that this holds for both researchers who had published in motion-sensing research prior to the Kinect shock (within-area researchers) and those who did not (outside-area researchers), with the effects being stronger among outside-area researchers. © 2020 INFORMS.

AB  - The sustainable supply chain (SSC) has received significant attention worldwide in the last few years because it integrates sustainability dimensions into its process. Recent artificial intelligence (AI)-based advancements in technology make it possible to overcome many problems associated with supply chain (SC) networks. The current study was performed to explore the role of AI in establishing an SSC. The research contribution in the field of AI and SSC was examined through a systematic literature review. A total of 353 articles were gathered from the Scopus database in the selected research field. A big data-based approach, namely, structural topic modelling (STM), was applied to generate emerging thematic topics from shortlisted articles of AI in SSC. Moreover, using R package, a bibliometric analysis was conducted to examine the research trends in the field of AI in SSC. The research trends were then analysed, with generated thematic topics discussed. The proposed research framework can help researchers and practitioners to develop an SSC model using AI-based techniques. Propositions for future research are given and implications are suggested. © 2022 The Authors. Business Strategy and The Environment published by ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this work is to survey the body of research revolving around big data (BD) and analytics in hospitality and tourism, by detecting macro topical areas, research streams and gaps and to develop an agenda for future research. Design/methodology/approach: This research is based on a systematic literature review of academic papers indexed in the Scopus and Web of Science databases published up to 31 December 2020. The outputs were analyzed using bibliometric techniques, network analysis and topic modeling. Findings: The number of scientific outputs in research with hospitality and tourism settings has been expanding over the period 2015–2020, with a substantial stability of the areas examined. The vast majority are published in academic journals where the main reference area is neither hospitality nor tourism. The body of research is rather fragmented and studies on relevant aspects, such as BD analytics capabilities, are virtually missing. Most of the outputs are empirical. Moreover, many of the articles collected relatively small quantities of records and, regardless of the time period considered, only a handful of articles mix a number of different techniques. Originality/value: This work sheds new light on the emergence of a body of research at the intersection of hospitality and tourism management and data science. It enriches and complements extant literature reviews on BD and analytics, combining these two interconnected topics. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study aims to identify specific topics, trends, and structural characteristics of scholarly communication research, based on 1,435 articles published from 1970 to 2018 in the Scopus database through Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling, serial analysis, and network analysis. Topic modeling, time series analysis, and network analysis were used to analyze specific topics, trends, and structures, respectively. The results were summarized into three sets as follows. First, the specific topics of scholarly communication research were nineteen in number, including research resource management and research data, and their research proportion is even. Second, as a result of the time series analysis, there are three upward trending topics: Topic 6: Open Access Publishing, Topic 7: Green Open Access, Topic 19: Informal Communication, and two downward trending topics: Topic 11: Researcher Network and Topic 12: Electronic Journal. Third, the network analysis results indicated that high mean profile association topics were related to the institution, and topics with high triangle betweenness centrality, such as Topic 14: Research Resource Management, shared the citation context. Also, through cluster analysis using parallel nearest neighbor clustering, six clusters connected with different concepts were identified. © All JISTaP content is Open Access, meaning it is accessible online to everyone, without fee and authors’ permission.

AB  - The exponential growth of social media has brought with it an increasing propagation of hate speech and hate based propaganda. Hate speech is commonly defined as any communication that disparages a person or a group on the basis of some characteristics such as race, colour, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion. Online hate diffusion has now developed into a serious problem and this has led to a number of international initiatives being proposed, aimed at qualifying the problem and developing effective counter-measures. The aim of this paper is to analyse the knowledge structure of hate speech literature and the evolution of related topics. We apply co-word analysis methods to identify different topics treated in the field. The analysed database was downloaded from Scopus, focusing on a number of publications during the last thirty years. Topic and network analyses of literature showed that the main research topics can be divided into three areas: “general debate hate speech versus freedom of expression”,“hate-speech automatic detection and classification by machine-learning strategies”, and “gendered hate speech and cyberbullying”. The understanding of how research fronts interact led to stress the relevance of machine learning approaches to correctly assess hatred forms of online speech. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: Moving evidence-based practices into the hands of practitioners requires the synthesis and translation of research literature. However, the growing pace of scientific publications across disciplines makes it increasingly difficult to stay abreast of research literature. Natural language processing (NLP) methods are emerging as a valuable strategy for conducting content analyses of academic literature. We sought to apply NLP to identify publication trends in the journal Implementation Science, including key topic clusters and the distribution of topics over time. A parallel study objective was to demonstrate how NLP can be used in research synthesis. Methods: We examined 1711 Implementation Science abstracts published from February 22, 2006, to October 1, 2020. We retrieved the study data using PubMed’s Application Programming Interface (API) to assemble a database. Following standard preprocessing steps, we use topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to cluster the abstracts following a minimization algorithm. Results: We examined 30 topics and computed topic model statistics of quality. Analyses revealed that published articles largely reflect (i) characteristics of research, or (ii) domains of practice. Emergent topic clusters encompassed key terms both salient and common to implementation science. HIV and stroke represent the most commonly published clinical areas. Systematic reviews have grown in topic prominence and coherence, whereas articles pertaining to knowledge translation (KT) have dropped in prominence since 2013. Articles on HIV and implementation effectiveness have increased in topic exclusivity over time. Discussion: We demonstrated how NLP can be used as a synthesis and translation method to identify trends and topics across a large number of (over 1700) articles. With applicability to a variety of research domains, NLP is a promising approach to accelerate the dissemination and uptake of research literature. For future research in implementation science, we encourage the inclusion of more equity-focused studies to expand the impact of implementation science on disadvantaged communities. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - We used bibliometric methods to examine studies related to women entrepreneurship. Specifically, we focused on understanding the recent trends, the most influential publications and journals, topics on which women entrepreneurship studies are conducted, and deciphering the future direction of women entrepreneurship studies. We used the Scopus database to extract 1,554 documents published from 1982 to 2022 and analyzed the scientific publications per year, the most cited articles, sources of publications, keyword co-occurrence, thematic structure (topic modeling), and bibliographic coupling. We found that the scientific publications related to women entrepreneurship are increasing significantly each year, and the most consistent keyword is “gender.” Citation analysis identified Ahl (2006) as the most cited article, which demonstrates Ahl’s notable influence, as well as the success of the gender turn influenced by feminist theory. Co-word analysis found seven clusters showing the thematic structure of women entrepreneurship research. Bibliographic coupling analysis found four clusters, encompassing various aspects associated with women entrepreneurship. The clusters are “Role of gender in an entrepreneur’s performance,” “Challenges and upcoming issues faced by women entrepreneurs,” “Impact of geographic location on women entrepreneurship,” and “Financial struggles of women entrepreneurs.” Topic modeling using the latent Dirchlet allocation algorithm (LDA) identified seven areas of interest in the women entrepreneurship literature. We conclude with implications and suggestions for future research. © 2022 Slovenian Academy of Management. All rights reserved.

AB  - Natural hazards represent a major threat to cultural heritage. Literature has analyzed this nexus using different approaches depending on their focus. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the core pillars structuring the field, we use a machine-human methodology that combines bibliometric and machine-learning text analysis. We focus on a sample of 565 peer-reviewed documents published between 1988 and 2020. Results prove there is increasing interest in the topic, covering different types of hazards depending on the area of interest and its most frequently associated risks. To enhance the granularity of the analysis we apply machine learning to the publications abstracts and we classify documents based on their core topics. We find that the field is highly diverse and includes conservation, restoration and management of historical sites and cultural heritage. Scholars use sophisticated tools and innovative methodologies to account for this heterogeneity. We highlight the need for stronger interdisciplinarity in the field and we call for further progresses in spatial-explicit analysis. Finally, we point towards more inclusion of humanities in the area to account for the cultural aspects of heritage protection. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: This study aimed to analyze the landscape of publications on bariatric metabolic surgery through machine learning and help experts and scholars from various disciplines better understand bariatric metabolic surgery’s hot topics and trends. Methods: In January 2021, publications indexed in PubMed under the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) term ‘Bariatric Surgery’ from 1946 to 2020 were downloaded. Python was used to extract publication dates, abstracts, and research topics from the metadata of publications for bibliometric evaluation. Descriptive statistical analysis, social network analysis (SNA), and topic modeling with latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) were used to reveal bariatric metabolic surgery publication growth trends, landscape, and research topics. Results: A total of 21,798 records of bariatric metabolic surgery–related literature data were collected from PubMed. The number of publications indexed to bariatric metabolic surgery had expanded rapidly. Obesity Surgery and Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases are currently the most published journals in bariatric metabolic surgery. The bariatric metabolic surgery research mainly included five topics: bariatric surgery intervention, clinical case management, basic research, body contour, and surgical risk study. Conclusion: Despite a rapid increase in bariatric metabolic surgery–related publications, few studies were still on quality of life, psychological status, and long-term follow-up. In addition, basic research has gradually increased, but the mechanism of bariatric metabolic surgery remains to be further studied. It is predicted that the above research fields may become potential hot topics in the future. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Background: Breast cancer remains one of the leading malignancies in women with distinct clinical heterogeneity and intense multidisciplinary cooperation. Remarkable progresses have been made in artificial intelligence (AI). A bibliometric analysis was taken to characterize the current picture of development of AI in breast cancer. Materials and Methods: Search process was performed in the Web of Science Core Collection database with analysis and visualization performed by R software, VOSviewer, CiteSpace and Gephi. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a machine learning based algorithm, was used for analysis of topic terms. Results: A total of 511 publications in the field of AI in breast cancer were retrieved between 2000 to 2021. A total of 103 publications were from USA with 2482 citations, making USA the leading country in the field of AI in breast cancer, followed by China. Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Peking Univ, Sichuan Univ, ScreenPoint Med BV, Lund Univ, Duke Univ, Univ Chicago, Harvard Med Sch and Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr were the leading institutions in the field of AI in breast cancer. AI, breast cancer and classification, mammography were the leading keywords. LDA topic modeling identified top fifty topics relating the AI in breast cancer. A total of five primary clusters were found within the network of fifty topics, including radiology feature, lymph node diagnosis and model, pathological tissue and image, dataset classification and machine learning, gene expression and survival. Conclusions: This research depicted AI studies in breast cancer and presented insightful topic terms with future perspective.  © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: We analyzed the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) to understand leading research institutions, collaborations among institutions, major publication venues, key research concepts, and topics covered by pandemic-related research. Methods: We conducted a descriptive analysis of authors’ institutions and relationships, automatic content extraction of key words and phrases from titles and abstracts, and topic modeling and evolution. Data visualization techniques were applied to present the results of the analysis. Results: We found that leading research institutions on COVID-19 included the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the US National Institutes of Health, and the University of California. Research studies mostly involved collaboration among different institutions at national and international levels. In addition to bioRxiv, major publication venues included journals such as The BMJ, PLOS One, Journal of Virology, and The Lancet. Key research concepts included the coronavirus, acute respiratory impairments, health care, and social distancing. The ten most popular topics were identified through topic modeling and included human metapneumovirus and livestock, clinical outcomes of severe patients, and risk factors for higher mortality rate. Conclusion: Data analytics is a powerful approach for quickly processing and understanding large-scale datasets like CORD-19. This approach could help medical librarians, researchers, and the public understand important characteristics of COVID-19 research and could be applied to the analysis of other large datasets. © 2021, Medical Library Association.

AB  - The Proceedings of the Ecological Society of New Zealand (PESNZ) and its continuation, the New Zealand Journal of Ecology (NZJE), published more than 1250 articles over the 58 years from 1961–2019. Over this period, the emphasis of ecology as a science and the social context in which it is embedded have changed. Here we provide a bibliometric analysis of the history of the PESNZ and the NZJE to assess how the dominant research themes have changed through time, and the extent to which they reflect broader trends in the policy and funding landscapes. The journals’ consistent focus has been on applied ecological issues, especially the effects and control of invasive mammals. However, the most discussed taxa have shifted over time (from deer to brushtail possums to rodents and mustelids). Collaboration has altered dramatically, with few author networks and single-author articles in early issues versus multi-author articles and widespread networks today. Thus, the research published by the Society reflects NZ-specific concerns and broader trends in knowledge production (e.g. the shift to team-based science). We conclude by considering the publications of the NZ Ecological Society through the lens of journals being ‘clubs’ for the social production of shared knowledge. © 2021 New Zealand Ecological Society.

AB  - The concepts of openness and sustainability have both enjoyed an increasing popularity in recent scientific literature. However, research has yet to fully utilize their combination and the potential carried toward developing strategies and policies toward solving complex sustainability issues. The primary objective of this paper is to identify and describe the theoretical connections between sustainability and open innovation. We investigate the structural and statistical aspects of recent open innovation literature in search of signs of sustainability using bibliometric metadata and perform a content analysis of articles relevant to Sustainable Open Innovation. Our findings indicate that despite a lack of institutionalized use of sustainability-related keywords, circa nine per cent of the sample articles materially discuss aspects of sustainability or societal concerns from various perspectives, but also lack a holistic and unified approach. As our primary contribution, we shift the level of inquiry in Sustainable Open Innovation research from an organizational-level toward a multi-level system understanding, situating our findings regarding open and sustainable forms of innovation present in the literature as a framework containing the individual, organizational, city, and regional levels and their interconnections. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - The number of received citations have been used as an indicator of the impact of academic publications. Developing tools to find papers that have the potential to become highly-cited has recently attracted increasing scientific attention. Topics of concern by scholars may change over time in accordance with research trends, resulting in changes in received citations. Author-defined keywords, title and abstract provide valuable information about a research article. This study performs a latent Dirichlet allocation technique to extract topics and keywords from articles; five keyword popularity (KP) features are defined as indicators of emerging trends of articles. Binary classification models are utilized to predict papers that were highly-cited or less highly-cited by a number of supervised learning techniques. We empirically compare KP features of articles with other commonly used journal-related and author-related features proposed in previous studies. The results show that, with KP features, the prediction models are more effective than those with journal and/or author features, especially in the management information system discipline. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: The past decade has seen a substantial rise in the employment of modern data-driven methods to study atopic dermatitis (AD)/eczema. The objective of this study is to summarise the past and future of data-driven AD research, and identify areas in the field that would benefit from the application of these methods. Methods: We retrieved the publications that applied multivariate statistics (MS), artificial intelligence (AI, including machine learning-ML), and Bayesian statistics (BS) to AD and eczema research from the SCOPUS database over the last 50 years. We conducted a bibliometric analysis to highlight the publication trends and conceptual knowledge structure of the field, and applied topic modelling to retrieve the key topics in the literature. Results: Five key themes of data-driven research on AD and eczema were identified: (1) allergic co-morbidities, (2) image analysis and classification, (3) disaggregation, (4) quality of life and treatment response, and (5) risk factors and prevalence. ML&AI methods mapped to studies investigating quality of life, prevalence, risk factors, allergic co-morbidities and disaggregation of AD/eczema, but seldom in studies of therapies. MS was employed evenly between the topics, particularly in studies on risk factors and prevalence. BS was focused on three key topics: treatment, risk factors and allergy. The use of AD or eczema terms was not uniform, with studies applying ML&AI methods using the term eczema more often. Within MS, papers using cluster and factor analysis were often only identified with the term AD. In contrast, those using logistic regression and latent class/transition models were “eczema” papers. Conclusions: Research areas that could benefit from the application of data-driven methods include the study of the pathogenesis of the condition and related risk factors, its disaggregation into validated subtypes, and personalised severity management and prognosis. We highlight BS as a new and promising approach in AD and eczema research. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Adaptation and mitigation to the adverse impacts of rising weather and climate extremes require businesses to respond with adequate marketing strategies promoting sustained economic development. Unfortunately, the connections exploring such relationships have not been extensively investigated in the current body of literature. This study investigated the five marketing categories relating to sustainable practices (sustainable marketing, social marketing, green marketing, sustainable consumption and ecological marketing) within core research themes of climate change, global warming and sustainability from a bibliometric approach using the Scopus API. Additional topic modelling was conducted using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) unsupervised approach on downloaded abstracts to distinguish ideas communicated in time through research and publications with co-occurrences of major Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Reports and Google search queries. The results confirmed marketing strategies aligned with the theme of sustainability with little work from small developing island nations. Additionally, findings demonstrated that research exploring business strategies through green marketing directed to green consumers with sustainable supply chain management had been dominantly increasing in the literature over recent years. Similarly, social marketing associated with green consumers was a common concern for the public and academics, rising over the years with strong influence from the published IPCC Assessment Reports. This study did not explore other published databases, including climate change-related meeting transcripts and published speeches from corporate and world leaders. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Digital transformation (DT) is the process of combining digital technologies with sound business models to generate great value for enterprises. DT intertwines with customer requirements, domain knowledge, and theoretical and empirical insights for value propagations. Studies of DT are growing rapidly and heterogeneously, covering the aspects of product design, engineering, production, and life-cycle management due to the fast and market-driven industrial development under Industry 4.0. Our work addresses the challenge of understanding DT trends by presenting a machine learning (ML) approach for topic modeling to review and analyze advanced DT technology research and development. A systematic review process is developed based on the comprehensive DT in manufacturing systems and engineering literature (i.e., 99 articles). Six dominant topics are identified, namely smart factory, sustainability and product-service systems, construction digital transformation, public infrastructure-centric digital transformation, techno-centric digital transformation, and business model-centric digital transformation. The study also contributes to adopting and demonstrating the ML-based topic modeling for intelligent and systematic bibliometric analysis, particularly for unveiling advanced engineering research trends through domain literature. © 2021

AB  - Purpose: The Journal of Intellectual Capital (JIC) celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2020. Therefore, the present study aims to provide a general overview of the history and key trends in this journal during 2000–2019. Design/methodology/approach: Two types of citation and textual data during a 20-year journal period were retrieved from the Scopus database. The citation structures and contents were explored based on a combination of bibliometric analysis, altmetric analysis and text mining. The journal themes and trends of their changes were analyzed through citation bursts, mapping and topic modeling. To make a better comparison, the text mining process for the topic modeling of the IC field was performed in addition to the topic modeling of JIC. Findings: Bibliometric analysis indicated that JIC has experienced a remarkable growth in terms of the number of publications and citations over the last 20 years. The results indicated that JIC plays a significant role among IC researchers. Additionally, a large number of researchers, institutes and countries have made contributions to this journal and cited its research papers. Altmetric analysis showed that JIC has been shared in different social media such as Twitter, Facebook, Wikipedia, Mendeley, Citeulike, news and blogs. Text mining abstract of JIC articles indicated that “measurement,” “financial performance” and “IC reporting” have the relative prevalence with increasing trends over the past 20 years. In addition, “research trends” and “national and international studies” had a stable trend with low thematic share. Research limitations/implications: The findings have important implications for the JIC editorial team in order to make informed decisions about the further development of JIC as well as for IC researchers and practitioners to make more valuable contributions to the journal. Originality/value: Using bibliometric analysis, altmetric analysis and text mining, this study provided a systematic and comprehensive analysis of JIC. The simultaneous use of these methods provides an interesting, unique and suitable capacity to analyze the journals by considering their various aspects. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Electronic health records (EHRs)-related publications grow rapidly. It is helpful for experts and scholars in various disciplines to better understand the research landscape, hot topics, and trends of EHRs. We collected 13,438 records of EHRs research literature bibliometrics data from the Web of Science. We mainly performed the descriptive statistical analysis, social network analysis, and topic modeling with lda2vec to reveal the publications growth trend, research subjects distribution, and topics of EHRs researches. The EHRs research mainly included four topics: (i) population health, disease risk prediction, and primary care; (ii) technology, ethics, and privacy security; (iii) quality improvement, user acceptance, and engagement; (iv) information systems application and impact. EHRs have gone through the establishment, utilization, and high-level development and appli-cation. Research topics emerging in recent years have primarily focused on the social determinants of health, the application of deep learning models, the development and utilization of the patient portal, the mining of explicit and tacit knowledge, and the provision of decision support. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Introduction: This study aimed to investigate the landscape of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 research during the last 22 years using machine learning and text analysis. Method: In December 2021, all publications indexed under the MeSH term “Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1” were obtained from PubMed. The whole set of search results was downloaded in XML format, and metadata such as title, abstract, keywords, mesh words, and year of publication were extracted from the original XML files for bibliometric evaluation. The Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling method was used to analyze specific themes. Results: This study eventually contained 1,407 publications. Among them, there are 768 (54.58%) case reports and reviews. Text analysis based on MeSH words revealed that the most often studied clinical areas include therapy efficacy, prognosis, and genetic diagnosis. The majority of basic study is focused on genetic alterations. The LDA topic model further identifies three topic clusters include basic research, treatment cluster, and diagnosis cluster. In the basic research cluster, many studies are focused on the expression of Menin. The primary focus of the therapy cluster is pancreatic resections and parathyroidectomy. In the diagnose cluster, the main focus is on Genetic Diagnosis and screening strategies for Hereditary Cancer Syndrome. Conclusion: The current state of research on MEN1 is far from adequate. Research on rare diseases MEN1 necessitates implementing a broad research program involving multiple centers to advance MEN1 research together. Copyright © 2022 Feng, Chen, Huang, Feng and Chang.

AB  - Topic extraction is an essential task in bibliometric data analysis, data mining and knowledge discovery, which seeks to identify significant topics from text collections. The conventional topic extraction schemes require human intervention and involve also comprehensive pre-processing tasks to represent text collections in an appropriate way. In this paper, we present a two-stage framework for topic extraction from scientific literature. The presented scheme employs a two-staged procedure, where word embedding schemes have been utilized in conjunction with cluster analysis. To extract significant topics from text collections, we propose an improved word embedding scheme, which incorporates word vectors obtained by word2vec, POS2vec, word-position2vec and LDA2vec schemes. In the clustering phase, an improved clustering ensemble framework, which incorporates conventional clustering methods (i.e., k-means, k-modes, k-means++, self-organizing maps and DIANA algorithm) by means of the iterative voting consensus, has been presented. In the empirical analysis, we analyze a corpus containing 160,424 abstracts of articles from various disciplines, including agricultural engineering, economics, engineering and computer science. In the experimental analysis, performance of the proposed scheme has been compared to conventional baseline clustering methods (such as, k-means, k-modes, and k-means++), LDA-based topic modelling and conventional word embedding schemes. The empirical analysis reveals that ensemble word embedding scheme yields better predictive performance compared to the baseline word vectors for topic extraction. Ensemble clustering framework outperforms the baseline clustering methods. The results obtained by the proposed framework show an improvement in Jaccard coefficient, Folkes Mallows measure and F1 score. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic outbreak across the globe has disrupted human life and industry. The pandemic has affected every sector, with the real estate sector facing particular challenges. During the pandemic, property management became a crucial task and property managers were challenged to control risks and disruptions faced by their organizations. Recent innovative technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), have supported many sectors through sudden disruptions; this study was performed to examine the role of AI in the real estate and property management (PM) sectors. For this purpose, a systematic literature review was conducted using structural topic modeling and bibliometric analysis. Using appropriate keywords, the researchers found 175 articles on AI and PM research from 1980 to 2021 in the SCOPUS database. A bibliometric analysis was performed to identify research trends. Structural topic modelling (STM) identified ten emerging thematic topics in AI and PM. A comprehensive framework is proposed, and future research directions discussed. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Over the past five years, topic models have been applied to bibliometrics research as an efficient tool for discovering latent and potentially useful content. The combination of topic modeling algorithms and bibliometrics has generated new challenges of interpreting and understanding the outcome of topic modeling. Motivated by these new challenges, this paper proposes a systematic methodology for topic analysis in scientific literature corpora to face the concerns of conducting post topic modeling analysis. By linking the corpus metadata with the discovered topics, we feature them with a number of topic-based analytic indices to explore their significance, developing trend, and received attention. A topic relation identification approach is then presented to quantitatively model the relations among the topics. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our methodology, we present two case studies, using big data and dye-sensitized solar cell publications derived from searches in World of Science. Possible application of the methodology in telling good stories of a target corpus is also explored to facilitate further research management and opportunity discovery. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

AB  - Publication of research outputs is a method of researchers to capture their knowledge generated. Analysing the publication topics and trends in a research field can provide insight into the main research trends. A bibliometric analysis, based on the topics from published literature, provides insight into the focus areas and trends of a research field. The objective of this paper is to extract the main research topics from papers on ‘sustainable development’ and ‘information communication technology’. The research topics are extracted from the abstracts and titles of papers using machine-learning for topic modelling. This paper identified the topics of knowledge management, design process, social change, and smart systems, as the primary focus of research into information communication technology for sustainable development. A deeper analysis into smart systems identified quality of citizen life, solutions for the urban setting, energy, and the environment as key research concerns.

AB  - Numerous research studies are conducted annually, and many researchers look for them in the scientific databases. In order to manage the research ecosystem, it is necessary to have sufficient knowledge about the research supply and demand. This study proposes a novel expert-independent framework to investigate the research supply and demand among the huge number of studies. In this framework, the combination of quantitative, bibliographic, and content analysis methods is applied via text mining techniques. To evaluate the proposed framework, environmental data from the Iran scientific information database is used (Ganj)1 as a rich database. It includes more than 513,000 supplied records and more than 78 million search queries as the research demands. To analyze the research supply and demand, the research topics are extracted via the topic modeling approach from both the supply and demand side. The results showed that the educational category of environmental studies is moved from medical science to engineering in the last decades. Moreover, the gap analysis between research supply and demand identified 'Extraction' and 'Tourism' as hot topics, 'Education,' 'Management,' and 'Culture' as cold topics, 'Soil' and 'Energy' as silent topics and finally, 'International Rights' and 'River' as gap topics. The findings can support environmental policymakers and research managers in making decisions and identifying environmental research needs and priorities. The proposed framework for other research areas can be used to examine and balance research supply and demand. © 1973-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Topic modelling is a powerful text mining tool that has been applied in many fields such as software engineering, political and linguistic sciences. To evaluate the development of topic modelling studies, the present study reports a bibliometric analysis of SCIE, SSCI and A&HCI listed articles published from 2000 and 2017. Bibliometric indices for productive authors, countries and institutions are analysed. In addition, thematic changes concerning topic modelling are also examined. Results show that China plays a leading role in this field. Topic modelling has established itself as an important technique in not only natural and formal sciences but also social sciences. LDA, social networks and text analysis are the topics with increasing popularity, while certain models (e.g. pLSA) and applications (e.g. topic detection) are declining in popularity. The findings could help researchers optimise research topic choices, seek collaboration with appropriate partners and stay up-to-date with the development of the field. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to discern emerging trends and provide a longitudinal perspective on merchandising research by identifying relationships between merchandising-related subdomains/themes. Design/methodology/approach: This study sourced 657 merchandising-related articles published since 1960, from the Scopus database and 425 from Web of Science. After processing and normalizing the data, this study performed co-word and thematic network analyses. Taking a text mining approach, this study used topic modeling to identify a set of coherent topics characterized by the keywords of the articles. Findings: This study identified the following merchandising-related themes: branding, retail, consumer, behavior, modeling, textile and clothing industry and visual merchandising. Although visual merchandising was the first type of merchandising to be used in-store, only recently has it become an emerging topic in the academic literature. There has been a further trend over the past decade to understand the adoption of simulation technology, such as computer-aided design, particularly in supply chain management in the clothing industry. These and other findings contribute to the discussion of the merchandising concept, approached from an evolutionary perspective. Research limitations/implications: The conclusions of this study hold implications at the intersection of merchandising, sectors, new technologies, research methodologies and merchandising-practitioner education. Research trends suggest that, in the future, virtual reality and augmented reality using neuroscientific methods will be applied to the e-merchandising context. Practical implications: The different dimensions of merchandising can be used to leverage store managers’ decision-making process toward an integrated store-management strategy. In particular, by adopting loyalty merchandising tactics, the store can generate emotional attachment among consumers, who will perceive its value and services as unique, thanks to merchandising items designed specifically with that aim in mind. The stimulation of unplanned purchases, the strategic location of products and duration of each merchandising activity in the store, the digitalization of merchandising and the application of findings from neuroscience studies are some of the most relevant practical applications. Originality/value: This study provides the first-ever longitudinal review of the state of the art in merchandising research, taking a holistic perspective of this field of knowledge spanning a 60-year period. The work makes a valuable contribution to the development of the marketing discipline. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Objective: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat to health and healthcare. In response to the growing AMR burden, research funding also increased. However, a comprehensive overview of the research output, including conceptual, temporal, and geographical trends, is missing. Therefore, this study uses topic modelling, a machine learning approach, to reveal the scientific evolution of AMR research and its trends, and provides an interactive user interface for further analyses. Methods: Structural topic modelling (STM) was applied on a text corpus resulting from a PubMed query comprising AMR articles (1999–2018). A topic network was established and topic trends were analysed by frequency, proportion, and importance over time and space. Results: In total, 88 topics were identified in 158,616 articles from 166 countries. AMR publications increased by 450% between 1999 and 2018, emphasizing the vibrancy of the field. Prominent topics in 2018 were Strategies for emerging resistances and diseases, Nanoparticles, and Stewardship. Emerging topics included Water and environment, and Sequencing. Geographical trends showed prominence of Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in the WHO African Region, corresponding with the MDR-TB burden. China and India were growing contributors in recent years, following the United States of America as overall lead contributor. Conclusion: This study provides a comprehensive overview of the AMR research output thereby revealing the AMR research response to the increased AMR burden. Both the results and the publicly available interactive database serve as a base to inform and optimise future research. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - E-learning has gained further importance and the amount of e-learning research and applications has increased exponentially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it is critical to examine trends and interests in e-learning research and applications during the pandemic period. This paper aims to identify trends and research interests in e-learning articles related to COVID-19 pandemic. Consistent with this aim, a semantic content analysis was conducted on 3562 peer-reviewed journal articles published since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, using the N-gram model and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling approach. Findings of the study revealed the high-frequency bigrams such as 'online learn', 'online education', 'online teach' and 'distance learn', as well as trigrams such as 'higher education institution', 'emergency remote teach', 'education online learn' and 'online teach learn'. Moreover, the LDA topic modeling analysis revealed 42 topics. The topics of 'Learning Needs', 'Higher Education' and 'Social Impact' respectively were the most focused topics. These topics also revealed concepts, dimensions, methods, tools, technologies, applications, measurement and evaluation models, which are the focal points of e-learning field during the pandemic. The findings of the study are expected to provide insights to researchers and future studies.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The increasing concern of climate change and unstable oil prices induce the development of technological fuel in automobile industry. To investigate such a rapidly changing path, researchers apply bibliometrics and topic modeling to patent data. These commonly used methods, however, have several drawbacks such as considering macro-level trend only and focusing on high probable terms. To avoid these weaknesses, we propose the two-layer trend analysis based on Time country topic model (TCT) and Dirichlet compound multinomial model (DCM) that enable to detect both macro-level and micro-level trend and identify bursty terms in automotive industry. Experimental results show rising, falling and fluctuating trend topics on condition of countries using TCT model. We also find path of automotive technology based on bursty terms from the analysis of DCM model. Specifically, electric vehicle, aluminum in lightweight material and diesel engine are considered as rising topics in the automobile fuel. Our proposed framework can be applied to analyze the trajectory analysis in various other fields. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - The landscape of software engineering research has changed significantly from one year to the next in line with industrial needs and trends. Therefore, today's research literature on software engineering has a rich and multidisciplinary content that includes a large number of studies; however, not many of them demonstrate a holistic view of the field. From this perspective, this study aimed to reveal a holistic view that reflects topics, trends, and trajectories in software engineering research by analyzing the majority of domain-specific articles published over the last 40 years. This study first presents an objective and systematic method for corpus creation through major publication sources in the field. A corpus was then created using this method, which includes 44 domain-specific conferences and journals and 57,174 articles published between 1980 and 2019. Next, this corpus was analyzed using an automated text-mining methodology based on a probabilistic topic-modeling approach. As a result of this analysis, 24 main topics were found. In addition, topical trends in the field were revealed. Finally, three main developmental stages of the field were identified as: the programming age, the software development age, and the software optimization age.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Cancer immunotherapy is a rapidly growing field that is completely transforming oncology care. Mining this knowledge base for biomedically important information is becoming increasingly challenging, due to the expanding number of scientific publications, and the dynamic evolution of this subject with time. In this study, we have employed a literature-mining approach that was used to analyze the cancer immunotherapy-related publications listed in PubMed and quantify emerging trends. A total of 93,033 publications published in 5055 journals have been retrieved, and 141 meaningful topics have been identified, which were further classified into eight distinct categories. Statistical analysis indicates a mean annual increase in the number of published papers of approximately 8% in the last 20 years. The research topics that exhibited the highest trends included “immune checkpoint inhibitors,” “tumor microenvironment,” “HPV vaccination,” “CAR T-cells,” and “gene mutations/tumor profiling.” The top identified cancer types included “lung,” “colorectal,” and “breast cancer,” and a shift in popularity from hematological to solid tumors was observed. As regards clinical research, a transition from early phase clinical trials to randomized control trials was recorded, indicating that the field is entering a more advanced phase of development. Overall, this mining approach provided an unbiased analysis of the cancer immunotherapy literature in a time-conserving and scale-efficient manner. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study analyzed 928 full-text research articles retrieved from DESIDOC Journal of Library and Information Technology for the period of 1981–2018 using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The study further tagged the articles with the modeled topics. 50 core topics were identified throughout the period of 38 years whereas only 26 topics were unique in nature. Bibliometrics, ICT, information retrieval, and user studies were highly researched areas in India for the epoch. Further, Spain and Taiwan showed common research trends and areas as India whereas India has quite distinct research interests from America and China. Therefore, researchers in Library and Information Science in India should pay more attention to the topics which are under-researched. Further, it was found that there were some unique sub-fields to Indian Library and Information Science research, such as open access; online exhibition; virtual libraries; multimedia libraries; open source software; library automation; and library management system. With the passage of time topics evolve over time, new topics emerge, and old ones become obsolete. Topic modeling not only helps the researcher to determine the trending themes or related fields with respect to their field of interest but also helps them to identify new concepts and fields over time. © 2019, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Geospatial data is an indispensable data resource for research and applications in many fields. The technologies and applications related to geospatial data are constantly advancing and updating, so identifying the technologies and applications among them will help foster and fund fur-ther innovation. Through topic analysis, new research hotspots can be discovered by understanding the whole development process of a topic. At present, the main methods to determine topics are peer review and bibliometrics, however they just review relevant literature or perform simple frequency analysis. This paper proposes a new topic discovery method, which combines a word embedding method, based on a pre-trained model, Bert, and a spherical k-means clustering algorithm, and ap-plies the similarity between literature and topics to assign literature to different topics. The proposed method was applied to 266 pieces of literature related to geospatial data over the past five years. First, according to the number of publications, the trend analysis of technologies and applications related to geospatial data in several leading countries was conducted. Then, the consistency of the proposed method and the existing method PLSA (Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis) was evaluated by using two similar consistency evaluation indicators (i.e., U-Mass and NMPI). The results show that the method proposed in this paper can well reveal text content, determine development trends, and produce more coherent topics, and that the overall performance of Bert-LSA is better than PLSA using NPMI and U-Mass. This method is not limited to trend analysis using the data in this paper; it can also be used for the topic analysis of other types of texts. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - We examine the literature on the financial economics of precious metals from a bibliometric and scientometric perspective. We surface the main trends and authors in the area over the last two decades, and provide estimates of the density of the networks of both researchers and research. Clear evidence is provided of an area dominated by a number of high output researchers, with distinct and clear areas of research with little overlap. A probabilistic topic modelling approach is further applied to determine the main topics of research in the area. We conclude that there are significant areas of potential synergy as yet unexploited in this research domain. We also highlight the current topics that can be a particularly important focus for these synergy efforts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: Multiple disciplines such as finance, management and economics have contributed to governance research over time. However, the full intellectual structure of the governance “field” including the exchange of knowledge across disciplines and the large variety of governance topics remains to be uncovered. To appreciate the breadth of corporate governance research, it is necessary to understand the disciplinary sources from which the research stems. This manuscript focuses on the interdisciplinary underpinnings of corporate governance research. Design/methodology/approach: This paper employs bibliometric analysis to trace the evolution of corporate governance using articles included in the ISI Web of Science database between 1990 and 2015. Journals included in these categories encompass a full range of business disciplines and provide evidence of the multi-disciplinary nature of corporate governance. It also uncovers the topics treated by disciplines under the governance umbrella using a machine learning method called latent Dirichtlet allocation (LDA). Findings: Corporate governance research deals with a number of strategy-related topics. Unlike strategy topics that reside in a single discipline, corporate governance crosses disciplinary boundaries and includes contributions from accounting, finance, economics, law and management. Our analysis shows that over 80% of corporate governance articles come from outside the field of management. Our LDA solution indicates that the major topics in governance research include corporate governance theory, control of family firms, executive compensation and audit committees. Originality/value: The results illustrate that corporate governance is far more interdisciplinary than previously thought. This is an important insight for corporate governance academics and may lead to collaborative research. More importantly, this research illustrates the usefulness of LDA for investigating interdisciplinary fields. This method is easily transferable to other interdisciplinary fields and it provides a powerful alternative to existing bibliometric methods. We suggest a number of topic areas within library and information science where this method may be applied, including collection development, support for interdisciplinary faculty and basic research into emerging interdisciplinary areas. © 2020, Jeffrey D.

AB  - Investor attention is an emergent area in financial scholarship. However, no review till date offers a comprehensive retrospection of this research domain. To address this gap, we present an overview of investor-attention research in finance. Using both co-citation and structural topic modelling analyses, we infer the knowledge and thematic structure of investor-attention research for 1994–2021. By uncovering four co-citation clusters and eight specific topics, we conclude that investor-attention research in the areas of “underreaction to earnings announcements”, “sector and financial risk”, and “investors' attention and firm disclosures” is likely to soon expand rapidly. Our survey also identifies the most prominent scholars, author affiliations, and scientific outlets publishing on investor-attention research topics. We also explore the various theories examined or discussed in investor-attention scholarship, as well as identify research gaps. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Blockchain has become one of the core technologies in Industry 4.0. To help decision-makers establish action plans based on blockchain, it is an urgent task to analyze trends in blockchain technology. However, most of existing studies on blockchain trend analysis are based on effort demanding full-text investigation or traditional bibliometric methods whose study scope is limited to a frequency-based statistical analysis. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new topic modeling method called Word2vec-based Latent Semantic Analysis (W2V-LSA), which is based on Word2vec and Spherical k-means clustering to better capture and represent the context of a corpus. We then used W2V-LSA to perform an annual trend analysis of blockchain research by country and time for 231 abstracts of blockchain-related papers published over the past five years. The performance of the proposed algorithm was compared to Probabilistic LSA, one of the common topic modeling techniques. The experimental results confirmed the usefulness of W2V-LSA in terms of the accuracy and diversity of topics by quantitative and qualitative evaluation. The proposed method can be a competitive alternative for better topic modeling to provide direction for future research in technology trend analysis and it is applicable to various expert systems related to text mining. © 2020

AB  - Introduction: The purpose of this study was to assess the landscape of parathyroid carcinoma research during the last 22 years using machine learning and text analysis. Method: In November 2021, we obtained from PubMed all works indexed under the mesh subject line “parathyroid carcinoma”. The entire set of search results was retrieved in XML format, and metadata such as title, abstract, keywords, mesh words, and year of publication were extracted for bibliometric evaluation from the original XML files. To increase the specificity of the investigation, the Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling method was applied. Results: The paper analyzed 3578 papers. The volume of literature related to parathyroid cancer has been relatively flat over the past 22 years. In the field of parathyroid cancer research, the most important topic of clinical interest is the differential diagnosis. Ultrasound and MIBI are the most commonly used imaging methods for localization. In terms of basic research, the mechanisms of gene mutation and local tumor recurrence are the focus of interest. Conclusion: There are huge unmet research needs for parathyroid carcinoma. Improving the diagnosis rates of parathyroid cancer by clinicians and establishing new and reliable molecular pathological markers and new image localization techniques will continue to be the focus of future research.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between gender diversity and research outcomes. Existing research on the topic primarily focuses on how team gender diversity influences scholarly productivity in terms of citations and publication rates. Far less attention has been devoted to the question of how the intellectual contents of research disciplines change as they become more gender diverse. Drawing on a global sample of more than 25,000 management papers, we use natural language processing techniques, correspondence analysis and regression models to illuminate impact-, content- and status-related dimensions of gender diversity in management research. In regression models adjusting for geographical setting, institutional prestige and collaboration patterns, we find no discernable effects of team gender diversity on per-paper scientific impact. In contrast, our analyses converge to yield a broadly consistent pattern of gender-related variations in research focus: women are well-represented in social- and human-centered areas of management, while men comprise the vast majority in areas addressing more technical and operational aspects. Our findings corroborate recent sociological research suggesting that cultural norms and expectations are channeling women and men towards different areas of work and study. We argue that the broadened repertoire of perspectives, values and questions resulting from gender diversity may render management research more responsive to the full gamut of societal needs and expectations. © 2019

AB  - Despite the growing importance of eating disorders in society and academic literature, only a few bibliometric review studies using bibliometric analysis were available. Hence, this study aimed to explore and uncover hidden research topics and patterns in articles in terms of eating disorders over the last 30 years. In total, 4111 articles on eating disorders were analyzed using bibliometrics, network analyses, and structural topic modeling as the basis of mixed methods. In addition to general statistics about the journal, several key research topics, such as eating disorder (ED) treatment, ED symptoms, factors triggering ED, family related factors, eating behaviors, and social factors, were found based on topic correlations. This study found the key research variables that are frequently studied with EDs, such as AN, BN, BED, and ARFID. This study may help clinicians comprehend important risk factors associated with EDs. Moreover, the findings about key ED research topics and their association can be helpful for future studies to construct a comprehensive ED research framework. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use topic modeling in an academic journal on EDs and examine the diversity in ED research over 30 years of published research. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Topic modeling methods have usually been applied in the past to identify the research interests of researchers. Observing the scientific growth, the trending topics can be identified as Stable, Hot, or Cold. Finding rising stars (junior researchers, who are at the start of their career) from a bibliometric network is a challenging task, specifically if the researchers have an interest in multiple sub-domains or are working on diverse topics. Existing methods for finding rising stars explore the co-author networks or citation networks, and ignore the textual content, which may help in finding rising stars through hot topics detection over time. A publication contributing to a hot topic can be an indication that the author of that publication may be a rising star and can become an expert in that domain in the future. This study proposes the Hot Topics Rising Star Rank (HTRS-Rank) method for finding rising stars by detecting hot topics. HTRS-Rank finds the junior scholars, who contribute to hot topics at the start of their career and ranks them based on the presence of hot topics in their publications. AMiner five years dataset ranging from 2005–2009 is selected for experimentation. Top 10 researchers are considered to measure the association strength using rank correlation among HTRS-Rank and baseline methods. Experimental results show the efficiency of HTRS-Rank in comparison to the baseline methods. The proposed HTRS Rank (TF–IDF) provides low standard deviation for productivity, citations and sociality as compared to baseline methods for more social and highly cited authors. It is identified that HTRS-Rank (WordNet) emphasizes the semantic similarity of two sentences, whereas HTRS-Rank (TF–IDF) scheme emphasizes the uniqueness or importance of each term, therefore TF–IDF approach performs better than WordNet approach due to having higher correlation with StarRank and WMIRank. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This manuscript explores the research topics and collaborative behaviour of authors in the field of the Prisoner’s Dilemma using topic modeling and a graph theoretic analysis of the co-authorship network. The analysis identified five research topics in the Prisoner’s Dilemma which have been relevant over the course of time. These are human subject research, biological studies, strategies, evolutionary dynamics on networks and modeling problems as a Prisoner’s Dilemma game. Moreover, the results demonstrated the Prisoner’s Dilemma is a field of continued interest, and that it is a collaborative field compared to other game theoretic fields. The co-authorship network suggests that authors are focused on their communities and that not many connections across the communities are made. The most central authors of the network are the authors connected to the main cluster. Through examining the networks of topics, it was uncovered that the main cluster is characterised by the collaboration of authors in a single topic. These findings add to the bibliometrics study in another field and present new questions and avenues of research to understand the reasons for the measured behaviours. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Interactive Learning Environments (ILE) is an important and active international journal in the research field of interactive learning environments since 1990. Focusing on the major contributors, scientific collaborations, research topics and topic evolution, this paper analyses 784 ILE articles using topic modelling and bibliometrics to explore key milestones in ILE's history. Institutions from the USA and Taiwan have contributed the most to the community, as witnessed from their top ranks in both impact and productivity indicators. Scientific collaborations between institutions in the same regions are noteworthy, while cross-regional collaborations need to be enhanced. Diverse applications and technologies such as intelligent tutoring systems, concept maps, digital games, e-books, interactive response systems, digital storytelling and augmented reality are increasingly integrated into interactive learning contexts to facilitate flipped learning, personalised learning and project-based learning. Additionally, learners' emotions, cognitive load and acceptance of technologies are widely studied. Copyright © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Scientific commentaries are expected to play an important role in evidence appraisal, but it is unknown whether this expectation has been fulfilled. This study aims to better understand the role of scientific commentary in evidence appraisal. We queried PubMed for all clinical research articles with accompanying comments and extracted corresponding metadata. Five percent of clinical research studies (N = 130 629) received postpublication comments (N = 171 556), resulting in 178 882 comment-article pairings, with 90% published in the same journal. We obtained 5197 full-text comments for topic modeling and exploratory sentiment analysis. Topics were generally disease specific with only a few topics relevant to the appraisal of studies, which were highly prevalent in letters. Of a random sample of 518 full-text comments, 67% had a supportive tone. Based on our results, published commentary, with the exception of letters, most often highlight or endorse previous publications rather than serve as a prominent mechanism for critical appraisal. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Introduction: eHealth emerged as an interdisciplinary research area about 70 years ago. This study employs probabilistic techniques to semantically analyse scientific literature related to the field of eHealth in order to identify topics and trends and discuss their comparative evolution. Methods: Authors collected titles and abstracts of published literature on eHealth as indexed in PubMed. Basic statistical and bibliometric techniques were applied to overall describe the collected corpus; Latent Dirichlet Allocation was employed for unsupervised topics identification; topics trends analysis was performed, and correlation graphs were plotted were relevant. Results: A total of 30,425 records on eHealth were retrieved from PubMed (all records till 31 December 2017, search on 8 May 2018) and 23,988 of these were included to the study corpus. eHealth domain shows a growth higher than the growth of the entire PubMed corpus, with a mean increase of eHealth corpus proportion of about 7% per year for the last 20 years. Probabilistic topics modelling identified 100 meaningful topics, which were organised by the authors in nine different categories: general; service model; disease; medical specialty; behaviour and lifestyle; education; technology; evaluation; and regulatory issues. Discussion: Trends analysis shows a continuous shift in focus. Early emphasis on medical image transmission and system integration has been replaced by increased focus on standards, wearables and sensor devices, now giving way to mobile applications, social media and data analytics. Attention on disease is also shifting, from initial popularity of surgery, trauma and acute heart disease, to the emergence of chronic disease support, and the recent attention to cancer, infectious disease, mental disorders, paediatrics and perinatal care; most interestingly the current swift increase is in research related to lifestyle and behaviour change. The steady growth of all topics related to assessment and various systematic evaluation techniques indicates a maturing research field that moves towards real world application. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Selecting the appropriate academic journal is a priority issue for researchers in the process of publishing a manuscript. If researchers could quantify the research topic in terms of its fit with the journal requirements before the submission of a paper, then the assessment of journal suitability could be much easier. Basing any decision on journal impact factors alone might obviously result in a mismatch, eventual rejection and a consequent loss of time. Taking the twelve leading Tourism and Hospitality journals as a reference, the main research topics mentioned in the abstracts of 20,381 articles are identified, using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm and other text-mining techniques running the R programming language. Subsequently, a quantitative measure of the fit of the research topics in each journal is offered according to their frequency of occurrence. The results suggested that the importance of the topic-journal fit with respect to the impact factor depended on the variance of the fits among the journals. Finally, a guide of the most suitable journals for the topics is presented, based on the JCR impact factor and the fit of the topic. Some recommendations are likewise offered on the use of this methodology and its limitations. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - In this work we present an extensive bibliometric and content-based analysis of the scientific literature about genetic programming in the twenty-first century. Our work has two key peculiarities. First, we revealed the topics emerging from the literature based on an unsupervised analysis of the textual content of titles and abstracts. Second, we executed all of our analyses twice, once on the papers published in the venues that are typical of the evolutionary computation research community and once on those published in all the other venues. This view from “both sides of the fence” allows us to gain broader and deeper insights into the actual contributions of our community. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Over the past two decades, the scientific study of marine biodiversity developed into one of the most dynamic research fields within environmental research in general and ocean science in particular. Marine biodiversity research spans a broad range of spatial and temporal scales, scientific disciplines, and infrastructures for assessing patterns of change in marine biodiversity with different topics and regions contributing to the abstract construction of the field. Yet, beneath the surface of these abstract constructions and attributions such as “big science” to assess the international, interdisciplinary and data-driven nature marine biodiversity research, patterns of scientific collaboration emerge that shape the contributions of different world regions to the field. Furthermore, legal, political and territorial orders shape scientific collaboration by determining access to the marine environment and the study thereof. To understand these dynamics, this study analyses scientific publications on marine biodiversity using topic modeling methodology. Our approach provides the opportunity not only to describe large clusters within the field of marine biodiversity, but also to show how these topical clusters differ in time and across regions. By looking at the temporal and regional level, we wish to contribute to a deeper understanding of collaboration and regional specificity in the emergence of new research fields and – what we call – “selective world-building” across time and space. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Collaborations between industry and academia provide a key pathway for innovation and serve as a stimulus for basic and applied research. The collaborative innovations of the two communities are embedded in both the collaborative networks of these organizations and the knowledge networks established by coupling among knowledge elements in the collaborative content. However, existing studies on academic-industrial collaborations have mainly been concerned with analyzing these interactions at the institutional level. To fill the gap of profiling collaborative content and to inspire related studies, this paper provides a bibliometric-enhanced method of mapping topic networks and measuring the semantic structures of academic-industrial collaboration. Via this method, topics can be extracted, vectorized, and correlated to construct a bibliometric-enhanced topic network as a representation of the collaborative content generated by these partnerships. Examining the structural properties of the topic network can provide comprehensive insights for future academic-industrial research collaborations. To showcase these insights, we conducted a case study involving both articles and patents in the field of digitalization. As the case study shows, the method provided in this paper can serve as a tool for cooperative research planning, innovation management, and problem-solving in a given target area of research. © 2021

AB  - Knowledge graph as a research topic is increasingly popular to represent structural relations between entities. Recent years have witnessed the release of various open-source and enterprise-supported knowledge graphs with dramatic growth in applying knowledge representation and reasoning into different areas like natural language processing and computer vision. This study aims to comprehensively explore the status and trends – particularly the thematic research structure – of knowledge graphs. Specifically, based on 386 research articles published from 1991 to 2020, we conducted analyses in terms of the (1) visualization of the trends of annual article and citation counts, (2) recognition of major institutions, countries/regions, and publication sources, (3) visualization of scientific collaborations of major institutions and countries/regions, and (4) detection of major research themes and their developmental tendencies. Interest in knowledge graph research has clearly increased from 1991 to 2020 and is continually expanding. China is the most prolific country in knowledge graph research. Moreover, countries/regions and institutions that have higher levels of international collaboration are more impactful. Several widely studied issues such as knowledge graph embedding, search and query based on knowledge graphs, and knowledge graphs for intangible cultural heritage are highlighted. Based on the results, we further summarize perspective directions and suggestions for researchers, practitioners, and project managers to facilitate future research on knowledge graphs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The world is moving into a situation where resource scarcity leads to an increase in material cost. A possible way to deal with the above challenge is to adopt Circular Economy (CE) concepts to make a close loop of material by eliminating industrial or post-consumer wastes. Integration of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning, and big data analytics provides significant support in successfully adopting and implementing CE practices. This study aims to explore the applications of AI techniques in enhancing the adoption and implementation of CE practices. A systematic literature review was performed to analyze the existing scenario and the potential research directions of AI in CE. A collection of 220 articles was shortlisted from the SCOPUS database in the field of AI in CE. A text mining approach, known as Structural Topic Modeling (STM), was used to generate different thematic topics of AI applications in CE. Each generated topic was then discussed with shortlisted articles. Further, a bibliometric study was performed to analyze the research trends in the field of AI applications in CE. A research framework was proposed for AI in CE based on the review conducted, which could help industrial practitioners, and researchers working in this domain. Further, future research propositions on AI in CE were proposed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study attempts to identify research trends in doctoral-level library and information science research in India. The study uses topic modelling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation to identify research trends by collecting relevant sections from the full-text of theses awarded in the last ten years by Indian universities in the discipline of library and information science. The topic modelling results show that the entire corpus can be classified into ten topics, including information communication technology and its application in libraries. The topic-wise trends indicate that ‘ICT and its application in libraries’ are still the prime themes of choice among doctoral-level research in Indian LIS schools, followed by studies on ‘Information seeking behaviour’. The growth-wise trend analysis suggests the decline in the interest in ‘Bibliometrics/Scientometrics’ and ‘Webometrics/Website evaluation studies’. The findings of the study will be of help to academics studying the development of LIS research, as well as aspiring doctoral-level scholars who are to identify a topic for their research work. © 2022, National Institute of Science Communication and Policy Research.

AB  - The fast growth of social robotics (SR) has not been unidirectional, but rather towards a multidisciplinary scenario, creating a need for collaboration between different fields. This divergent expansion calls for a clear analysis of the field aimed at better orienting the research, thus paving the future of social robotics. This paper aims at understanding how the SR research field evolved in the last two decades by analyzing academic publications in SR and human–robot interaction using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The analysis spotted an overlap between SR and human–robot interaction research fields that have been disambiguated using a data-driven approach that leads to the identification of a new group of papers we clustered under the concept of “soft HRI.” This research topic has been analyzed by extracting trends and insights. Finally, another topic modelling step has been applied to identify seven sub-topics that have been discussed and analyzed picturing the current state of the art of SR. The paper reports a complete overview of the SR research field identifying various topics and sub-topics helping researchers in understanding the evolution of this field, thus supporting the strategic placing and evolution of their research activities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Great progress in microbiota research during last decades resulted in a growing corpus of publications mentioning the term 'microbiota'. Specifically, the human microbiota increasingly recognised nowadays as one of the most important health challenges is becoming an emerging research front. By examining over 28 000 microbiota-related papers from the Web of Science database, our study aims to characterise the evolution of publication patterns in this field between 1999 and 2017. The corpus is first analysed in terms of breakdown by journal subject categories, then an additional insight in the structuring of the microbiota research into different topics is provided by means of topic modelling. Our results demonstrate that over time (i) a substantial increase in the publications number is accompanied by a broad diversification of associated journal subject categories; (ii) the research focus moved outside from its primary research field showing successive shifts from dentistry and ecologically centred areas, through agri-food applied topics, towards the most recent clinical applications. The trends in thematic structure of the field presented from a historical perspective suggest that the current systemic approach to host-microbiota relationship inherited from the ecological background of the concept of microbiota has opened up a number of new research directions and perspectives. © 2019 FEMS.

AB  - Background: Taxonomic bias is a known issue within the field of biology, causing scientific knowledge to be unevenly distributed across species. However, a systematic quantification of the research interest that the scientific community has allocated to individual species remains a big data problem. Scalable approaches are needed to integrate biodiversity data sets and bibliometric methods across large numbers of species. The outputs of these analyses are important for identifying understudied species and directing future research to fill these gaps. Findings: In this study, we used the species h-index to quantity the research interest in 7,521 species of mammals. We tested factors potentially driving species h-index, by using a Bayesian phylogenetic generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). We found that a third of the mammals had a species h-index of zero, while a select few had inflated research interest. Further, mammals with higher species h-index had larger body masses; were found in temperate latitudes; had their humans uses documented, including domestication; and were in lower-risk International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List categories. These results surprisingly suggested that critically endangered mammals are understudied. A higher interest in domesticated species suggested that human use is a major driver and focus in mammalian scientific literature. Conclusions: Our study has demonstrated a scalable workflow and systematically identified understudied species of mammals, as well as identified the likely drivers of this taxonomic bias in the literature. This case study can become a benchmark for future research that asks similar biological and meta-research questions for other taxa.  © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Among the next-generation photovoltaics (PVs), hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) have drawn tremendous attention from both academic and industrial communities, because of their compelling combination of high performance, high cost-effectiveness, and broader feasibility. Despite the rapid growth and importance of scientific progress in the PeSC field, there have been no systematic and bibliometric analyses of the PeSC research outputs. In this study, we systemically investigate the scientific publications of the PeSCs with bibliometric routes to map research trends and collaboration status. A total of 6,581 documents published during 2009–2018 are analyzed. For effective investigation, the commercialization factors are categorized by considering levelized cost of electricity and environmental impact; Cost, Efficiency, Stability, Scaling-up, and Public Acceptability. Furthermore, the combined bibliometric methods are employed as follows: statistical analyses of publication outputs, topic modeling based on publication abstracts with time-series and commercialization factors, and social network analysis of co-authorships at institute level. From the analyses of research trends, although the researches on Efficiency takes a large part in all periods, the researches on Scaling-up, Stability, and Public Acceptability have become more active over time. In the analyses of co-authorship network, the level of collaboration in the PeSC research is already globalized, which is led by European, Chinese, and Korean institutes. The comprehensive results not only track the changes in the PeSC field, but also provide useful information on the future direction for the market entry of the PeSCs and the next-generation PVs. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - We provide a comprehensive analysis of the International Review of Financial Analysis (IRFA) between 1992 and 2020 using bibliometrics, regression analysis, and structural topic modeling (STM). Using bibliometric analysis, we find that IRFA's publications and their citations have grown considerably over the years. IRFA also experienced substantial growth in its authors' collaboration network. U.K. and U.S. authors are the journal's most frequent contributors. We use regression analysis to identify article age, a special issue, lead article, European author affiliation, title length and novelty, and the number of authors, figures, keywords, and references as critical predictors of IRFA's citations. Finally, using STM, we find that IRFA's conceptual structure reflects 12 major topics with corporate ownership and governance, and stock market volatility and spillover as the most prominent. The study contributes to the editorial board and other IRFA stakeholders as well as scholars alike. Awareness of IRFA's trends can be pivotal in understanding the patterns in the overall finance domain. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Nowadays, the use of technology in continuously increasing, making a significant impact in almost every area, including education. New areas have gained much popularity in the last years in educational technology (EdTech), such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) or computer-supported collaborative learning. In addition, research and interest in this area have also been growing over the years. The quantity of research and scientific publications in EdTech is constantly increasing, and trying to analyze and extract information from a set of research papers is often a very time-consuming task. To make this process easier and solve these limitations, we present Fontana, a framework that can quickly perform trend and social network analysis using any corpus of documents and its metadata. Specifically, the framework can: 1) Discover the latest trends given any corpus of documents, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) analysis and keywords (bibliometric approach); 2) Discover the evolution of the trends previously identified over the years; 3) Discover the primary authors and papers, along with hidden relationships between existing communities. To test its functionality, we evaluated the framework using a corpus of papers from the EdTech research field. We also followed an open science methodology making the entire framework available in Open Science Framework (OSF) easy to access and use. The case study successfully proved the capabilities of the framework, revealing some of the most frequent topics in the area, such as 'EDM,' 'learning analytics,' or 'collaborative learning.' We expect our work to help identifying trends and patterns in the EdTech area, using natural language processing and social network analysis to objectively process large amounts of research. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been shown to be an effective approach to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections; however, implementation of the service remains challenging. This global bibliometric analysis aims to describe the current trends in HIV research prevention through PrEP to reveal the potential gaps of knowledge and to put forward recommendations for future research. A bibliometric analysis was conducted through Web of Science from 1990 to 2017. Exploratory factor analysis was also employed to find research domains emerging from the abstracts’ contents. Latent Dirichlet allocation, which is a topic modeling algorithm, was utilized to perform text mining and determine relationships among text documents. A total of 4852 papers regarding HIV PrEP research were retrieved. The number of papers and their impact has significantly increased. Preventing sexual transmissions, improving access, and quality of health-care services for current users, as well as men who have sex with men, pregnant women and children, were the research domains most related to PrEP. We found a data gap in research regarding sex workers, potential side effects of PrEP, and misjudgment toward PrEP users. Despite the growth in research about HIV PrEP, there exist barriers to scaling up the implementation of PrEP worldwide and for such intervention to reach its fWull potential. International research collaboration efforts to investigate the potential safety concerns of PrEP and develop strategies to eliminate social misjudgment against PrEP users are warranted. Addressing these knowledge gaps might facilitate the development of effective global implementation strategies for PrEP in the future. (AIDS Rev. (ahead of print)). © Permanyer2020.

AB  - Scientometric methods have long been used to identify technological trajectories, but we have seldom seen reproducible methods that allow for the identification of a technological emergence in a set of documents. This study evaluates the use of three different reproducible approaches for identifying the emergence of technological novelties in scientific publications. The selected approaches are term counting technique, the emergence score (EScore) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We found that the methods provide somewhat distinct perspectives on technological.The term count based method identifies detailed emergence patterns. EScore is a complex bibliometric indicator that provides a holistic view of emergence by considering several parameters, namely term frequency, size, and origin of the research community. LDA traces emergence at the thematic level and provides insights on the linkages between emerging research topics. The results suggest that term counting produces results practical for operational purposes, while LDA offers insight at a strategic level. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Over the past few years, numerous studies and research articles have been published in the medical literature review domain. The topics covered by these researches included medical information retrieval, disease statistics, drug analysis, and many other fields and application domains. In this paper, we employ various text mining and data analysis techniques in an attempt to discover trending topics and topic concordance in the healthcare literature and data mining field. This analysis focuses on healthcare literature and bibliometric data and word association rules applied to 1945 research articles that had been published between the years 2006 and 2019. Our aim in this context is to assist saving time and effort required for manually summarizing large-scale amounts of information in such a broad and multi-disciplinary domain. To carry out this task, we employ topic modeling techniques through the utilization of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), in addition to various document and word embedding and clustering approaches. Findings reveal that since 2010 the interest in the healthcare big data analysis has increased significantly, as demonstrated by the five most commonly used topics in this domain. © 2021

AB  - The combination of new-generation information technology and manufacturing technology has had in a significant and profound impact on the future development paradigm of manufacturing. Machine tools are the basis of virtually everything that is manufactured in the industry, exploring the development of the machine tool domain is of considerable significance to identify the opportunity to develop manufacturing industry and promote the sustainable development of manufacturing in the current tightening constraints of resource environment. Although much attention has been paid to development studies of a specific domain in recent years, it is challenging to conduct a multidimensional study related to the development status of the machine tool domain using existing methods. To solve this challenge, we propose an integrating framework combining topic models, bibliometric, trend analysis and patent analysis to mine multi-source literature within the machine tool domain, including papers, funds, patents, and news. Specifically, papers and funds provided two different perspectives to explore the development status in the research of machine tools. Furthermore, the technology development of machine tools was investigated through patents analysis. Finally, news related to the machine tool industry in recent years was analyzed to examine business focuses on machine tools. The integration of above various analytical methods and multi-dimensional mining of literature enabled analyzing the development of the machine tool domain systematically from multi-perspectives that include research, technology development and industry to provide inspirations about the implications of sustainable development of this domain. The conclusions obtained in this paper is beneficial to different communities of machine tools, in terms of determining the research directions for researchers, identifying industry opportunities for corporations and developing reasonable industry policy for policy makers. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - While the emergence of big data raises concerns regarding governance and public policy, it also creates opportunities for diversifying the toolkit for analysis for the policy sciences as a whole, i.e., research concerning policy analysis as well as policy studies. Further, it opens avenues for practice, which together with research requires adaptation in teaching curricula if policy education were to remain relevant. However, it is not clear to what extent this opportunity is being realized in public policy research and teaching. In this study, we examine the prevalence of big data analytics in public policy research and pedagogy using bibliometric analysis and topic modeling for the former, and content analysis of course titles and descriptions for the latter. We find that despite significant scope for application of various big data techniques, the use of these analytic techniques in public policy has been largely limited to select institutions in a few countries. Further, data science has received limited attention in policy pedagogy, once again with significant geographic variation in its prevalence. We conclude that, to stay relevant, the policy sciences need to pay more attention to the integration of big data techniques in policy research, pedagogy, and thereby practice. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose: Previous research concerning automatic extraction of research topics mostly used rule-based or topic modeling methods, which were challenged due to the limited rules, the interpretability issue and the heavy dependence on human judgment. This study aims to address these issues with the proposal of a new method that integrates machine learning models with linguistic features for the identification of research topics. Design/methodology/approach: First, dependency relations were used to extract noun phrases from research article texts. Second, the extracted noun phrases were classified into topics and non-topics via machine learning models and linguistic and bibliometric features. Lastly, a trend analysis was performed to identify hot research topics, i.e. topics with increasing popularity. Findings: The new method was experimented on a large dataset of COVID-19 research articles and achieved satisfactory results in terms of f-measures, accuracy and AUC values. Hot topics of COVID-19 research were also detected based on the classification results. Originality/value: This study demonstrates that information retrieval methods can help researchers gain a better understanding of the latest trends in both COVID-19 and other research areas. The findings are significant to both researchers and policymakers. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - An increasing number of articles published in different scientific fields makes it necessary to analyze the topics of these articles in specialized journals. For this purpose, topics published in the studies on medical librarianship and information in specialized journals were identified and analyzed in the present research. In the present study, an exploratory and descriptive approach was used to analyze medical librarianship and information articles published in specialized journals of this field from 1964 to 2019 by employing text-mining techniques. A latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling algorithm was used to identify the published topics. Python programming language was also used to run text-mining algorithms. The findings of text mining and topic modeling showed that the following topics were published in medical librarianship and information: Patients' use of information resources (34%), Medical Librarianship and Information Services (18%), Scientometrics and bibliometrics (16.32%), Web-based treatment (15.47%), Information literacy and information skills (13.9%), and Trend and tweet analysis (1.92%).

AB  - The detection of emerging trends is of great interest to many stakeholders such as government and industry. Previous research focused on the machine learning, network analysis and time series analysis based on the bibliometrics data and made a promising progress. However, these approaches inevitably have time delay problems. For the reason that leader papers of “emerging topics” share the similar characters with the “cover papers”, this study present a novel approach to translate the “emerging topics” detection to “cover paper” prediction. By using “AdaBoost model” and topic model, we construct a machine learning framework to imitate the top journal (chief) editor’s judgement to select cover paper from material science. The results of our prediction were validated by consulting with field experts. This approach was also suitable for the Nature, Science, and Cell journals. © 2022, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

The objective of this study is to compare the two description systems in documents about cannabis research to find the concordance between systems and establish whether there is neutrality in topic mapping. A total of 25,593 articles from 1970 to 2019 were drawn from Web of Science's Core Collection and Medline and analyzed. The tidytext library, Zipf's law, topic modeling tools, the contingency coefficient, Cramer's V, and Cohen's kappa were used. The results included 10,107 MeSH terms and 28,870 KeyWords Plus terms. The Zipf distribution of the terms was different for each system in terms of slope and specificity. The documents were classified into seven topics, and the MeSH system proved better at classification. The kappa coefficient between the two systems was 0.477 (for gamma ≥ 0.2); the topics related with human beings presented higher concordance. The use of KeyWords Plus for topic analyses in biomedical areas is not neutral, and this point needs to be taken into account in interpreting results. © 2021

AB  - Aspects of sustainable construction investment and real estate development (CIRED) and their interrelations during the period pre-, intra-, and post-COVID-19, are presented in the research. Applications of the topic model, environmental psychology theory, building life cycle method, and certain elements of bibliometrics, webometrics, article level metrics, altmetrics, and scientometrics make it possible to perform a quantitative analysis on CIRED. The CIRED topic model was developed in seven steps. This paper aims to present a literature review on CIRED throughout the pandemic and to look at the responses from the real estate and construction sector. This sector is a field that appears to be rapidly expanding, judging from the volume of current research papers. This review focuses on last year’s leading peer-reviewed journals. A combination of various keywords was applied for the review and the criteria for paper selections included construction investment, real estate development, civil engineering, COVID-19, and sustainability, as well as residential, industrial, commercial, land, and special purpose real estate, along with their risks, strategies, and trends. The articles reviewed for this paper, which analyzes three hypotheses, look at pre-, intra-, and post-pandemic CIRED. The three hypotheses were validated by analyzing scientific publications from around the world. Two innovative elements make this study stand out among the most advanced research on pre-, intra-, and post-pandemic CIRED. The first of the two innovations is the integrated analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19-related national policies, and business investment strategies relevant to CIRED and the interests of investors as well as on the impact a CIRED policy and investors make on the spread of COVID-19. In addition, this research demonstrates a marked increase in the effectiveness of a CIRED analysis, when the life cycle of a CIRED, the involved stakeholders with their own individual interests, the COVID-19 situation, and the external micro-, meso-, and macro-environments are covered comprehensively as a single entity. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The challenging situations and disruptions that occurred due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic have created a severe need for supply chain resiliency (SCR). There has been a growing interest among researchers to investigate the resiliency in supply chain operations to overcome risks and disruptions and to achieve successful project management. The supply chain of every business requires innovative projects to accomplish competitive advantage in the market. This study was conducted to identify the significance of artificial intelligence (AI) for creating a sustainable and resilient supply chain, and also to provide optimum solutions for supply chain risk mitigation. A systematic literature review has been conducted to examine the potential research contribution or directions in the field of AI and SCR. In total, 162 articles were shortlisted from the SCOPUS database in the chosen field of research. Structural Topic Modeling (STM), a big data-based approach, was employed to generate several thematic topics of AI in SCR based on the shortlisted articles, and all topics were discussed. Furthermore, the bibliometric analysis was conducted using R-package to investigate the research trends in the area of AI in SCR. Based on the conducted review of literature, a research framework was proposed for AI in SCR that will facilitate researchers and practitioners to improve technological development in supply chain firms. The purpose is to combat sudden risks and disruptions so that project management will perform well Post COVID-19. The study will be also helpful for future researchers and practitioners to identify research directions based on existing literature covered in this paper in the field of SCR. Future research directions are proposed for AI-enabled resilient supply chain management. This study will also provide several implications for supply chain managers to achieve the required resilience in their supply chains post COVID-19 by focusing on the elements of the proposed research framework. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly around the world. With the growing attention on the deadly pandemic, discussions and research on COVID-19 are rapidly increasing to exchange latest findings with the hope to accelerate the pace of finding a cure. As a branch of information technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has greatly expedited the development of human society. In this paper, we investigate and visualize the on-going advancements of early scientific research on COVID-19 from the perspective of AI. By adopting the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, this paper allocates the research articles into 50 key research topics pertinent to COVID-19 according to their abstracts. We present an overview of early studies of the COVID-19 crisis at different scales including referencing/citation behavior, topic variation and their inner interactions. We also identify innovative papers that are regarded as the cornerstones in the development of COVID-19 research. The results unveil the focus of scientific research, thereby giving deep insights into how the academic society contributes to combating the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In March 2020, the European Commission published the EU Taxonomy, a classification system of economic activities that can be considered environmentally sustainable. Motivated by this policy initiative, we propose a bibliometric analysis, based on theWeb of Science database for the period January 1990-March 2020, regarding the extant scientific production related to the EU Taxonomy environmental objectives and macro-sectors. We find that a considerable number of scientific works-161,595 publications-have investigated Taxonomy-related areas, showing that the EU Taxonomy defined a working method, based on the cooperation among regulators, academics, and industry, representing a valuable example of evidence-based policy making. Furthermore, topic modelling analysis shows that extracted papers focused on improvements in production processes, innovation, and environmental performance. Thus, exploiting time and geographic patterns of the scientific publications, we perform a multivariate analysis to investigate its relationship with subsequent levels of pollution. Our evidence shows that, for the past, a higher level of EU Taxonomy-related publications is associated with a lower level of CO2 emissions, supporting the view that scientific production has a societal impact in terms of environmental sustainability. Accordingly, now that EU Taxonomy-related topics have been incorporated into policy measures, further positive environmental effects are expected from here on out. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Natural language processing (NLP) is an effective tool for generating structured information from unstructured data, the one that is commonly found in clinical trial texts. Such interdisciplinary research has gradually grown into a flourishing research field with accumulated scientific outputs available. In this study, bibliographical data collected from Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus databases from 2001 to 2018 had been investigated with the use of three prominent methods, including performance analysis, science mapping, and, particularly, an automatic text analysis approach named structural topic modeling. Topical trend visualization and test analysis were further employed to quantify the effects of the year of publication on topic proportions. Topical diverse distributions across prolific countries/regions and institutions were also visualized and compared. In addition, scientific collaborations between countries/regions, institutions, and authors were also explored using social network analysis. The findings obtained were essential for facilitating the development of the NLP-enhanced clinical trial texts processing, boosting scientific and technological NLP-enhanced clinical trial research, and facilitating inter-country/region and inter-institution collaborations. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Submerged macrophytes, as one of the most important primary producers in shallow lakes and streams, have attracted significant research attention, with relevant studies showing dynamic evolution over the past three decades. Here, we investigated the trends and characteristics of 2,836 relevant articles published between 1991 and 2018 based on bibliometric analysis. Our geographic-based results indicated a scarcity of studies on submerged macrophytes in Africa, but strong international collaboration in this field, especially that between Denmark and China. The top two core journal sources (Hydrobiologia and Aquatic Botany) of studies on submerged macrophytes were determined, with another four important sources also identified. In addition, three trends in abstract word dynamics were found over the last three decades: i.e. most frequent word (‘lake’); increased words (those related to restoration, ecosystem state, model, and macrophyte community); and decreased words (those related to fish and specific macrophyte genera). Furthermore, our case study on four macrophyte genera showed a close relationship between Hydrilla and Vallisneria and between Potamogeton and Myriophyllum, as verified via the topic-article relationships determined using the topic model. The thematic evolution map of keywords used during the last three decades showed a clear shift in scientific fields; for example, Myriophyllum spicatum was an important keyword during 1999 and 2011 but not in other periods. We found that studies on submerged macrophytes developed with an increase in applied ecology topics, such as lake restoration, and basic scientific topics, such as freshwater ecosystems and plant physiology. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The application of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in assisting human electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis has become an active scientific field. This study aims to present a comprehensive review of the research field of AI-enhanced human EEG analysis. Using bibliometrics and topic modeling, research articles concerning AI-enhanced human EEG analysis collected from the Web of Science database during the period 2009–2018 were analyzed. After examining 2053 research articles published around the world, it was found that the annual number of articles had significantly grown from 78 to 468, with the USA and China being the most influential and prolific. The results of the keyword analysis showed that “electroencephalogram,” “brain–computer interface,” “classification,” “support vector machine,” “electroencephalography,” and “signal” were the most frequently used. The results of topic modeling and evolution analyses highlighted several important issues, including epileptic seizure detection, brain–machine interface, EEG classification, mental disorders, emotion, and alcoholism and anesthesia. The findings suggest that such visualization and analysis of the research articles could provide a comprehensive overview of the field for communities of practice and inquiry worldwide. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd. part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The goal of this paper is to provide a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications that employ text mining in management. To accomplish this, the authors collected 1282 documents from the Web of Science and performed performance analysis and science mapping with the help of the Bibliometrix package in Rstudio. The performance analysis used a range of bibliometric indicators such as productivity, citations, h-index, and m-quotient, in order to identify research trends and the most influential journals, authors, countries, and literature in the study. Science mapping used author keywords co-occurrence, co-authorship, and co-citation analysis to reflect the conceptual, social, and intellectual structure of the research. Specifically, we have seen an exponential increase in the use of text mining in management in recent years. The United States is the dominant country for research, having the earliest studies and the highest number of literature and citations. Furthermore, the research themes showed that topic modeling is at the forefront of current text mining research about management. This study will help scholars and management practitioners interested in the intersection of text mining and management to quickly understand the latest advances in research.  © 2021 Guandong Song et al.
