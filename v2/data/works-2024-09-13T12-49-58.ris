AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the structure and dynamics of academic articles relating to public procurement (PP) in the period 1984–2022 (up to May). The researchers also intend to analyse how this knowledge domain has grown since 1984. Design/methodology/approach A bibliometric analysis was carried out to examine the existing state of PP research. Based on 640 journal articles indexed in the Scopus database and written by 1,247 authors over nearly four decades, a bibliometric analysis was conducted to reveal the intellectual structure of academic works pertaining to PP. Findings Findings reveal that PP research from Scopus has significantly increased in the past decade. Major journals publishing PP research are International Journal of Procurement Management , Journal of Cleaner Production , Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management and Public Money and Management . Results also indicate that authors’ cooperation network is fragmented, showing limited collaboration among PP researchers. In addition, results suggest that the institutional collaboration network in PP research mirrors what is commonly referred to as the North–South divide, signifying insufficient research collaboration between developed and developing countries’ institutions. According to the co-occurrence keyword network and topic modelling, PP revolves around five main themes, including innovation, corruption, sustainable and green PP, PP contracts and small and medium enterprises. Based on these results, several directions for future research are suggested. Social implications This paper provides an increased understanding of the entire PP field and the potential research directions. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first-ever application of bibliometric techniques and topic modelling to examine the development of PP research since 1984 based on scholarly publications extracted from the Scopus database.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has brought unprecedented growth and productivity in every socioeconomic sector. AI adoption in education is transformational through reduced teacher workload, individualized learning, intelligent tutors, profiling and prediction, high-precision education, collaboration, and learner tracking. This paper highlights the trajectory of AI research in higher education (HE) through bibliometric analysis and topic modeling approaches. We used the PRISMA guidelines to select 304 articles published in the Scopus database between 2012 and 2021. VOSviewer was used for visualization and text-mining to identify hotspots in the field. Latent Dirichlet Allocation analysis reveals distinct topics in the dynamic relationship between AI and HE. Only 9.6% of AI research in HE was achieved in the first seven years, with the last three years contributing 90.4%. China, the United States, Russia and the United Kingdom dominated publications. Four themes emerged – data as the catalyst, the development of AI, the adoption of AI in HE and emerging trends and the future of AI in HE. Topic modeling on the abstracts revealed the 10 most frequent topics and the top 30 most salient terms. This research contributes to the literature by synthesizing AI adoption opportunities in HE, topic modeling and future research areas.

AB  - Purpose The emergence of machine learning has opened a new way for researchers. It allows them to supplement the traditional manual methods for conducting a literature review and turning it into smart literature. This study aims to present a framework for incorporating machine learning into financial statement fraud (FSF) literature analysis. This framework facilitates the analysis of a large amount of literature to show the trend of the field and identify the most productive authors, journals and potential areas for future research. Design/methodology/approach In this study, a framework was introduced that merges bibliometric analysis techniques such as word frequency, co-word analysis and coauthorship analysis with the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling approach. This framework was used to uncover subtopics from 20 years of financial fraud research articles. Furthermore, the hierarchical clustering method was used on selected subtopics to demonstrate the primary contexts in the literature on FSF. Findings This study has contributed to the literature in two ways. First, this study has determined the top journals, articles, countries and keywords based on various bibliometric metrics. Second, using topic modeling and then hierarchy clustering, this study demonstrates the four primary contexts in FSF detection. Research limitations/implications In this study, the authors tried to comprehensively view the studies related to financial fraud conducted over two decades. However, this research has limitations that can be an opportunity for future researchers. The first limitation is due to language bias. This study has focused on English language articles, so it is suggested that other researchers consider other languages as well. The second limitation is caused by citation bias. In this study, the authors tried to show the top articles based on the citation criteria. However, judging based on citation alone can be misleading. Therefore, this study suggests that the researchers consider other measures to check the citation quality and assess the studies’ precision by applying meta-analysis. Originality/value Despite the popularity of bibliometric analysis and topic modeling, there have been limited efforts to use machine learning for literature review. This novel approach of using hierarchical clustering on topic modeling results enable us to uncover four primary contexts. Furthermore, this method allowed us to show the keywords of each context and highlight significant articles within each context.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the scientific research that has addressed the negative impact of technology in the educational field.The research is implemented from a methodological approach based on the bibliometric mapping of the scientific production registered in the Web of Science in the period 2008-2019.To do this, indicators of growth, production, impact, topics, keywords, journal references, and analysis of co-citations of authors and co-authors are analyzed.This bibliometric approach is complemented by the analysis of the density, frequency and degree of centrality of the main terms associated with the difficulties and problems of technology in education located in the abstracts and discussion of results in the period 2016-2019.For this purpose, graph theory is developed, using the sigma, cytoscape and graphology libraries.The results show that, among the most common disadvantages linked to the use of technology in education, are: privacy problems, discerning reliable and relevant information, the time required for the preparation of educational materials, the negative impact on academic performance of the students, the lack of resources for its implementation in the classrooms and the infoxication.Finally, it should be noted that in the last three years, the negative impact of technology in the psychosocial field and its impact on teaching-learning processes are beginning to be analyzed in greater depth.

AB  - This study investigates the evolution of information science research based on bibliometric analysis and semantic mining. The study discusses the value and application of metadata tagging and topic modeling. Forty-two thousand seven hundred thirty-eight articles were extracted from Clarivate Analytic's Web of Science Core Collection 2010-2020. This study was divided into two phases. Firstly, bibliometric analyzes were performed with VOSviewer. Secondly, the topic identification and evolution trends of information science research were conducted through the topic modeling approach latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) is often used to extract themes from a corpus, and the topic model was a representation of a collection of documents that is simplified using topic-modeling-toolkit (TMT). The top 10 core topics (tags) were information research design, information health-based, model data public, study information studies, analysis effect implications, knowledge support web, data research, social research study, study media information, and research impact time for the studied period. Not only does topic modeling assist in identifying popular topics or related areas within a researcher's area, but it may be used to discover emerging topics or areas of study throughout time.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising field in cardiovascular disease (CVD) research, offering innovative approaches to enhance diagnosis, treatment, and patient outcomes. In this study, we conducted bibliometric analysis combined with topic modeling to provide a comprehensive overview of the AI research landscape in CVD. Our analysis included 23,846 studies from Web of Science and PubMed, capturing the latest advancements and trends in this rapidly evolving field. By employing LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) we identified key research themes, trends, and collaborations within the AI-CVD domain. The findings revealed the exponential growth of AI-related research in CVD, underscoring its immense potential to revolutionize cardiovascular healthcare. The annual scientific publication of machine learning papers in CVD increases continuously and significantly since 2016, with an overall annual growth rate of 22.8%. Almost half (46.2%) of the growth happened in the last 5 years. USA, China, India, UK and Korea were the top five productive countries in number of publications. UK, Germany and Australia were the most collaborative countries with a multiple country publication (MCP) value of 42.8%, 40.3% and 40.0% respectively. We observed the emergence of twenty-two distinct research topics, including “stroke and robotic rehabilitation therapy,” “robotic-assisted cardiac surgery,” and “cardiac image analysis,” which persisted as major topics throughout the years. Other topics, such as “retinal image analysis and CVD” and “biomarker and wearable signal analyses,” have recently emerged as dominant areas of research in cardiovascular medicine. Convolutional neural network appears to be the most mentioned algorithm followed by LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours). This indicates that the future direction of AI cardiovascular research is predominantly directing toward neural networks and image analysis. As AI continues to shape the landscape of CVD research, our study serves as a comprehensive guide for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, providing valuable insights into the current state of AI in CVD research. This study offers a deep understanding of research trends and paves the way for future directions to maximiz the potential of AI to effectively combat cardiovascular diseases.

AB  - Abstract The surge in text data has driven extensive research into developing diverse automatic summarization approaches to effectively handle vast textual information. There are several reviews on this topic, yet no large‐scale analysis based on quantitative approaches has been conducted. To provide a comprehensive overview of the field, this study conducted a bibliometric analysis of 3108 papers published from 2010 to 2022, focusing on automatic summarization research regarding topics and trends, top sources, countries/regions, institutions, researchers, and scientific collaborations. We have identified the following trends. First, the number of papers has experienced 65% growth, with the majority being published in computer science conferences. Second, Asian countries and institutions, notably China and India, actively engage in this field and demonstrate a strong inclination toward inter‐regional international collaboration, contributing to more than 24% and 20% of the output, respectively. Third, researchers show a high level of interest in multihead and attention mechanisms, graph‐based semantic analysis, and topic modeling and clustering techniques, with each topic having a prevalence of over 10%. Finally, scholars have been increasingly interested in self‐supervised and zero/few‐shot learning, multihead and attention mechanisms, and temporal analysis and event detection. This study is valuable when it comes to enhancing scholars' and practitioners' understanding of the current hotspots and future directions in automatic summarization. This article is categorized under: Algorithmic Development &gt; Text Mining

AB  - - In the last five years, there has been an accelerated growth in the scientific production about Artificial Intelligence and Healthcare by Scholars of the most diverse disciplines. Recently, the scientific corpus has been enriched with considerable literature reviews ranging from the overview of large collections of scientific documents to the recognition of the state of knowledge on specific aspects (e.g., in the medical field, ophthalmology, cardiology, nephrology, etc.). - The methodological approaches belong to the scientific fields of bibliometrics and topic modeling. Following a bibliometric analysis of the literature on the subject, conducted on a vast collection of scientific contributions, we also searched for the "latent" themes in the semantic structures of these documents, identified the relationships between them and recognized the most likely to be investigated in the future. – Results show 24 topics about future trends in literature review connecting the field of AI and Healthcare. - This bibliometric review of the literature on artificial intelligence and healthcare allows identifying of some privileged areas of attention by scholars of different disciplines. However, it also reveals the limits of hard clustering techniques, as demonstrated by the presence of some keywords in several groups. The numerous existing reviews must be integrated by reviews based on Topic Modeling techniques, which make it possible to identify topics, historical trends (classical and emerging topics), associations between the documents and to predict, on a probabilistic basis, which scientific fields will be most likely to see development in the future.

AB  - Computers & Education has been leading the field of computers in education for over 40 years, during which time it has developed into a well-known journal with significant influences on the educational technology research community. Questions such as “in what research topics were the academic community of Computers & Education interested?” “how did such research topics evolve over time?” and “what were the main research concerns of its major contributors?” are important to both the editorial board and readership of Computers & Education. To address these issues, this paper conducted a structural topic modeling analysis of 3963 articles published in Computers & Education between 1976 and 2018 bibliometrically. A structural topic model was used to profile the research hotspots. By further exploring annual topic proportion trends and topic correlations, potential future research directions and inter-topic research areas were identified. The major research concerns of the publications in Computers & Education by prolific countries/regions were shown and compared. Thus, this work provided useful insights and implications, and it could be used as a guide for contributors to Computers & Education.

AB  - Blockchain has become one of the core technologies in Industry 4.0. To help decision-makers establish action plans based on blockchain, it is an urgent task to analyze trends in blockchain technology. However, most of existing studies on blockchain trend analysis are based on effort demanding full-text investigation or traditional bibliometric methods whose study scope is limited to a frequency-based statistical analysis. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new topic modeling method called Word2vec-based Latent Semantic Analysis (W2V-LSA), which is based on Word2vec and Spherical k-means clustering to better capture and represent the context of a corpus. We then used W2V-LSA to perform an annual trend analysis of blockchain research by country and time for 231 abstracts of blockchain-related papers published over the past five years. The performance of the proposed algorithm was compared to Probabilistic LSA, one of the common topic modeling techniques. The experimental results confirmed the usefulness of W2V-LSA in terms of the accuracy and diversity of topics by quantitative and qualitative evaluation. The proposed method can be a competitive alternative for better topic modeling to provide direction for future research in technology trend analysis and it is applicable to various expert systems related to text mining.

AB  - Topic extraction is an essential task in bibliometric data analysis, data mining and knowledge discovery, which seeks to identify significant topics from text collections. The conventional topic extraction schemes require human intervention and involve also comprehensive pre-processing tasks to represent text collections in an appropriate way. In this paper, we present a two-stage framework for topic extraction from scientific literature. The presented scheme employs a two-staged procedure, where word embedding schemes have been utilized in conjunction with cluster analysis. To extract significant topics from text collections, we propose an improved word embedding scheme, which incorporates word vectors obtained by word2vec, POS2vec, word-position2vec and LDA2vec schemes. In the clustering phase, an improved clustering ensemble framework, which incorporates conventional clustering methods (i.e., k-means, k-modes, k-means++, self-organizing maps and DIANA algorithm) by means of the iterative voting consensus, has been presented. In the empirical analysis, we analyze a corpus containing 160,424 abstracts of articles from various disciplines, including agricultural engineering, economics, engineering and computer science. In the experimental analysis, performance of the proposed scheme has been compared to conventional baseline clustering methods (such as, k-means, k-modes, and k-means++), LDA-based topic modelling and conventional word embedding schemes. The empirical analysis reveals that ensemble word embedding scheme yields better predictive performance compared to the baseline word vectors for topic extraction. Ensemble clustering framework outperforms the baseline clustering methods. The results obtained by the proposed framework show an improvement in Jaccard coefficient, Folkes & Mallows measure and F1 score.

AB  - This article maps the scientific literature in human mobility behavior in the context of the current pandemic. Through bibliometrics, we analyze the content of published scientific studies indexed on the Web of Science and Scopus during 2020. This enables us the detection of current hotspots and future directions of research. After a co-occurrence of keywords and evidence map analysis, four themes are identified, namely, Land Transport — Operations, Land Transport — Traffic Demand, Air Transport and Environment. We show how air transportation- and environmental-related studies tend to be more mature research whereas the understanding of changes in travel behavior (e.g., telecommuting, preventive measures or health protection behavior) tends to be immature. By using a topic modeling approach, we identify multiple sub-themes within each theme. Our framework adopts a smart literature review approach that can be constantly updated, enabling an analysis of many articles, with little investment of the researcher's time, but also provides high degree of transparency and replicability. We also put forth a research agenda that can help inform and shape transport policy and practice responses to COVID-19.

AB  - We examine the literature on the financial economics of precious metals from a bibliometric and scientometric perspective. We surface the main trends and authors in the area over the last two decades, and provide estimates of the density of the networks of both researchers and research. Clear evidence is provided of an area dominated by a number of high output researchers, with distinct and clear areas of research with little overlap. A probabilistic topic modelling approach is further applied to determine the main topics of research in the area. We conclude that there are significant areas of potential synergy as yet unexploited in this research domain. We also highlight the current topics that can be a particularly important focus for these synergy efforts.

AB  - Objectives The incidence of oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) is increasing. This study used bibliometric analysis and topic modeling to explore the research trends and advancements in this disease over the past 10 years, providing valuable insights to guide future investigations. Methods 7,355 English articles from 2013 to 2022 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection for bibliometric analysis. Topic modeling was applied to 1,681 articles from high-impact journals, followed by an assessment of topic significance ranking (TSR). Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms were extracted using R and Python, followed by an analysis of the terms associated with each topic and on an annual basis. Additionally, genes were extracted and the number of genes appearing each year and the newly emerged genes were counted. Results The bibliometric analysis suggested that the United States and several European countries hold pivotal positions in research. Current research is focused on refining treatments, staging and stratification. Topic modeling revealed 12 topics, emphasizing human papillomavirus (HPV) and side effect reduction. MeSH analysis revealed a growing emphasis on prognosis and quality of life. No new MeSH terms emerged after 2018, suggesting that the existing terms have covered most of the core concepts within the field of oropharyngeal cancers. Gene analysis identified TP53 and EGFR as the most extensively studied genes, with no novel genes discovered after 2019. However, CD69 and CXCL9 emerged as new genes of interest in 2019, reflecting recent research trends and directions. Conclusion HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer research, particularly treatment de-escalation, has gained significant attention. However, there are still challenges in diagnosis and treatment that need to be addressed. In the future, more research will focus on this issue, indicating that this field still holds potential as a research hotspot.

AB  - Green building research has received a lot of attention from both academicians and practitioners. Even though, this has resulted in a surge in Green Building literature in the recent times, the review of the literature has either being too focused on specific aspects or too broad. This study attempts to address this issue by employing a combination of bibliometric analysis and topic modelling. The inclusion of a stringent quality filter and use of CorEx topic modelling has enabled us to generate a list of future research directions, which were further streamlined through manual intervention. The study has revealed a few very promising few research directions including the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Green Building, Building Information System (BIM) for Green Building, development of sustainable materials and construction methods, socio-economic impact assessment of Green Buildings and incorporation of Internal Environmental Quality principles into built environment. The findings of the study are an integration of recommendations by many impactful studies in the Green Building literature and have tried to be a true testament to the idea that ‘the whole is greater than the sum of its parts’.

AB  - In stock markets, technical analysis plays a vital role by offering valuable insights into price trends, patterns, and anticipated market movements, aiding investors in making well-informed decisions. This study employs bibliometric and topic modelling approaches on 589 English-language journal articles indexed in Scopus in the last two decades (from 2003 to 2023), exclusively focusing on technical analysis in stock markets. The keyword co-occurrence analysis identifies five topic clusters. The application of structural topic modelling also unravels five prominent thematic clusters, namely pattern-based forecasting, rule-based trading, algorithmic trading, techno-fundamental trading, and machine learning &amp;amp;amp; sentiment analysis. The topic of pattern-based forecasting involves researching the application of various patterns or models to predict stock prices. Rule-based trading concentrates on utilizing technical analysis tools to generate buy and sell signals, aiming for profitability. The algorithmic trading cluster explores the use of algorithms to systematically execute buy and sell actions, especially in high-frequency trading scenarios. Techno-fundamental trading investigates the integration of both fundamental and technical analysis in trading and investment decisions. Lastly, machine learning &amp;amp;amp; sentiment analysis focus on applying advanced machine learning techniques and sentiment analysis for predicting stock prices, highlighting the use of sophisticated methods in this domain. The three predominant topics in the dataset are &amp;quot;rule-based trading,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;machine learning &amp;amp;amp; sentiment analysis,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;algorithmic trading&amp;quot; constituting 26.79%, 23.52%, and 21.11% of the dataset, respectively. These findings underscore the prominence and significance of these themes within the context of the research domain.

AB  - Purpose Metaverse is a virtual application spawned by digital technology that is becoming increasingly relevant to our lives. However, for the opportunities created and challenges posed by the metaverse, its important elements and future evolution trend remain largely unknown. Thus, this paper aims to understand the current status of metaverse research and its future research directions. Design/methodology/approach Based on the analysis of the literature data on the metaverse both in English and Chinese using Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling and bibliometrics, this study discussed the related research and development trend of the metaverse. The authors first defined the concept of the metaverse and analyzed 1,378 English articles from seven publishers and 590 Chinese articles from the CNKI database. Following that, the authors summarized three important themes from the current studies: virtual world, metaverse technologies and metaverse applications. Finally, a framework of future directions on metaverse research was proposed. Findings The review found that during the rapid development of the metaverse, opportunities and challenges coexisted. In the virtual world, metaverse technologies drive the implementation of application scenarios, and in turn, applications promote the improvement of technologies. The interrelationship between technology and application lays the foundation for the development of the metaverse. Future metaverse research will generate different research directions. Originality/value This review provides a valuable, systematic perspective for individuals who want to understand the metaverse. The conceptual framework on metaverse research proposed in this paper offers a comparison of literature analysis from domestic and international perspectives and brings new insights into the development of the metaverse.

AB  - The digital twin has recently become a popular topic in research related to manufacturing, such as Industry 4.0, the industrial internet of things, and cyber-physical systems. In addition, digital twins are the focus of several research areas: construction, urban management, digital transformation of the economy, medicine, virtual reality, software testing, and others. The concept is not yet fully defined, its scope seems unlimited, and the topic is relatively new; all this can present a barrier to research. The main goal of this paper is to develop a proper methodology for visualizing the digital-twin science landscape using modern bibliometric tools, text-mining and topic-modeling, based on machine learning models—Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The scope of the study includes 8693 publications on the topic selected from the Scopus database, published between January 1993 and September 2022. Keyword co-occurrence analysis and topic-modeling indicate that studies on digital twins are still in the early stage of development. At the same time, the core of the topic is growing, and some topic clusters are emerging. More than 100 topics can be identified; the most popular and fastest-growing topic is ‘digital twins of industrial robots, production lines and objects.’ Further efforts are needed to verify the proposed methodology, which can be achieved by analyzing other research fields.

AB  - In March 2020, the European Commission published the EU Taxonomy, a classification system of economic activities that can be considered environmentally sustainable. Motivated by this policy initiative, we propose a bibliometric analysis, based on the Web of Science database for the period January 1990–March 2020, regarding the extant scientific production related to the EU Taxonomy environmental objectives and macro-sectors. We find that a considerable number of scientific works—161,595 publications—have investigated Taxonomy-related areas, showing that the EU Taxonomy defined a working method, based on the cooperation among regulators, academics, and industry, representing a valuable example of evidence-based policy making. Furthermore, topic modelling analysis shows that extracted papers focused on improvements in production processes, innovation, and environmental performance. Thus, exploiting time and geographic patterns of the scientific publications, we perform a multivariate analysis to investigate its relationship with subsequent levels of pollution. Our evidence shows that, for the past, a higher level of EU Taxonomy-related publications is associated with a lower level of CO2 emissions, supporting the view that scientific production has a societal impact in terms of environmental sustainability. Accordingly, now that EU Taxonomy-related topics have been incorporated into policy measures, further positive environmental effects are expected from here on out.

AB  - A management information system (MIS) is a system that manages, processes, and presents information to management that aims to improve the quality of decisions and policies. A common misconception regarding the management information system (MIS) topic is that it mainly involves programming. This study aims to capture the intellectual structure and theme evolution of MIS by incorporating latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) into its methodology. A bibliometric analysis was conducted to evaluate the publication characteristics of the top three MIS journals (IJIM, JSIS, and MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems) from the SCOPUS database between 1980 and 2021. Our findings indicate the trend of publishing articles, the structure of science, and the topics that stand out in the top three journals.

AB  - The world is moving into a situation where resource scarcity leads to an increase in material cost. A possible way to deal with the above challenge is to adopt Circular Economy (CE) concepts to make a close loop of material by eliminating industrial or post-consumer wastes. Integration of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning, and big data analytics provides significant support in successfully adopting and implementing CE practices. This study aims to explore the applications of AI techniques in enhancing the adoption and implementation of CE practices. A systematic literature review was performed to analyze the existing scenario and the potential research directions of AI in CE. A collection of 220 articles was shortlisted from the SCOPUS database in the field of AI in CE. A text mining approach, known as Structural Topic Modeling (STM), was used to generate different thematic topics of AI applications in CE. Each generated topic was then discussed with shortlisted articles. Further, a bibliometric study was performed to analyze the research trends in the field of AI applications in CE. A research framework was proposed for AI in CE based on the review conducted, which could help industrial practitioners, and researchers working in this domain. Further, future research propositions on AI in CE were proposed.

AB  - Text mining methods can find large scale trends within research communities. For example, using stable Latent Dirichlet Allocation (a topic modeling algorithm) this study found 10 major topics in 35,391 SE research papers from 34 leading SE venues over the last 25 years (divided, evenly, between conferences and journals). Out study also shows how those topics have changed over recent years. Also, we note that (in the historical record) mono-focusing on a single topic can lead to fewer citations than otherwise. Further, while we find no overall gender bias in SE authorship, we note that women are under-represented in the top-most cited papers in our field. Lastly, we show a previously unreported dichotomy between software conferences and journals (so research topics that succeed at conferences might not succeed at journals, and vice versa). An important aspect of this work is that it is automatic and quickly repeatable (unlike prior SE bibliometric studies that used tediously slow and labor intensive methods). Automation is important since, like any data mining study, its conclusions are skewed by the data used in the analysis. The automatic methods of this paper make it far easier for other researchers to re-apply the analysis to new data, or if they want to use different modeling assumptions.

AB  - Product Returns (PR) are an inevitable yet costly process in business, especially in the online marketplace. How to deal with the conundrums has attracted a great deal of attention from both practitioners and researchers. This paper aims to synthesise research developments in the PR domain in order to provide an insightful picture of current research and explore future directions for the research community. To ensure research rigour, we adapt a six-step framework - defining the topic, searching databases, cleaning and clustering data, paper selection, content analysis, and discussion. A hybrid approach is adopted for clustering and identifying the distribution and themes in a large number of publications collected from academic databases. The hybrid approach combines machine learning topic modelling and bibliometric analysis. The machine learning results indicate that the overall research can be clustered into three groups: (1) operations management of PR, covering (re)manufacturing network design, product recovery, reverse distribution, and quality of cores; (2) retailer and (re)manufacturer issues including return policy, channel, inventory, pricing, and information strategies; and (3) customer's psychology, experience, and perception on marketing-operation interface. Furthermore, from the content analysis, five potential future directions are discussed, namely digitalisation in the context of PR; globalisation versus localisation in the context of PR; multi-layer (i.e., retailer, manufacturer, logistics provider, online platform) and multi-channel (i.e., online, offline, dual and omni channel) oriented bespoke return policy; understanding and predicting customer return behaviour via online footprints; and customer return perception across the marketing–operations interface.

AB  - Among the next-generation photovoltaics (PVs), hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) have drawn tremendous attention from both academic and industrial communities, because of their compelling combination of high performance, high cost-effectiveness, and broader feasibility. Despite the rapid growth and importance of scientific progress in the PeSC field, there have been no systematic and bibliometric analyses of the PeSC research outputs. In this study, we systemically investigate the scientific publications of the PeSCs with bibliometric routes to map research trends and collaboration status. A total of 6,581 documents published during 2009–2018 are analyzed. For effective investigation, the commercialization factors are categorized by considering levelized cost of electricity and environmental impact; Cost, Efficiency, Stability, Scaling-up, and Public Acceptability. Furthermore, the combined bibliometric methods are employed as follows: statistical analyses of publication outputs, topic modeling based on publication abstracts with time-series and commercialization factors, and social network analysis of co-authorships at institute level. From the analyses of research trends, although the researches on Efficiency takes a large part in all periods, the researches on Scaling-up, Stability, and Public Acceptability have become more active over time. In the analyses of co-authorship network, the level of collaboration in the PeSC research is already globalized, which is led by European, Chinese, and Korean institutes. The comprehensive results not only track the changes in the PeSC field, but also provide useful information on the future direction for the market entry of the PeSCs and the next-generation PVs.

AB  - The goal of this paper is to provide a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications that employ text mining in management. To accomplish this, the authors collected 1282 documents from the Web of Science and performed performance analysis and science mapping with the help of the Bibliometrix package in Rstudio. The performance analysis used a range of bibliometric indicators such as productivity, citations, h-index, and m-quotient, in order to identify research trends and the most influential journals, authors, countries, and literature in the study. Science mapping used author keywords co-occurrence, co-authorship, and co-citation analysis to reflect the conceptual, social, and intellectual structure of the research. Specifically, we have seen an exponential increase in the use of text mining in management in recent years. The United States is the dominant country for research, having the earliest studies and the highest number of literature and citations. Furthermore, the research themes showed that topic modeling is at the forefront of current text mining research about management. This study will help scholars and management practitioners interested in the intersection of text mining and management to quickly understand the latest advances in research.

AB  - Technology and innovation management is vital emerging research fields. Technological Forecasting and Social Change (TFSC) has worked as a major forum in this field and is currently regarded as the leading journal. However, an increasing number of publications hamper a comprehensive understanding of the field and journal. In this study, we conducted a systematic review of TFSC with the support of bibliometric analysis. We used citation network analysis and topic models to extract research landscapes and trends. Our results illustrate how technology and innovation management research has developed through the interactions among theories, methods, and cases, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Based on our analysis and findings, we discuss the major branches of research, topics in the journal, and future perspectives.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic outbreak across the globe has disrupted human life and industry. The pandemic has affected every sector, with the real estate sector facing particular challenges. During the pandemic, property management became a crucial task and property managers were challenged to control risks and disruptions faced by their organizations. Recent innovative technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), have supported many sectors through sudden disruptions; this study was performed to examine the role of AI in the real estate and property management (PM) sectors. For this purpose, a systematic literature review was conducted using structural topic modeling and bibliometric analysis. Using appropriate keywords, the researchers found 175 articles on AI and PM research from 1980 to 2021 in the SCOPUS database. A bibliometric analysis was performed to identify research trends. Structural topic modelling (STM) identified ten emerging thematic topics in AI and PM. A comprehensive framework is proposed, and future research directions discussed.

AB  - Abstract While the emergence of big data raises concerns regarding governance and public policy, it also creates opportunities for diversifying the toolkit for analysis for the policy sciences as a whole, i.e., research concerning policy analysis as well as policy studies. Further, it opens avenues for practice, which together with research requires adaptation in teaching curricula if policy education were to remain relevant. However, it is not clear to what extent this opportunity is being realized in public policy research and teaching. In this study, we examine the prevalence of big data analytics in public policy research and pedagogy using bibliometric analysis and topic modeling for the former, and content analysis of course titles and descriptions for the latter. We find that despite significant scope for application of various big data techniques, the use of these analytic techniques in public policy has been largely limited to select institutions in a few countries. Further, data science has received limited attention in policy pedagogy, once again with significant geographic variation in its prevalence. We conclude that, to stay relevant, the policy sciences need to pay more attention to the integration of big data techniques in policy research, pedagogy, and thereby practice.

AB  - The combination of new-generation information technology and manufacturing technology has had in a significant and profound impact on the future development paradigm of manufacturing. Machine tools are the basis of virtually everything that is manufactured in the industry, exploring the development of the machine tool domain is of considerable significance to identify the opportunity to develop manufacturing industry and promote the sustainable development of manufacturing in the current tightening constraints of resource environment. Although much attention has been paid to development studies of a specific domain in recent years, it is challenging to conduct a multidimensional study related to the development status of the machine tool domain using existing methods. To solve this challenge, we propose an integrating framework combining topic models, bibliometric, trend analysis and patent analysis to mine multi-source literature within the machine tool domain, including papers, funds, patents, and news. Specifically, papers and funds provided two different perspectives to explore the development status in the research of machine tools. Furthermore, the technology development of machine tools was investigated through patents analysis. Finally, news related to the machine tool industry in recent years was analyzed to examine business focuses on machine tools. The integration of above various analytical methods and multi-dimensional mining of literature enabled analyzing the development of the machine tool domain systematically from multi-perspectives that include research, technology development and industry to provide inspirations about the implications of sustainable development of this domain. The conclusions obtained in this paper is beneficial to different communities of machine tools, in terms of determining the research directions for researchers, identifying industry opportunities for corporations and developing reasonable industry policy for policy makers.

AB  - Abstract The concept of Regional Competitiveness (RC), in the last years, had a considerable influence on the development of strategies and policies focused on sub-national areas from an economic and social perspective. In particular, RC attracted the substantial attention of policymakers due to the possibility of evaluating and comparing different territories without any established political or conceptual framework. Conversely, scholars have long debated the meaningfulness of territorial competitiveness itself and, in case, which dimensions have to be included. This study reviewed the most recent scientific literature concerning RC with a bibliometric approach based on topic modelling. The use of a textual-based statistical approach offered an interesting insight into the RC research domain. We highlighted the topics discussed by scholars, showing the patterns emerging across years and from different publication types, and marked the differences between the vocabulary used by authors coming from EU and non-EU countries. Finally, a comparison between the RC issues coming from the literature analysis with the RC issues defined by policymakers tried to link the two standpoints followed by the institutions and the academia in a more comprehensive conceptual framework.

AB  - The detection of emerging trends is of great interest to many stakeholders such as government and industry. Previous research focused on the machine learning, network analysis and time series analysis based on the bibliometrics data and made a promising progress. However, these approaches inevitably have time delay problems. For the reason that leader papers of "emerging topics" share the similar characters with the "cover papers", this study present a novel approach to translate the "emerging topics" detection to "cover paper" prediction. By using "AdaBoost model" and topic model, we construct a machine learning framework to imitate the top journal (chief) editor's judgement to select cover paper from material science. The results of our prediction were validated by consulting with field experts. This approach was also suitable for the Nature, Science, and Cell journals.

AB  - Organizations are increasingly leveraging the ability of artificial intelligence to analyze and resolve complex problems. This can potentially reshape the interdependencies and interactions of complex systems, leading to our research question: To what extent and in which direction is the literature on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and System Dynamics (SD) converging within the business and management landscape? We conducted an extensive literature review using bibliometric and topic modeling methods to address this question. Through a bibliometric analysis, we identified the areas in which academic papers referred to both SD and AI literature. However, bibliometrics do not show a clear path towards convergence. The top modeling analysis highlights more details on how convergence is structured, providing insights into how SD and AI may be integrated. Two trajectories are identified. In the “soft convergence,” AI supports system dynamics analysis and modeling more deeply characterized by social interaction. In the “hard convergence,” AI shapes innovative ways of rethinking system design, dynamics, and interdependencies. Our analysis suggests that while soft convergence is more visible in the business and management landscape, hard convergence may well represent a new frontier in studying system dynamics with the potential to reshape the landscape.

AB  - A fundamental structural transformation that must occur to break global temperature rise and advance sustainable development is the green transition to a low-carbon system. However, dismantling the carbon lock-in situation requires substantial investment in green finance. Historically, investments have been concentrated in carbon-intensive technologies. Nonetheless, green finance has blossomed in recent years, and efforts to organise this literature have emerged, but a deeper understanding of this growing field is needed. For this goal, this paper aims to delineate this literature’s existing groups and explore its heterogeneity. From a bibliometric coupling network, we identified the main groups in the literature; then, we described the characteristics of these articles through a novel combination of complex network analysis, topological measures, and a type of unsupervised machine learning technique called structural topic modelling (STM). The use of computational methods to explore literature trends is increasing as it is expected to be compatible with a large amount of information and complement the expert-based knowledge approach. The contribution of this article is twofold: first, identifying the most relevant articles in the network related to each group and, second, the most prestigious topics in the field and their contributions to the literature. A final sample of 3275 articles shows three main groups in the literature. The more mature is mainly related to the distribution of climate finance from the developed to the developing world. In contrast, the most recent ones are related to climate financial risks, green bonds, and the insertion of financial development in energy-emissions-economics models. Researchers and policy-makers can recognise current research challenges and make better decisions with the help of the central research topics and emerging trends identified from STM. The field’s evolution shows a clear movement from an international perspective to a nationally-determined discussion on finance to the green transition.

AB  - In recent decades, rapid growth has been observed in the incorporation of sustainability into marketing. Accordingly, the contrasting relationships between them have been carefully studied to assess the relevance of one idea to the other and vice versa. In response to this change, scholars and practitioners have been tasked with exploring the trends in sustainability and marketing. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate existing literatures on both sustainability and all levels of marketing, determine the research trends and provide implications of applying the trends for future research and practices. This research has investigated only the title, abstract, and keywords of 2147 articles that were published between 2010 and 2020 in SSCI or SCIE indexed journals by applying the topic modeling based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. The results show that the research trend has shifted from general sustainable concept to more environmental and industrial technology based on the empirical evidence of 14 latent topics of sustainability and marketing. This article aids in understanding the recent research trend in sustainability and marketing, and the findings will be a valuable resource for future scholars and practitioners. It contributes to both existing and future literatures by providing valuable insights from recent research trend in sustainability and marketing and by providing recommendations for future research avenue. Among other bibliometric review articles, this is the most up-to-date comprehensive and empirical article, providing overview of the research trend.

AB  - Discovering promising research themes in a scientific domain by evaluating semantic information extracted from bibliometric databases represents a challenging task for Natural Language Processing (NLP). While existing NLP methods generally characterize the research topics using unique key terms, we take a step further by more accurately modeling the research themes as finite sets of key terms. The proposed approach involves two stages: identifying the research themes from paper metadata using LDA topic modeling; and, evaluation of research theme trends by employing a version of the Mann-Kendall test that is able to cope with multivariate time series of term occurrences. The results obtained by applying this general methodology to Information Security domain confirm its viability.

AB  - Abstract In the evolving landscape of entrepreneurship, digital technologies have ushered in new possibilities, attracting considerable academic attention. Despite the burgeoning research in Digital Entrepreneurship, the field remains fragmented, warranting a synthesized overview and structured research agenda. Consistently with the above, the paper presents a quantitative mapping of Digital Entrepreneurship through a bibliometric analysis of its publications. The research aims to address the need for a comprehensive, bibliometric overview of the topic, which has been echoed in recently published papers. In order to achieve this goal, we collected data from the Web of Science database, a common and scientifically sound choice in entrepreneurship research. The data were analyzed by applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation and topic modeling, thus providing a unique approach to bibliometric mapping. Topic modeling allows for the processing and analysis of significant amounts of scientific data, thus making it an ideal tool for bibliometric research. We find the field of Digital Entrepreneurship to be rather lively and in rapid development, with several publication outlets, affiliations, and countries contributing to it. We found four main topics to be extracted: the implications of Digital Entrepreneurship for innovation, Digital Entrepreneurship as an enabler for empowerment, the transformation of business models through digitalization, and the surge of digital platforms as entrepreneurial ecosystems.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the landscape of parathyroid carcinoma research during the last 22 years using machine learning and text analysis.In November 2021, we obtained from PubMed all works indexed under the mesh subject line "parathyroid carcinoma". The entire set of search results was retrieved in XML format, and metadata such as title, abstract, keywords, mesh words, and year of publication were extracted for bibliometric evaluation from the original XML files. To increase the specificity of the investigation, the Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling method was applied.The paper analyzed 3578 papers. The volume of literature related to parathyroid cancer has been relatively flat over the past 22 years. In the field of parathyroid cancer research, the most important topic of clinical interest is the differential diagnosis. Ultrasound and MIBI are the most commonly used imaging methods for localization. In terms of basic research, the mechanisms of gene mutation and local tumor recurrence are the focus of interest.There are huge unmet research needs for parathyroid carcinoma. Improving the diagnosis rates of parathyroid cancer by clinicians and establishing new and reliable molecular pathological markers and new image localization techniques will continue to be the focus of future research.

AB  - The outbreak of Covid-19 created disruptions in manufacturing operations. One of the most serious negative impacts is the shortage of critical medical supplies. Manufacturing firms faced pressure from governments to use their manufacturing capacity to repurpose their production for meeting the critical demand for necessary products. For this purpose, recent advancements in technology and artificial intelligence (AI) could act as response solutions to conquer the threats linked with repurposing manufacturing (RM). The study's purpose is to investigate the significance of AI in RM through a systematic literature review (SLR). This study gathered around 453 articles from the SCOPUS database in the selected research field. Structural Topic Modelling (STM) was utilised to generate emerging research themes from the selected documents on AI in RM. In addition, to study the research trends in the field of AI in RM, a bibliometric analysis was undertaken using the R-package. The findings of the study showed that there is a vast scope for research in this area as the yearly global production of articles in this field is limited. However, it is an evolving field and many research collaborations were identified. The study proposes a comprehensive research framework and propositions for future research development.

AB  - Submerged macrophytes, as one of the most important primary producers in shallow lakes and streams, have attracted significant research attention, with relevant studies showing dynamic evolution over the past three decades. Here, we investigated the trends and characteristics of 2,836 relevant articles published between 1991 and 2018 based on bibliometric analysis. Our geographic-based results indicated a scarcity of studies on submerged macrophytes in Africa, but strong international collaboration in this field, especially that between Denmark and China. The top two core journal sources (Hydrobiologia and Aquatic Botany) of studies on submerged macrophytes were determined, with another four important sources also identified. In addition, three trends in abstract word dynamics were found over the last three decades: i.e. most frequent word (‘lake’); increased words (those related to restoration, ecosystem state, model, and macrophyte community); and decreased words (those related to fish and specific macrophyte genera). Furthermore, our case study on four macrophyte genera showed a close relationship between Hydrilla and Vallisneria and between Potamogeton and Myriophyllum, as verified via the topic-article relationships determined using the topic model. The thematic evolution map of keywords used during the last three decades showed a clear shift in scientific fields; for example, Myriophyllum spicatum was an important keyword during 1999 and 2011 but not in other periods. We found that studies on submerged macrophytes developed with an increase in applied ecology topics, such as lake restoration, and basic scientific topics, such as freshwater ecosystems and plant physiology.

AB  - Background: This study aimed to analyze the landscape of publications on bariatric metabolic surgery through machine learning and help experts and scholars from various disciplines better understand bariatric metabolic surgery’s hot topics and trends. Methods: In January 2021, publications indexed in PubMed under the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) term ‘Bariatric Surgery’ from 1946 to 2020 were downloaded. Python was used to extract publication dates, abstracts, and research topics from the metadata of publications for bibliometric evaluation. Descriptive statistical analysis, social network analysis (SNA), and topic modeling with latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) were used to reveal bariatric metabolic surgery publication growth trends, landscape, and research topics. Results: A total of 21,798 records of bariatric metabolic surgery–related literature data were collected from PubMed. The number of publications indexed to bariatric metabolic surgery had expanded rapidly. Obesity Surgery and Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases are currently the most published journals in bariatric metabolic surgery. The bariatric metabolic surgery research mainly included five topics: bariatric surgery intervention, clinical case management, basic research, body contour, and surgical risk study. Conclusion: Despite a rapid increase in bariatric metabolic surgery–related publications, few studies were still on quality of life, psychological status, and long-term follow-up. In addition, basic research has gradually increased, but the mechanism of bariatric metabolic surgery remains to be further studied. It is predicted that the above research fields may become potential hot topics in the future.

AB  - The current COVID-19 pandemic has virtually disrupted supply chains worldwide. Thus, supply chain research has received significant attention. While the impacts have been immeasurable, organizations have realized the need to design strategies to overcome such unexpected events. Therefore, the supply chain research landscape has evolved to address the challenges during the pandemic. However, available literature surveys have not explored the power of text analytics. Hence, in this review, an analysis of the supply chain literature related to the impacts of COVID-19 is performed to identify the current research trends and future research avenues. To discover the frequent topics discussed in the literature, bibliometric analysis (i.e., keyword co-occurrence network) and text mining tools (i.e., N-gram analysis and topic modeling) are employed for the whole corpus and the top-three contributing journals (i.e., Sustainability, International Journal of Logistics Management, Operations Management Research). Moreover, text analytics (i.e., Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency: TF-IDF) is utilized to discover the distinctive topics in the corpus and per journals. A total of 574 papers published up to the first semester of 2022 were collected from the Scopus database to determine the research trends and opportunities. The keyword network identified four clusters considering the implementation of digitalization to achieve resilience and sustainability, the usage of additive manufacturing during the pandemic, the study of food supply chains, and the development of supply chain decision models to tackle the pandemic. Moreover, the segmented keyword network analysis and topic modeling were performed for the top three contributors. Although both analyses draw the research concentrations per journal, the keyword network tends to provide a more general scope, while the topic modeling gives more specific topics. Furthermore, TF-IDF scores unveiled topics rarely studied, such as the implications of the pandemic on plasma supply chains, cattle supply chains, and reshoring decisions, to mention a few. Additionally, it was observed how the different methodologies implemented allowed to complement the information provided by each method. Based on the findings, future research avenues are discussed. Therefore, this research will help supply chain practitioners and researchers to identify supply chain advancements, gaps in the literature and future research streams.

The entire set of search results was retrieved in XML format, and metadata such as title, abstract, keywords, MeSH words, and year of publication were extracted for bibliometric evaluation from the original XML files. To increase the specificity of the investigation, the Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling method was applied.Our study included 5,770 research papers. By using frequency analysis of MeSH terms, research on thyroid nodules was divided into two categories: clinical and basic. The proportion of clinical research is nearing 89% and is dominated by the differential diagnosis of thyroid nodules. In contrast, the proportion of MeSH terms relating to basic research was just 11%, with DNA mutation analysis being the most common topic. Following this, LDA analysis revealed the thyroid nodule study had three clusters: Imaging Studies, Biopsy and Diagnosis, and Epidemiology and Screening of Thyroid Cancer. The result suggests that current thyroid nodule research appears to have focused on ultrasonography and histological diagnosis, which are tightly correlated. Molecular biomarker research has increased, therefore enhancing the diagnostic precision of thyroid nodules. However, inflammation, anxiety, and mental health disorders related to thyroid nodules have received little attention.Basic research on thyroid nodules has unmet research requirements. Future research could focus on developing strategies to more efficiently identify malignant nodules, exploring the mechanism of thyroid nodule development, and enhancing the quality of life of thyroid patients.

AB  - Adaptation and mitigation to the adverse impacts of rising weather and climate extremes require businesses to respond with adequate marketing strategies promoting sustained economic development. Unfortunately, the connections exploring such relationships have not been extensively investigated in the current body of literature. This study investigated the five marketing categories relating to sustainable practices (sustainable marketing, social marketing, green marketing, sustainable consumption and ecological marketing) within core research themes of climate change, global warming and sustainability from a bibliometric approach using the Scopus API. Additional topic modelling was conducted using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) unsupervised approach on downloaded abstracts to distinguish ideas communicated in time through research and publications with co-occurrences of major Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Reports and Google search queries. The results confirmed marketing strategies aligned with the theme of sustainability with little work from small developing island nations. Additionally, findings demonstrated that research exploring business strategies through green marketing directed to green consumers with sustainable supply chain management had been dominantly increasing in the literature over recent years. Similarly, social marketing associated with green consumers was a common concern for the public and academics, rising over the years with strong influence from the published IPCC Assessment Reports. This study did not explore other published databases, including climate change-related meeting transcripts and published speeches from corporate and world leaders.

AB  - Economics in Europe has become more international since the 1970s. To a certain extent, this internationalisation is also an ‘Americanisation’ as many European economists have adopted the standards and approaches of US economics. This prompts an important question: amidst this convergence, are there any fields that have managed to retain a distinctively European character? In this article, we use topic modelling and bibliometric coupling to identify European specialties between 1969 and 2002. We focus on macroeconomic articles published in the European Economic Review and compare their bibliographic references and textual content to what has been published in the top 5 journals. Despite economics internationalization since the 1970s, European macroeconomics displayed distinct characteristics across two distinct periods. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, European macroeconomists maintained a certain distance from US debates centred around rational expectations and new classical economics. However, they embraced the concept of microfoundations through the lens of disequilibrium theory, fostering transnational collaborations and offering a unique framework for addressing various macroeconomic issues. Nevertheless, both the prominence of new classical economics in the US and the decline of the disequilibrium approach after the mid-1980s, European macroeconomics shifted towards closer alignment with US approaches. In the 1990s, Political economy, inspired by pioneering US contributions like Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Barro and Gordon (1983a,b), emerged in the 1990s as a new framework offering a common language for many European macroeconomists. However, specific European challenges like high unemployment rates and European integration continued to drive research in distinctive directions.

AB  - Metaverse technology is an advanced form of virtual reality and augmented technologies. It merges the digital world with the real world, thus benefitting healthcare services. Medical informatics is promising in the metaverse. Despite the increasing adoption of the metaverse in commercial applications, a considerable research gap remains in the academic domain, which hinders the comprehensive delineation of research prospects for the metaverse in healthcare. This study employs text-mining methods to investigate the prevalence and trends of the metaverse in healthcare; in particular, more than 34,000 academic articles and news reports are analyzed. Subsequently, the topic prevalence, similarity, and correlation are measured using topic-modeling methods. Based on bibliometric analysis, this study proposes a theoretical framework from the perspectives of knowledge, socialization, digitization, and intelligence. This study provides insights into its application in healthcare via an extensive literature review. The key to promoting the metaverse in healthcare is to perform technological upgrades in computer science, telecommunications, healthcare services, and computational biology. Digitization, virtualization, and hyperconnectivity technologies are crucial in advancing healthcare systems. Realizing their full potential necessitates collective support and concerted effort toward the transformation of relevant service providers, the establishment of a digital economy value system, and the reshaping of social governance and health concepts. The results elucidate the current state of research and offer guidance for the advancement of the metaverse in healthcare.

AB  - Abstract Background The past decade has seen a substantial rise in the employment of modern data‐driven methods to study atopic dermatitis (AD)/eczema. The objective of this study is to summarise the past and future of data‐driven AD research, and identify areas in the field that would benefit from the application of these methods. Methods We retrieved the publications that applied multivariate statistics (MS), artificial intelligence (AI, including machine learning‐ML), and Bayesian statistics (BS) to AD and eczema research from the SCOPUS database over the last 50 years. We conducted a bibliometric analysis to highlight the publication trends and conceptual knowledge structure of the field, and applied topic modelling to retrieve the key topics in the literature. Results Five key themes of data‐driven research on AD and eczema were identified: (1) allergic co‐morbidities, (2) image analysis and classification, (3) disaggregation, (4) quality of life and treatment response, and (5) risk factors and prevalence. ML&amp;AI methods mapped to studies investigating quality of life, prevalence, risk factors, allergic co‐morbidities and disaggregation of AD/eczema, but seldom in studies of therapies. MS was employed evenly between the topics, particularly in studies on risk factors and prevalence. BS was focused on three key topics: treatment, risk factors and allergy. The use of AD or eczema terms was not uniform, with studies applying ML&amp;AI methods using the term eczema more often. Within MS, papers using cluster and factor analysis were often only identified with the term AD. In contrast, those using logistic regression and latent class/transition models were “eczema” papers. Conclusions Research areas that could benefit from the application of data‐driven methods include the study of the pathogenesis of the condition and related risk factors, its disaggregation into validated subtypes, and personalised severity management and prognosis. We highlight BS as a new and promising approach in AD and eczema research.

AB  - Sports management is a field of study that has grown significantly. However, little is known about its structure. Therefore, this article presents an unsupervised cluster learning approach based on a thematic analysis of abstracts. It applies to a large corpus of sports management documents to gain insight into the structure of the discipline. A total of 3,704 records were downloaded from the Scopus database. Data were processed using the BERTopic approach. The results indicate that sports management is a growing and highly collaborative field of study. The themes (or topics) were diversified (25 clusters). Due to their proximity, seven meta topics were also identified. While the interest in major sports events and the social impact of sports tourism has lessened in recent years, other fields of study, such as entrepreneurship, innovation and sports club management, have captured the interest of researchers. Keywords: Sports management, bibliometric analysis, topic modelling, BERTopic, UMAP, hDBSCAN.

AB  - This paper presents a bibliometric systematic review on model-based learning analytics (MbLA), which enable coupling between teachers and intelligent systems to support the learning process. This is achieved through systems that make their models of student learning and instruction transparent to teachers. We use bibliometric network analysis and topic modelling to explore the synergies between the related research groups and the main research topics considered in the 42 reviewed papers. Network analysis depicts an early stage community, made up of several research groups, mainly from the fields of learning analytics and intelligent tutoring systems, which have had little explicit and implicit collaboration but do share a common core literature. Th resulting topics from the topic modelling can be grouped into the ones related to teacher practices, such as awareness and reflection, learning orchestration, or assessment frameworks, and the ones related to the technology used to open up the models to teachers, such as dashboards or adaptive learning architectures. Moreover, results show that research in MbLA has taken an individualistic approach to student learning and instruction, neglecting social aspects and elements of collaborative learning. To advance research in MbLA, future research should focus on hybrid teacher–AI approaches that foster the partnership between teachers and technology to support the learning process, involve teachers in the development cycle from an early stage, and follow an interdisciplinary approach.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the landscape of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 research during the last 22 years using machine learning and text analysis.In December 2021, all publications indexed under the MeSH term "Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1" were obtained from PubMed. The whole set of search results was downloaded in XML format, and metadata such as title, abstract, keywords, mesh words, and year of publication were extracted from the original XML files for bibliometric evaluation. The Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling method was used to analyze specific themes.This study eventually contained 1,407 publications. Among them, there are 768 (54.58%) case reports and reviews. Text analysis based on MeSH words revealed that the most often studied clinical areas include therapy efficacy, prognosis, and genetic diagnosis. The majority of basic study is focused on genetic alterations. The LDA topic model further identifies three topic clusters include basic research, treatment cluster, and diagnosis cluster. In the basic research cluster, many studies are focused on the expression of Menin. The primary focus of the therapy cluster is pancreatic resections and parathyroidectomy. In the diagnose cluster, the main focus is on Genetic Diagnosis and screening strategies for Hereditary Cancer Syndrome.The current state of research on MEN1 is far from adequate. Research on rare diseases MEN1 necessitates implementing a broad research program involving multiple centers to advance MEN1 research together.

AB  - The current work aims to analyze the main themes related to artificial intelligence (AI) and sustainable development during the pandemic period. This study provides an overview of the specialized literature related to AI and sustainability from the beginning of the pandemic through 2023. The present paper analyses scientific literature emphasizing both artificial intelligence's positive and negative impacts on sustainable development objectives (SDGs). To conduct the research, we employed bibliometric analysis and text-mining techniques to identify the major themes in the literature indexed in the Web of Science and Scopus databases. Firstly, we used descriptive measures to identify the authors' impact, the article production by country, the main keywords used, and other descriptive data. We further used data reduction methods based on co-word analysis (such as multiple correspondence analysis) on authors' keywords to show patterns in the themes explored in the literature. Bibliometric analysis was supplemented by text mining using Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and structural topic modeling on abstracts to provide a comprehensive view of scientific debates on AI and sustainable development. Our research has identified various themes in the literature related to AI and sustainable development. These themes include social sustainability, health-related issues, AI technologies for energy efficiency, sustainability in industry and innovation, IoT technologies for smart and sustainable cities, urban planning, technologies for education and knowledge production, and the impact of technologies on SDGs. We also found that there is a significant positivity bias in the literature when discussing the impact of AI on sustainable development. Despite acknowledging certain risks, the literature tends to focus on the potential benefits of AI across various sectors. In addition, the analysis shows a growing emphasis on energy efficiency, which is facilitated by the use of AI technologies. Our study contributes to a better understanding of current scholarly discussion trends and emerging scientific avenues regarding AI and sustainable development. It also highlights the areas where research is needed and the implications for practitioners and policymakers.

AB  - <h2>Abstract</h2><h3>Objectives</h3> Research on technology-enhanced higher education (TEHE) has been active and influential in educational technology. The study had three objectives: (1) to recognize the tendencies in the field and the contributing countries/regions/institutions, (2) to visualize scientific collaborations, and (3) to reveal important research topics, their developmental tendencies, correlations, and distributions across contributing countries/regions/institutions. <h3>Methods</h3> We collected 609 papers in relation to TEHE from 2004 to 2022 and analyzed them using text mining and bibliometric methods. Specifically, we focused on determining article trends, identifying contributing institutions/countries/regions, visualizing scientific collaborations through social network analysis, and revealing the important topics and their conceptual evolutions over time using topic models, Mann-Kendall trend test, hierarchical clustering, and Sankey visualization. <h3>Results</h3> Regarding the first objective, TEHE articles have grown consistently and will continue to expand. This growth was due to the contributions of Spanish universities and institutions from other countries/regions such as the USA, the UK, Australia, Germany, China, and Turkey. Regarding the second objective, the exploration of regional and institutional collaborations through social networks revealed that geographically adjacent institutions tended to foster close collaborations, particularly among those sharing similar research interests. Nevertheless, more cross-regional collaborations are needed to advance TEHE research. Regarding the third objective, the analysis of topics highlighted research hotspots and emerging themes such as <i>Massive Online Open Courses</i>, <i>AI and big data in education</i>, <i>Gamification and engagement</i>, <i>Learning effectiveness and strategies</i>, <i>Social networks and discussion forums</i>, <i>COVID-19 and online learning</i>, and <i>Plagiarism detection and learning analytics</i>. <h3>Conclusions</h3> This bibliometric study comprehensively analyzed the research landscape of TEHE research regarding contributors, collaborations, and research topics, and offers a glimpse into what the future may hold. It can be used as a guide for contributors to the field to identify the current research hotspots and emerging themes.

The statistical population was the COVID-19 research projects approved in Iran in 2020. These research projects were extracted from the database of Iran national committee for ethics in biomedical research (ethics.research.ac.ir). To identify the topics of the research projects on COVID-19 for text mining the English Language titles of the projects were used, topic modeling algorithms was done by the Python programming language. Results We selected a total of 6641 COVID-19 research projects approved and conducted in 93 different Iranian universities and research centers. .of the main bulk of the research in this area had been conducted by Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, and Shiraz University of Medical Sciences including 687,662, and 351 cases respectively. COVID-19 Research projects fell into 12 topical categories including Treatment, Care needs of medical staff, Factors affecting disease severity, Mental health and preventive, Diagnostic and laboratory measures, Immunology studies, Vitamins and minerals, Cardiovascular disease, Vaccine studies, Job and life stress, Experiences of nurses, patients and their families and Prevalence and symptoms. Conclusion The results of this study clearly show the structural and topic status of research COVID-19 projects approved in Iran during the COVID-19 epidemic. Extended Abstract Background and Objectives In response to the COVID-19 epidemic, researchers around the world have conducted various studies on different dimensions of the disease. The researchers and various research teams have designed and conducted an extensive range of studies related to COVID-19 including epidemiology, disease surveillance, consequences of the disease, and clinical trials. In Iran, different ongoing or completed research projects have also been approved to identify various aspects of the disease. Research project proposals are documents prepared by researchers to carry out research projects and are formulated according to particular demands for research in the society on various subjects such as disease burden, epidemics, threats and natural factors. Therefore, this study investigated the structure and topics of COVID-19 research projects approved in Iran. Material and Methods This applied research, adopting an analytical approach, was conducted using bibliometric and text mining methods. The statistical population was the COVID-19 research projects approved in Iran in 2020. These research projects were extracted from the database of Iran national committee for ethics in biomedical research (ethics.research.ac.ir). To identify the topics of the research projects on COVID-19bytheir English titles, topic modeling algorithms were used in the Python programming language.This database, includes the bibliographic data of all research projects which have been approved by the medical sciences, received implementation ethics license. The projects related to medical sciences are registered in this database to receive an ethics code before implementation; thus, all Iranian projects within COVID-19 topical area are registered in this database before being implemented, and their bibliographic data can be retrieved and accessed. After extracting data related to the approved COVID-19 research projects from the mentioned database, a topical modeling algorithm named Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was employed to identify the topics of research projects by the English titles of COVID-19 approved research projects in Iran, using text mining techniques. Text mining process employed in this study includes three stages; (1) data preprocessing (2) implementation of text mining and visualization techniques, and (3) the analysis of results and knowledge extraction. In the present investigation, Python programming language and its libraries related to text mining, such as Gensim, NLTK, and Spacy, were used to implement text mining algorithms. Results We selected a total of 6641 COVID-19 research projects approved and conducted in 93 different Iranian universities and research centers. .of the main bulk of the research in this area had been conducted by Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, and Shiraz University of Medical Sciences including 687,662, and 351 cases respectively. The highest number of research projects approved in Iran included 1238, 796, 796 cases in April, May, and March, respectively. The results also revealed that the researchers to contribute most, as the main executor, to the approved research projects included Amir Vahedian Azimi from Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Jamshid Yazdani Charati from Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Ramin Sami from Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and Hossein Sheybani from Shahroud University of Medical Sciences each of whom had had 12 research projects approved. The results of text mining techniques also indicated that the terms COVID, patients, evaluation, hospital, and disease were among the most frequent words used in the titles of COVID-19 research projects approved in Iran.The results obtained from topical modeling have identified 12 distinct themes for the research projects in this area, including treatment, care needs of medical staff, factors of disease severity, mental health and preventive behavior, diagnostic and laboratory studies, Immunology studies, vitamins and minerals, cardiovascular diseases, vaccine studies, job and life stress, experiences of nurses, patients and their families and prevalence and symptoms. Conclusion In the present study, bibliometric and text mining techniques were applied to identify the topical structure of COVID-19 research projects approved in Iran. The results of this study clearly depicted the structural and topic status of research COVID-19 projects approved in Iran during the COVID-19 epidemic. The results seem to be useful for planners and policy-makers in research and medical organizations to identify topics that are understudied by researchers and also to formulate new research priorities and requirements in this field. Practical Implications of Research This research has used bibliometric and text mining techniques to identify the thematic structure of research projects approved by Covid-19 in Iran. The results of this study can be useful for planners and policy makers in research and medical organizations in order to identify topics that are less frequently considered by researchers and also to formulate new research priorities and requirements in this field. Ethical Considerations The present study was extracted from a research project approved by the Vice Chancellor for Research andTechnology of Gonabad University of Medical Sciences with the code A-10-1263-5. Conflict of Interest The authors state that there is no conflict of interest in the present study. Aknowledgment Researchers express their gratitude to the Vice Chancellor for Research, Technology and Infectious Diseases Research Center of Gonabad University of Medical Sciences for their financial and spiritual support of this research.

AB  - The concept of resilience has been applied in several fields of academic research and has also grown in popularity among economists. The main contribution of this article is the systematic analysis and interpretation of the existing large body of resilience literature in economics by using topic modeling, a modern machine-learning research method. The advantage of this method is that it offers a more in-depth understanding of the themes in the resilience literature as opposed to the terminological classifications typically used in bibliometric studies. The results show that the identified topics are spread widely across different subareas of economics and deal with diverse themes, such as adaptation to climate change, stability of the financial system, and various types of shocks in regional economies. The findings reveal that the literature can be divided into two domains: one that deal with incremental changes occurring over a long period of time and the other dealing with unexpected, transient, and sudden changes. Furthermore, according to the results, well-known, highly cited research papers combine knowledge from different fields. Policymakers seeking to support cutting-edge research projects may benefit from this finding, as it emphasizes the need for policy measures to enhance cross-fertilized research. El concepto de resiliencia se ha aplicado en varios campos de la investigación académica y también ha ganado popularidad entre los economistas. La principal contribución de este artículo es el análisis sistemático y la interpretación de la gran cantidad existente de literatura económica sobre resiliencia que hace uso de modelos temáticos, un moderno método de investigación de aprendizaje automático. La ventaja de este método es que ofrece una comprensión más profunda de los temas de la bibliografía sobre resiliencia, frente a las clasificaciones terminológicas que suelen utilizarse en los estudios bibliométricos. Los resultados muestran que los temas identificados se reparten ampliamente entre distintas subáreas de las ciencias de la economía y tratan temas diversos, como la adaptación al cambio climático, la estabilidad del sistema financiero y diversos tipos de perturbaciones en las economías regionales. Los resultados revelan que la bibliografía puede dividirse en dos ámbitos: uno que trata de los cambios graduales que se producen durante un largo periodo de tiempo y otro que trata de los cambios inesperados, transitorios y repentinos. Además, según los resultados, los trabajos de investigación conocidos y citados frecuentemente combinan conocimientos de campos diferentes. Los responsables políticos que deseen apoyar proyectos de investigación de vanguardia pueden beneficiarse de este hallazgo, ya que pone de relieve la necesidad de medidas políticas para potenciar una investigación que fomente la fecundación cruzada. レジリエンスの概念は複数の学術研究分野で採用されており、経済学者の間でも人気が高まっている。本稿の主な趣旨は、現代の機械学習研究方法であるトピックモデリングを使用して、経済学におけるレジリエンスに関する大量の既存の研究論文を体系的に分析し解釈することである。この方法の利点は、書誌学研究で一般的に使用される用語分類とは対照的に、レジリエンスに関する研究論文のテーマをより深く理解できることである。結果から、気候変動への適応、金融システムの安定性、地域経済の様々な種類のショックなど、特定された研究トピックは経済学の様々な下位分野に広く分散しており、多様なテーマが扱われていることが示された。知見から、研究論文は2つの分野に分けられることが明らかになった。1つは長期にわたって起こる漸進的な変化を扱うものであり、もう1つは、予期せぬ、一時的な、突然の変化を扱う分野である。さらには、その結果から、著名で引用数の多い論文は、他の分野の知識を組み合わせている。この知見は、学際的研究を強化するための政策措置の必要性が強調しており、最先端の研究プロジェクトの支援を考える政策立案者はこの知見の恩恵を受ける可能性がある。

AB  - Abstract Policymakers and funding agencies tend to support scientific work across disciplines, thereby relying on indicators for interdisciplinarity. Recently, text-based quantitative methods have been proposed for the computation of interdisciplinarity that hold promise to have several advantages over the bibliometric approach. In this paper, we provide a systematic analysis of the computation of the text-based Rao index, based on probabilistic topic models, comparing a classical LDA model versus a neural network topic model. We provide a systematic analysis of model parameters that affect the diversity scores and make the interaction between its different components explicit. We present an empirical study on a real data set, upon which we quantify the diversity of the research within several departments of Fraunhofer and Max Planck Society by means of scientific abstracts published in Scopus between 2008 and 2018. Our experiments show that parameter variations, i.e. the choice of the Number of topics, hyper-parameters, and size and balance of the underlying data used for training the model, have a strong effect on the topic model-based Rao metrics. In particular, we could observe that the quality of the topic models impacts on the downstream task of computing the Rao index. Topic models that yield semantically cohesive topics are less affected by fluctuations when varying over the number of topics, and result in more stable measurements of the Rao index.

AB  - Construction robotics has emerged as a leading technology in the construction industry. This paper conducts an innovative dual-track quantitative comprehensive method to analyze the current literature and assess future trends. First, a bibliometric review of 955 journal articles published between 1974 and 2023 was performed, exploring keywords, journals, countries, and clusters. Furthermore, a neural topic model based on BERTopic addresses topic modeling repetition issues. The study identifies building information modeling (BIM), human–robot collaboration (HRC), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as "three pillars" in the field. Additionally, we systematically reviewed the relevant literature and nested symbiotic relationships. The outcome of this study is twofold: first, the findings provide quantitative and qualitative scientific guidance for future research on trends; second, the innovative dual-track quantitative analysis research methodology simultaneously stimulates critical thinking about the modeling of other similarly trending topics characterized to avoid high degree of homogeneity and corpus overlap.

AB  - Cancer rehabilitation with its broad scope has posed challenges in defining the medical knowledge expected within Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (PM&R) residency training. Impairments and functional limitations seen in patients with cancer are driven by a wide range of factors including type of cancer, type of treatment, stage or phase of disease, and time course considerations, as well as underlying health comorbidities. The high incidence of disabling complications seen with cancer and its treatment has long been recognized,1-3 and continues to be verified per more recent evidence.4-7 A survey of 1514 cancer survivors ranked physical needs (including pain) as the most common category of unmet needs—over financial, emotional, communication, body image, and multiple other categories.8 Advocacy efforts are increasing momentum toward better-optimized integration of rehabilitation into oncology care.9 The Commission on Cancer of the American College of Surgeons, an accrediting body for numerous cancer programs, requires that programs make rehabilitation care accessible to patients.10 With the number of cancer survivors currently estimated at more than 15 million people in the United States, and with 67.1 of people with cancer diagnoses surviving more than 5 years,11 PM&R trainees will encounter cancer patients and survivors in their future physiatry practices, whether they have an intent to focus on the cancer population or not. Toward meeting the rehabilitation needs of cancer patients and survivors, educating the rehabilitation workforce, including physiatrists, is increasingly recognized as a priority. The Institute of Medicine's (IOM's) 2006 report "From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Transition12 lists intervention as one of the four essential components of survivorship care (along with prevention, surveillance, and coordination), most components of which physiatrists are well positioned to address. Regarding priorities for intervention, the report specifically notes the need for attention to "medical problems such as lymphedema and sexual dysfunction; symptoms, including pain and fatigue; psychological distress experienced by cancer survivors and their caregivers; and concerns related to employment, insurance, and disability." Toward meeting these needs, Recommendation 7 of the IOM report focuses on the educational needs of health care providers, including to "update undergraduate and graduate curricula for those in training." In 2015, the Rehabilitation Medicine Department of the National Institutes of Health convened an interdisciplinary Subject Matter Expert Group in cancer rehabilitation, to make recommendations for future efforts to promote quality cancer rehabilitation care, which also had educational goals as one of its recommendations, specifically to "expand cancer-related education and training among rehabilitation providers" including through residency and fellowship programs.13 The Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) has developed standards for cancer rehabilitation, published in the 2014 CARF Medical Rehabilitation Standards Manual, for application across inpatient, outpatient, and community-based programs, with emphasis on a person-centered approach, collaboration across the cancer care continuum, quality improvement, and holistic interdisciplinary care.14 But, what exactly is priority cancer rehabilitation knowledge content for physiatrists in training? Cancer rehabilitation educational objectives for PM&R residents have not been consistently outlined, making it difficult to set expectations for residents and for trainees to get consistent exposure to the patient population. Medical knowledge Milestones have been developed for PM&R subspecialty domains including brain disorders, stroke, amputation, nerve and muscle, musculoskeletal disorders, pain, pediatric disorders, and spasticity, but not for cancer.15 Current literature as to coverage of cancer rehabilitation in residency programs provides limited information. Raj et al16 surveyed PM&R residency program directors, receiving responses from 38 programs, a 48% response rate, and finding that 32% of responding programs did not have dedicated faculty for cancer rehabilitation, only 26% had outpatient clinics focused on the rehabilitation needs related to cancer, and 74% of programs included 3 hours or fewer of cancer rehabilitation content in the overall didactic curriculum. Although this survey obtained important information as to the overall infrastructure for cancer rehabilitation education within PM&R residency programs, it did not focus specifically on educational content areas. In a response to that article, Ferrao et al17 described one Brazilian program, noting that of 441 new patients seen within the rehabilitation residency program, the most common diagnoses were breast, head and neck, hematologic, and brain cancers, with most common impairments of pain, limited range of motion, lymphedema, hemiparesis, and fatigue. Sharma et al18 surveyed 37 cancer rehabilitation physicians, 60% of whom were practicing in an academic medical setting. Medical knowledge domains were not a major focus of the survey; however, 65% of respondents strongly agreed or agreed that cancer rehabilitation physiatrists should be well informed about opioid prescribing. In this article, we aim to propose a framework of core medical knowledge domains for cancer rehabilitation medicine via a combination of (1) assessing common threads in review literature to date, followed by (2) a consolidation and consensus process. This study takes the form of subtopic review of prior cancer rehabilitation compilations, with the goal of canvassing the collective discernment of experts in the field of cancer rehabilitation and assessing the frequency with which specific subtopics have been included. Following this data gathering phase, an expert consensus process was undertaken to consolidate this material and formulate recommendations. The authors began with textbooks, journal articles, and compilations in the field, supplemented by searching "cancer rehabilitation" via PubMed, Google Scholar, and general Google as of 1 July 2018. The timeline included 1990 to present. Although there was no limit on nation of origin, the review was limited to materials published in the English-language literature. Each source document was determined to encompass the field of cancer rehabilitation medicine generally, and be organized into subtopics. Included materials consisted of textbooks, chapters, journal review articles, supplements, "special issues," web-based resources, and even educational newsletters, either written by physiatrists or otherwise determined to be of relevance to physiatry practice of cancer rehabilitation medicine. Materials designed along a case-based format could be included if the subtopic themes of the cases were readily discernable in an introductory heading or sentence. Materials were excluded if the entire body of work was deemed to be focused on a narrower clinical base (eg, content being restricted to a particular type of cancer or type of impairment, such as "prostate cancer" or "fatigue") or any other narrowed focus, such as specific phase of care or therapy discipline. Materials were excluded if determined to be more directed to other audiences such as oncologists or nonphysicians, in generally erring on the side of broader inclusion. Materials that were clearly intended as marketing materials for an organization were excluded. Abstracts and editorials were excluded. Longer articles that were largely opinion pieces could be included if there was an overall general focus with breakdown into specific subtopic areas. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses could be included if data or conclusions were presented incorporating cancer rehabilitation subtopics, but excluded if they did not. The initial compilation was performed by one of the authors (M.V.) and then reviewed among several other authors (M.C., A.K., S.C.H.) for possible additional materials and to finalize inclusions and exclusions. In cases for which it was not straightforward whether to include a source, a majority of individuals had to be in favor. In the case of textbooks, which typically had repeated editions, often by the same author(s), with little change in structure (including subtopics) over time, the decision was made to include only the most recent edition of the particular textbook, to avoid overrepresentation. This did mean that some previous textbook editions that had changed substantially, or changed somewhat, were excluded. Cancer rehabilitation subtopics from these various sources were compiled on an Excel spreadsheet. Like topics were lumped together, for example, "osteosarcoma/soft tissue sarcoma" and "amputation and limb sparing" for physiatry purposes were considered as one category. However "breast cancer" and "lymphedema" were considered separate categories, because, despite considerable overlap, each of these categories also features major areas of nonoverlap. In infrequent cases, a heading was included in two categories, for example, a subtopic like "mobility in the critical care patient" might be included in both "mobility" and "critical care" categories, or "prehabilitation for breast cancer" would be included in both "prehabilitation" and "breast cancer" domains. If in doubt whether categories should be lumped or split, they were kept separate in the initial data collection phase of the process. In the second phase of the study, the authors undertook a consensus process in which the information was reviewed and synthesized, toward identifying a manageable number of "domains" of knowledge for cancer rehabilitation. First, a raw list of subtopics was generated, from most-frequent to least-frequent subtopics. These subtopics were then evaluated by the authors against less frequently occurring, yet still potentially important, subtopics to assess for pure redundancy, opportunities for consolidation of related subtopics, and possible reordering of the prioritization for this particular learner group. For example, the subtopic "outpatient rehabilitation," in addition to being its own subtopic, might also be folded into a subtopic cluster called "settings of care." Such subtopic "clusters" were integrated into the overall subtopic listing. From this integrated subtopic listing, a further review process was performed with the overriding goal of identifying topics of maximum relevance to PM&R trainees. The majority of the above-described consensus process was performed by the authors, who are involved in resident education as well as in clinical cancer rehabilitation medicine, and span a range of experience from recent fellowship graduate to 30 years in practice. A secondary part of this consensus phase was additional scrutiny of the chosen domains by wider groups. Early in the process, the raw data was presented at the October 2018 meeting of the Cancer Rehabilitation Physician Consortium (CRPC) of the American Academy of PM&R, with opportunity for input. Later, as final recommendations were approached, the identified priority subtopics were scrutinized by the entire Education subgroup of the CRPC. Thirty-four resources (Table 1)13, 19-51 were assessed including 12 papers (review articles, study guides, or position papers), 9 chapters, 9 compilations (special issues, textbooks, or article series), and 4 web-based information sites, and one which was a "grand rounds" within institution-sponsored material. The entire data set can be found in Table S1 (incorporating clusters, see next paragraph). Among the raw data, the most frequently occurring subtopics (in order) were breast cancer, lymphedema, pain, amputation and limb sparing, fatigue, bone metastasis/bone health, brain neoplasm, cognition, exercise, head and neck cancer, radiation effects/fibrosis, sexuality, chemotherapy toxicities/principles, hematologic malignancies, and palliative care. At review of the entire subtopic list, some subtopics were synthesized into clusters (Table S2). With the clusters incorporated, the top domains were Neurologic (brain/spinal cord/peripheral nerve) cluster, Operational cluster, Fitness/Fatigue/Mobility cluster, Abdominopelvic cluster, Pain cluster, Peripheral/other Neurologic cluster, Cancer treatment cluster, Musculoskeletal/soft issue cluster (including amputation and limb sparing), Brain and cognition cluster, Head and neck cluster, Medical complexity cluster, Hematologic cluster, Breast cancer, Lymphedema, and Bone health/bone metastasis/spine cluster. Upon subsequent review, a decision was made to remove the Operational and Abdominopelvic clusters, as pertinent to more advanced learners, such as fellows, advanced PM&R residents, or physiatrists in practice. A decision was also made to remove the Pain cluster, with the rationale that pain management figures heavily within many of the other subtopics, and also because pain management is generally already a prominent focus of PM&R residencies, with cancer-related pain management strategies over and above that likely more pertinent to advanced learners. The final framework of knowledge domains includes major categories of Treatments and Effects, Performance/Function, Lymphedema, Neurologic, Breast Cancer, Head and Neck, Bone Health and Bone Metastasis, Osteosarcoma and Sarcoma, and Hematologic. These topic recommendations are diagrammed in Figure 1 with subcategories. To our knowledge, this work is the first of its kind to outline core Medical Knowledge domains in cancer rehabilitation for PM&R residents, employing a systematic process. Although a beginning step, the main intent is to flag for PM&R programs and for PM&R residents themselves core areas to prioritize. As this model is applied and tested, it is likely that modifications may be appropriate in the future. Because accrediting and board entities related to physiatry have not currently outlined discrete expectations for cancer rehabilitation competency upon completion of residency training, it is hoped that the recommendations herein foster an evolution toward clearer guidance at summative levels. We also recognize that many if not most programs will not be able to incorporate patient care experiences for PM&R residents in all of these topic areas. Some patient populations that are important to cancer rehabilitation as a field, such as osteosarcoma and bone marrow transplant patients, are treated in highly specialized cancer care settings, which will be far removed geographically from some PM&R programs. Therefore, the intent of this work is not to "mandate" clinical experiences. However, programs are highly encouraged to provide clinical experiences for PM&R residents within the resources of their affiliated cancer care institution(s), especially for the more common cancers. Many topic areas and concepts important to cancer rehabilitation are not specifically included in this final framework. Pain and Precautions represent two notable examples. Both of these subtopics are considered to permeate the various selected categories. We considered having categories of Psychosocial effects and Communication, because of their clinical importance, but ultimately decided against this due to the lack of coverage in the PM&R literature for this patient population (including only modest presence in our subtopic analysis). Domains considered to be a better fit for advanced learners (such as fellows) include the Operational cluster (which includes categories related to rehabilitation settings, care models, and financial factors), Research, Phase of care (Prehabilitation, During-Treatment, Survivorship, End-of-Life), Pediatric/Geriatric cancer concerns, Medical Complexity, as well as an enhanced knowledge base of Disease-related information (such as statistics/demographics, neoplasia principles, staging, trajectory, prognosis, common treatment protocols and disease markers, and so on), and more in-depth knowledge of cancer-related imaging and diagnostics. Other subtopics we considered but ultimately did not include were Nutrition, Sexuality, Skin/wound, Employment, and certain other cancer types (Lung, Melanoma, and the various Abdominopelvic malignancies), as well as social and political subtopics (History/advocacy/public policy). Ultimately, though, we acknowledge that distinctions between inclusion and noninclusion in the framework can veer toward being artificial, as underlying principles applicable to many of these nonincluded categories are encompassed within our proposed framework. While obvious, it must be emphatically stated that the creation of the above domains is not meant to limit resident study of cancer rehabilitation medicine, or to supplant existing residency program initiatives and priorities in cancer rehabilitation education that may fall outside of these selected domains. Rather, the goal is to more clearly define minimum knowledge expectations, the "base," which the authors hope will serve to foster a concrete and feasible framework for all PM&R residents to be prepared to encounter cancer patients and survivors in practice. The framework also forms a reference point to use when formulating goals for other groups of learners, such as cancer rehabilitation fellows, for whom additional domains may be applicable, as noted in the preceding paragraph. We also recognize that these recommendations straddle a gray zone between being evidence-based and consensus based, and are heavily weighted toward the latter. In general, literature compilations will gravitate toward topics for which some evidence can be presented, but entail a predigested format that is influenced by other factors including editorial decisions and the experience of individual authors and so on. And our consensus process is further layered on top of that. But, as a recent editorial points out, with respect to clinical guidelines (which under ideal conditions drive educational priorities), the fixed dichotomy with which evidence-based versus consensus-based guidelines tends to be viewed in many respects can actually be a false distinction, as low-quality evidence may be the "best available" evidence in some circumstances, interpretation of evidence is a key component of consensus processes, and the traditional bar for high-quality evidence, the randomized controlled study, may have limitations in being generalized to specific real-life patient-care scenarios.52 In our analysis, we utilized a platform of data, which while itself derivative, served to inform and enrich our consensus process. With regard to systematically exploring specific subtopics published in the cancer rehabilitation literature, Stout et al53 performed a bibliometric analysis, utilizing a computerized topic modeling technique. In contrast to our study, their digital methodology allowed a highly expansive approach and assessed 22 171 publications. By type of cancer, the highest frequency in the cancer rehabilitation literature was for breast neoplasms, especially with regard to articles focusing on "adaptation, psychological," "exercise therapy," and "exercise." The greatest volume of publications overall centered on surgical treatments, including reconstruction, surgical procedures, and postoperative complications. However, this study was focused predominantly on a research rather than educational context, and its authors pointed out the "lack of notable publication on many commonly occurring functional impairments such as neuropathy, bone fragility, and bone and soft tissue restrictions" [which are] "prevalent and functionally debilitating." Thus, with the current state of the literature, purely focusing on published evidence, at least by number of publications, may have limitations in identification of the issues that are most meaningfully important in education for clinical care. For the literature analysis, reasonable efforts were made to be comprehensive, but it is possible and even highly likely that some resources were missed. Decisions to cluster some topics into one domain, versus separate others into individual domains, may be inherently imperfect and perhaps even arbitrary. Of the included literature works, some are overrepresented compared to others, as the range of subtopic number in each individual work spanned from 5 topics at the fewest to 69 subtopics at the most (average 16.8 and median 15). However, we believe that the overall impact of these limitations is negligible, because the purpose of the literature overview was not that absolute numbers should dictate the recommendations, but rather that the literature subtopic analysis would provide a broad landscape from which recurring themes could be gleaned, as well as serve as a safety net of sorts, such that important subtopic areas would not escape consideration. In short, the literature overview provided important initial guidance, but not did not solely drive the recommendations. After literature topic overview and consensus process, a framework of cancer rehabilitation Medical Knowledge domains for physiatry training is proposed. Future work will need to track the implementation of this model for feasibility, with possible need for future modifications including more detailed content, delineation of level-of-training milestones, and adjustments as research and clinical practice evolve. In addition, establishing medical knowledge frameworks for other groups of learners, such as medical students, cancer rehabilitation fellows, and other advanced learners, remains a need toward which this current work can provide a point of reference.

AB  - Integrated Water Resource Assessment (IWRA) is a multidisciplinary analysis of cause-effect interactions of environmental, social, and economic processes which play an important role in an investigated scenario or undertaking related to a water resource.The goal of this analysis is to generate new knowledge in support of decision or policy making.The concept of IWRA covering natural processes in a water resource with at least one of the areas of economic or social aspects of modern society had been articulated almost a half a century ago.Nowadays, it became mature to the extent of supporting environmental sustainability and promoting UN Sustainable Development Goals through offering well-accepted approaches, frameworks, simulation models and computational techniques upholding the assessment.Nevertheless, there is steady interest to the issues of IWRA among researchers and practitioners because new technologies open opportunities for advanced computational techniques and comprehensive analysis.This study presents exploratory analysis of the corpus of scientific publications using text mining techniques with the aim to identify salient topics and potential gaps in the IWRA research area.The analysis was conducted based on the topic modelling approach.Topic modelling is a form of text mining that allows to find a representation of information from a collection of documents called corpus.Any text document can be viewed as a collection of several themes which are present in the document and reflect the document contents in a meaningful to its readers way.A theme or a topic is represented via an array of words that have a high tendency of co-occurrence when a particular theme underlying a document is being discussed.The most salient characteristic of topic models is that they automate the process of extracting these underlying (latent) themes in large corpora of texts without any human intervention excluding text pre-processing.Given that a topic model operates with a fixed vocabulary, domain specific analysis is expected to be more informative.Therefore, careful selection of documents included into a corpus is required.Application of topic modelling to multidisciplinary areas such as IWRA carries more importance because it helps to automate the process of extraction of salient topics relevant to a document and categorize the documents into themes for targeted analysis and knowledge extraction.The corpus of abstracts of 89726 papers published from 1970 to 2020 in peer-reviewed journals representing leading outlets in the areas of water resources and integrated environmental assessment was assembled.It was analysed using basic bibliometric statistics.After that, the corpus was pre-processed following conventional topic modelling framework and fed into LDA mallet algorithm to identify salient topics.Hyperparameters of the selected topic modelling algorithm were identified based on exploratory computations and evaluation of several topic models performance using a coherence score and qualitative evaluation of the identified topics.The model producing 20 topics was considered satisficing and used as a basis for the qualitative analysis of clusters of words forming topics.The analysis revealed two categories of latent topics presented in the corpus: methodological and environmental.The latter describes various aspects of utilization, protection, and restoration of a natural water resources.No theme reflecting assessment of socio-economic processes was uncovered despite the fact, that these processes play critical role in the environmental state of a water resource.

AB  - Localization in a dynamic environment is one of the challenges in WSN localization involving dynamic sensor nodes or anchor nodes. Mobile anchors can be an efficient solution for the number of anchors in a 3-dimensional environment requiring more local anchors. The reliability of a localization system using mobile anchors is determined by various parameters such as energy efficiency, coverage, computational complexity, and cost. Various methods have been proposed by researchers to build a reliable mobile anchor localization system. This certainly shows the many research opportunities that can be carried out in mobile anchor localization. The many opportunities in this topic will be very confusing for researchers who want to research in this field in choosing a topic area early. However, until now there is still no paper that discusses systematic mapping studies that can provide information on topic areas and trends in the field of mobile anchor localization. A systematic Mapping Study (SMS) was conducted to determine the topic area and its trends, influential authors, and produce modeling topics and trends from the resulting modeling topics. This SMS can be a solution for researchers who are interested in research in the field of mobile anchor localization in determining the research topics they are interested in for further research. This paper gives information on the mobile anchor research area, the author who has influenced mobile anchor localization research, and the topic modeling and trend that potentially promissing research in the future. The SMS includes a chronology of publications from 2017-2022, bibliometric co-occurrence, co-author analysis, topic modeling, and trends. The results show that the development of mobile anchor localization publications is still developing until 2022. There are 10 topic models with 6 of them included in the promising topic. The results of this SMS can be used as preliminary research from the literacy stage, namely Systematic Literature Review (SLR).

AB  - Publication of research outputs is a method of researchers to capture their knowledge generated. Analysing the publication topics and trends in a research field can provide insight into the main research trends. A bibliometric analysis, based on the topics from published literature, provides insight into the focus areas and trends of a research field. The objective of this paper is to extract the main research topics from papers on 'sustainable development' and 'information communication technology'. The research topics are extracted from the abstracts and titles of papers using machine-learning for topic modelling. This paper identified the topics of knowledge management, design process, social change, and smart systems, as the primary focus of research into information communication technology for sustainable development. A deeper analysis into smart systems identified quality of citizen life, solutions for the urban setting, energy, and the environment as key research concerns.

AB  - Artificial intelligence tools are new in taphonomy and are growing fast. They are being used mainly to investigate bone surface marks. In order to investigate this subject, a bibliometric study was made to understand the growing rate of this intersectional field, the future, and gaps in the field until now. From Scopus and Google Scholar metadata, graphs were made to describe the data, and inferential statistics were made by regression with the Ordinary Least Squares method. Exploratory analysis with word clouds, topic modeling, and natural language processing with Latent Dirichlet Allocation as a method were also made using the entire corpus from the papers. From the first register until 2023, we found eight articles in Scopus and 32 in Google Scholar; the majority of the studies and the most cited were from Spain. The studies are growing fast from 2016 to 2018, and the regression shows that growth can be maintained in the coming years. Exploratory analysis shows the most frequent words are marks, models, data, and bone. Topic modeling shows that the studies are highly concentrated on similar problems and the tools to solve them, revealing that there is much more to explore with computational tools in taphonomy and paleontology as well.

AB  - The financial sector has undergone a significant transformation with the advent of financial technology (FinTech), which has put pressure on the business models of incumbents and has raised several concerns, including some related to instances of misbehavior. This article examines the existing body of literature on misconduct in the FinTech industry, encompassing a range of unethical behaviors, the underlying causes that contribute to such activities, and viable strategies to alleviate associated concerns. We employ a bibliometric and scientometric analysis, as well as topic modeling, a machine learning approach applied to natural language.

AB  - The relationship between academic finance research and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) has gained increasing attention over recent years. This study conducts a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between the UN SDGs and scholarly output in financial journals from 2010 to 2022. Utilizing a framework that combines fuzzy matching, bibliometric analysis, and topic modelling techniques, the research traces the evolution of finance research and its alignment with the UN SDGs. Our findings indicate that academic finance research is unevenly spread across the SDG's. Key areas around the natural world, sustainability and climate change are underresearched. The implications of our study are significant for both academic scholars and policymakers, suggesting a need for strategic redirection in research priorities to better support global sustainability initiatives in the future.

AB  - As a hot topic in the field of library and information, the research on topic recognition and trend prediction has been paid close attention by academic circles. This paper uses a systematic literature review, bibliometric analyses and classification methods. Through a systematic literature review, 96 studies about topic identification and evolution prediction models are selected from the CNKI database. By using VOSviewer to conduct bibliometric analyses, the key research content and themes are revealed. Through the classification method, EXCEL is used to summarize models and algorithms used in the literature comprehensively. It is found that topic identification models and algorithms can be divided into four categories: ① Topic model based on LDA and related derivative models. ② Machine learning and deep learning methods. ③ Methods based on reference relation. ④ Text mining methods. Trend prediction models and algorithms mainly cover two categories: ① deep learning or machine learning models and algorithms based on time sequence; ② link prediction algorithms based on complex network. At the same time, we have also summarized the common index system involved in each study and the way to evaluate the effectiveness of the method, thus this paper comprehensively reveals the application progress in academic circles of topic identification and prediction models and algorithms from the last 10 years and beyond, based on the CNKI database. The purpose is to determine the most popular models and algorithms applied in research, generalize the corresponding indicator systems and validation methods, and finally provide references for model choice or evaluation when identifying and predicting topics in the future. Thus, this paper can help us to understand the overall progress made in text analysis research, and provides a useful reference for selecting and applying the appropriate models, algorithms and indicators.

AB  - Blockchain video games, specifically video games using blockchain technology, are a trending topic in the media, technology community and business world. While blockchain video games are expected to transform the industry, little is known about how they are played and the players accordingly. The paper presents a 3-stage literature overview study on blockchain video games combining methods of topic modelling, bibliometric analysis, and narrative literature review. In a systematic approach, 1883 articles are screened. Language models are built on 1246 papers, and 70 articles directly related to blockchain video games have been analysed. The results indicate that most recent studies focus on blockchain technology and its financial characteristics instead of players. Hence, more play-oriented blockchain video game research is needed. Future studies may focus on different types of blockchain video games, game design and playability, players' experiences, and critical reviews.

AB  - OBJECTIVES/GOALS: The goal of this project was to perform an exploratory analysis of the research themes of scientific publications from the Miami Clinical and Translational Science Institute using text mining techniques and using bibliometric characterization and network analysis to further assess research trends. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Publications were identified from the Web of Science database using Miami CTSI grant numbers as search criteria for the period 2013-2021 and KL2 scholar publications. Following data pre-processing, topic modeling was performed using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm and cluster analysis in the R programming language. The resulting themes will be further analyzed by employing a citation-based impact assessment approach to identify trends over time. Network analysis of publications will be performed using the VOSviewer package to visualize publication networks using citation and co-authorship relations within each major theme and their evolution over time. Findings will be evaluated for alignment with institutional research strategy. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: About 400 CTSI publications from 2013-2021 to date were used for analysis. Twenty topics and five major research themes were identified among the Miami CTSI publications – neuroscience, cancer, community and public health, metabolics, and HIV/infectious diseases. Top keywords within each topic were aligned with the most frequent author-assigned keywords for that topic. The CTSI research themes were also well-aligned with the institutional vision for research and focus areas. Trends using citations and networks for each research theme are currently being analyzed and results will be included in the overall findings post analysis. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Text mining was successfully used in identifying topics and research themes for clinical and translational research publications of the Miami CTSI, and in combination with bibliometric characterization, will be helpful in shaping CTSI strategy and alignment with the universitys research priorities.

AB  - Objective: Despite the increasing importance of lead generation research in increasing product or market share, cost and resource constraints have become a challenge for SMEs.Therefore, this study aims to explore and reveal research themes and market trends hidden in articles on lead generation over the past 10 years. . Theoretical Framework: In this study, qualitative and quantitative methods are combined, and three methods of bibliometrics, network analysis and BERTopic topic modeling are used to analyze the literature. Method: A total of 7446 articles were analysed using bibliometrics, network analysis and BERTopic thematic modelling as the basis of a mixed method approach. Results and Discussion: The study found that the field is currently experiencing a downward trend after a phase of rapid growth. During this period, the United States and China were the countries with the highest number of articles accounting for 77% of the total; the Journal of Cleaner Journal of Cleaner Production was the most cited journal. In addition, the potential user studies cover 43 mainstream topics, focusing on 6 aspects . In the in-depth analysis of the theme evolution, it was found that the potential user study gradually evolved from the initial multidimensional application to focus on open service, and was more oriented towards the public service field. Research Implications: This provides a strong theoretical basis and practical guidance for identifying potential customers and increasing conversion rates and revenues. Originality/Value: To our knowledge, this is the first study to use a mixed-methods approach to lead generation, which will help researchers to tackle more complex challenges and changes in the future.

AB  - The financial sector, by mobilizing capital, is fundamental to adapt and mitigate the impact of climate change in the economy. This has led to the emergence of a new research field, climate finance, where experts are starting to harness Machine Learning (ML) as a tool to solve new problems, due to the need to use big datasets and to model complex non-linear relationships. We propose a review of the academic literature that goes beyond the existing bibliometric studies in the field, with the aim of identifying relevant application domains of this technology to inform ML experts where and how their modeling expertise may add value in climate finance. To achieve this, we first assemble a corpus of texts from three scientific databases and use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling, to uncover seven research areas which we label as: natural hazards, biodiversity, agricultural risk, carbon markets, energy economics, Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors & investing, and climate data. Second, we perform an analysis of publication trends, which confirms that ML is growing both in breadth and depth in climate finance, in particular topics related to energy economics, ESG factors and climate data. Interestingly, some methods stand out in each area, based on data characteristics and modeling requirements.

AB  - Understanding and monitoring soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks is crucial for ecosystem carbon cycling, services, and addressing global environmental challenges. This study employs the BERTopic model and bibliometric trend analysis exploration to comprehensively analyze global SOC estimates. BERTopic, a topic modeling technique based on BERT (bidirectional encoder representatives from transformers), integrates recent advances in natural language processing. The research analyzed 1761 papers on SOC and remote sensing (RS), in addition to 490 related papers on machine learning (ML) techniques. BERTopic modeling identified nine research themes for SOC estimation using RS, emphasizing spectral prediction models, carbon cycle dynamics, and agricultural impacts on SOC. In contrast, for the literature on RS and ML it identified five thematic clusters: spatial forestry analysis, hyperspectral soil analysis, agricultural deep learning, the multitemporal imaging of farmland SOC, and RS platforms (Sentinel-2 and synthetic aperture radar, SAR). From 1991 to 2023, research on SOC estimation using RS and ML has evolved from basic mapping to topics like carbon sequestration and modeling with Sentinel-2A and big data. In summary, this study traces the historical growth and thematic evolution of SOC research, identifying synergies between RS and ML and focusing on SOC estimation with advanced ML techniques. These findings are critical to global ecosystem SOC assessments and environmental policy formulation.

AB  - Forest habitats are critical for biodiversity, ecosystem services, human livelihoods, and well-being. Capacity to conduct theoretical and applied forest ecology research addressing direct (e.g., deforestation) and indirect (e.g., climate change) anthropogenic pressures has benefited considerably from new field- and statistical- techniques. We used machine learning and bibliometric structural topic modelling to identify 20 latent topics comprising four principal fields from a corpus of 16,952 forest ecology/forestry articles published in eight ecology and five forestry journals between 2010 and 2022. Articles published per year increased from 820 in 2010 to 2,354 in 2021, shifting toward more applied topics. Publications from some countries in North America, Europe, and China dominated, with relatively fewer articles from some countries in West and Central Africa and West Asia, despite globally important forest resources. Most study sites were in North America, Central Asia, South America, and Australia. R statistical software predominated articles, increasing from 29.5% of articles in 2010 to 71.4% in 2022, principally lme4, vegan, nlme, MuMIn, ggplot2, car, MASS, mgcv, multcomp and raster packages. R was more often used in forest ecology than applied forestry articles. R software has script and workflow-sharing advantages over competing statistical packages. Our findings demonstrate that the disciplines of forest ecology/forestry are expanding in number and scope, aided by more sophisticated statistical tools, to tackle the challenges of redressing forest habitat loss and the socio-economic impacts of deforestation.

AB  - Classifying scientific publications according to Field-of-Science taxonomies is of crucial importance, powering a wealth of relevant applications including Search Engines, Tools for Scientific Literature, Recommendation Systems, and Science Monitoring. Furthermore, it allows funders, publishers, scholars, companies, and other stakeholders to organize scientific literature more effectively, calculate impact indicators along Science Impact pathways and identify emerging topics that can also facilitate Science, Technology, and Innovation policy-making. As a result, existing classification schemes for scientific publications underpin a large area of research evaluation with several classification schemes currently in use. However, many existing schemes are domain-specific, comprised of few levels of granularity, and require continuous manual work, making it hard to follow the rapidly evolving landscape of science as new research topics emerge. Based on our previous work of scinobo, which incorporates metadata and graph-based publication bibliometric information to assign Field-of-Science fields to scientific publications, we propose a novel hybrid approach by further employing Neural Topic Modeling and Community Detection techniques to dynamically construct a Field-of-Science taxonomy used as the backbone in automatic publication-level Field-of-Science classifiers. Our proposed Field-of-Science taxonomy is based on the OECD fields of research and development (FORD) classification, developed in the framework of the Frascati Manual containing knowledge domains in broad (first level(L1), one-digit) and narrower (second level(L2), two-digit) levels. We create a 3-level hierarchical taxonomy by manually linking Field-of-Science fields of the sciencemetrix Journal classification to the OECD/FORD level-2 fields. To facilitate a more fine-grained analysis, we extend the aforementioned Field-of-Science taxonomy to level-4 and level-5 fields by employing a pipeline of AI techniques. We evaluate the coherence and the coverage of the Field-of-Science fields for the two additional levels based on synthesis scientific publications in two case studies, in the knowledge domains of Energy and Artificial Intelligence. Our results showcase that the proposed automatically generated Field-of-Science taxonomy captures the dynamics of the two research areas encompassing the underlying structure and the emerging scientific developments.
